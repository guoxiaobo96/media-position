when it comes to making decisions, i wouldn't exactly say i'm good at it. indecisive is definitely a word i would use to describe myself.
i'm always worried i'm going to make the wrong decision and that the decision i do make will have catastrophic repercussions. perhaps my anxiety disorder plays a part with this, as i'm someone who will always play out the worst case scenario in my head, no matter the circumstance.
the decision around having another child is something that plays on my mind a lot. 6 months ago i was resolute in my decision i didn't want to add to my family. an opinion that was shared by my other half, in fact he was probably even stauncher with this attitude than i was.
we considered permanent methods of contraception and discussed the best course of action for us. 9 months ago i was even contemplating sterilization. that's how confident i was that another child wouldn't be on the agenda.
more recently the subject of a vasectomy was mooted. research informed me it would perhaps be the less invasive route to undertake and my partner was more than happy to take one for the team as it were.
we agreed that after christmas we'd head to our gp and get the ball rolling so to speak.
new year soon rolls around and i've found myself doing a 360.
i'm only 30, i was 27 when i had my son. i've made no secret of the fact becoming a parent was the biggest challenge i've ever known, especially the first year. a diagnosis of post natal depression and anxiety followed a very tough year both emotionally and mentally. things were so difficult the very mention of another child brought a raft of emotions i couldn't handle.
to add complications to the matter i am a carrier of a genetic condition called haemophilia. my maternal grandfather was a sufferer, my mum a carrier and i discovered aged 19 that i too was a carrier.
it was something that didn't really have a huge effect on my life until i fell pregnant at 26. i'd long known about the haemophilia since childhood as my grandfather was in and out of hospital, always having blood transfusions and complications.
i felt well researched when i found out i was pregnant, of course the haemophilia was a concern, knowing that if i was carrying a boy there was a 50/50 chance he would inherit haemophilia, but i tried not to let it overshadow my pregnancy too much.
when i gave birth to my son in 2013, he was taken for testing when he was only hours old. the following day the results came back, he didn't suffer from haemophilia. the relief was palpable. seeing him in his cot next to my bed in hospital with a huge bandage on his little hand, following his blood test, reminded me just how lucky we'd been.
i've previously written about being an only child. it never bothered me. i never knew any different. my mum had me at 32, my dad was 42. age played a part in her decision to have no more children, however, the overriding reason was the haemophilia. she felt she had 'dodged a bullet' having a girl (back then it was believed only males could suffer from haemophilia) and didn't want to push her luck any further. in actual fact, we have since discovered that females too can suffer from haemophilia, however, it is very rare for this to occur.
so, taking the haemophilia and the depression and anxiety into account, this goes some way to explain why we decided to stick with just the one child.
just before christmas one of my best friends had a beautiful baby girl. this shifted something for me. it unearthed a feeling of broodiness i hadn't experienced for a few years.
i began to have very vivid dreams of having another baby. these dreams would play on my mind for days after.
then yesterday i was in a coffee shop with my mum, grandmother and son. there was the cutest 16 month old little girl in there, she was such a happy little thing. completely taken by my son, who being the attention seeker he is, did his utmost to make her laugh. watching him interact with her made my heart swell a little bit.
i turned to my mum and said, i think i want another baby.
she did an eye roll. she's totally used to my 'hair brain ideas' as she would probably refer to them and knows how often i change my mind on things. but she indulged me and we struck up a conversation.
i think you're forgetting about the haemophilia she said. and i had.
i thought wes was getting a vasectomy? she said. and he was.
however, all of a sudden something was telling me that a permanent contraception method felt too extreme. the thought of never experiencing having another baby made me feel a little sad.
i've often said i felt like i missed out a little on my son's first year, i didn't enjoy it as i was consumed with anxiety which ultimately led to depression. that saddens me deeply and as selfish as it may sound, i want to experience it again. i want the chance to properly enjoy it.
it played on my mind for the rest of the day, so much so when i got home that night i decided to broach the subject with my partner. he admitted, as he had before, that it's the haemophilia that deters him from wanting to expand our family. we were very lucky having a baby boy who didn't have the condition, would luck strike twice?
we had a discussion and have come to the conclusion that any talk of vasectomies and sterilization is very much on the backburner. we're going to revisit the situation in a year or two and have 'the conversation' then. in the meantime, i'd be keen for us to go down the genetic counseling route. i've had an element of genetic counseling before and feel it would be beneficial for us both to try this method prior to making any definitive decisions regarding adding to our family.
i don't want to reach 40 and regret not having another baby. i hate what if's and maybe's, life is too short for that.
how can couples avoid the pitfalls that prevent the success of a second marriage? the key ingredients to a successful remarriage are selecting a partner who is a good match for you and both partners willingness to work through the inevitable hard times of marriage. with courage and persistence, you can defy the statistics that say your second marriage is doomed to fail and enjoy long-lasting love.
it's normal to feel disillusioned about marriage if you've endured a divorce and gone through emotional pain and perhaps some financial loss. then there's the available census data telling us that second marriages have a 65% divorce rate compared to 50% for first time marriages.
but in spite of these facts, you might decide that you're up for the challenge that comes with a second marriage. however, it's key to pause and examine what went wrong in your first marriage – and create a vision for a successful second one.
janette put it like this i've learned that marriage is a work in progress and that you get out of it what you put in. i feel very connected with my husband and we're working hard at keeping that connection.
janette and todd have been remarried for seventeen years and each have two children (now grown) from their first marriages. it wasn't always easy to blend their four children and they dealt with rivalries between their children. todd's daughter never really warmed up to janette and rarely visits them.
truth be told, working as a team and creating a second marriage built on a foundation of tolerance, respect, and dedication to each other are essential to a lifetime of love. todd says we are a team and work together for the happiness of the entire family. we have mutual respect for each other and we know that we will be there for each other through all of the ups and downs.
create a new vision for your remarriage
creating a positive vision for remarriage is an important first step to making your second marriage a success. everyone has baggage that can cause them to sabotage a new relationship if they haven't healed and worked through the issues that contributed to the demise of their first marriage.
add to that baggage from your first marriage is the realization that there are often a lot more players in a second marriage, such as kids from former spouses, stepkids and sometimes even new kids from this union.
taking your time to decide the kind of marriage that would work for you can be a silver lining to divorce because you'll be more likely to go into your second marriage with realistic expectations. and the fact of the matter is that you can create a happy second marriage if you give yourself permission to be vulnerable and take risks.
10 reasons second marriages are better:
you have a clearer vision about what you want from a relationship. divorce has taught you what relationship dynamic promotes your best self. a second marriage is an opportunity to approach commitment with your eyes wide open.
you are making a decision based on strength and choice rather than fear of being alone. for instance, you may have felt a nagging doubt about tying the knot with your ex-spouse, but proceeded anyway due to feelings of obligation or fear of being alone.
you've learned to take responsibility for your part in the conflict or dispute. one person's ability to do this can change the dynamic of the relationship. drs. julie and john gottman write: one person's response will literally change the brain waves of the other person. apologize to your partner when appropriate. this will validate their feelings and promote forgiveness and allow you both to move on. love is not enough. saying you're sorry can heal a wound even when you didn't hurt your partner's feelings intentionally. resentment builds over time if couples aren't able to talk about hurt feelings that arise from unresolved grievances.
you are smarter about love. since you've learned from the past, you're less likely to repeat it. and you've learned to separate the past from the present and have begun to live in the present. therapy and/or keeping a journal can help you achieve these objectives.
you can allow yourself to take risks and be vulnerable with your partner. healthy relationships don't come without risk – so you freely extend to trust to your partner by expressing your thoughts, feelings, and wishes. since you no longer have to walk on eggshells, you feel more relaxed on a daily basis.
you've learned the value of having realistic expectations about a spouse. your partner is not going to change. in other words, you can't change a cat into a dog. love just isn't enough to significantly alter a person's basic nature and upbringing. for instance, if you fall in love with someone who is reserved and you need outward signs of affection to feel secure, you'll feel chronically dissatisfied. most likely, these differences will probably erode loving feelings over time and diminish positive interactions in your relationship.
rather than trying to fix' your partner, you focus on improving your own life. many individuals focus on changing their partner and avoid dealing with their own issues. rather than investing your energy into fixing your partner, you've made a commitment to improve some of your undesirable traits – since we're all flawed in some way.
you've learned to communicate honestly about key issues in your relationship. sweeping things under the rug usually doesn't reap good results. in your second marriage, you make sure to be forthcoming about your concerns and express thoughts, feelings, and wishes in a respectful way. challenging your beliefs and self-defeating thoughts help you to let go of hurt feelings. when we listen to our partner's side of the story and process it briefly with them, we no longer need to hold onto hurt feelings.
you practice forgiveness on a daily basis. as a result, you apologize to your partner when appropriate and accept his or her apologies. this validates their feelings and promotes good will. forgiveness is not the same as condoning the hurt done to you but it will allow you to move on.
you're confident about your choice in a partner and your desire for a life partner comes from a place of strength rather than neediness. you've discovered that marriage will never be your sole source of happiness so you pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. however, you're dedicated to your partner and have an optimistic long-term view of your marriage.
the best way to beat the odds and see your remarriage succeed is to risk being vulnerable with your partner and create a positive vision for your second marriage. determination, respect, acceptance, and tolerance will greatly improve your chances of success in a second marriage.
it is a curious thing, the death of a loved one. we all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up underneath some sheet, never to wake up. and yet it is always a surprise when it happens to someone we know. -lemony snicket, horseradish: bitter truths you can't avoid
a few weeks ago, my mother's maternal aunt---my 98 year-old great-aunt sara---came down with pneumonia, became disoriented, and was admitted to the hospital. and i saw what dying looks like.
when i walked into the hospital room the first time, aunt sara--frail and bone-thin--was moaning in pain while her children and grandkids sat all around her and tried to make her comfortable. and i was immediately struck by how both ugly and intimate death seemed to be. her sallow face and bony chest and missing teeth. different hands taking turns holding onto her. the shrill, bird-like noises that came out of her as she asked repeatedly for something to drink, only to push it away whenever anyone brought one to her mouth. the not quite knowing what she wanted--thinking something would help only to realize that it didn't.
that disorientation that life is full of, death is full of too.
growing up, whenever my sisters or i would have an overly dramatic reaction to something--a loud gasp or high-octane oh my god--we'd say to each other: whoa, you just aunt sara-ed that one. of course, my sisters and i were just engaging in adolescent drama--- spilled milk and all. but for aunt sara, those audible reactions---sometimes heart-attack-level sounds for skinned-knee situations---came from a primal place of genuine concern. she just loved everyone around her too damn much, and didn't like to hear about bad things happening to them. and so, in my family, aunt sara became a verb.
i'm smart enough to know that i don't have anything original to say about death. it just is, waiting for every one of us. and seeing aunt sara's whole life crowded into that small, hospital room with blank walls and padded chairs and lcd screens displaying all the information her body was giving away--i didn't know what to think. i wanted it to have this immediate, revelatory effect on me. wanted it to teach me something profound about life. but the truth is, i walked away from all of it with, as tim o'brien said in if i die in a combat zone, just a few simple, unprofound scraps of truth: life is short. family is important. seize the day. nothing is permanent.
i often forget how impermanent it all is. well, not so much forget as much as allow all the things in my life to crowd out that knowledge: deciding whether or not to keep the kick-ass pair of winter boots that i just spent too much money on. my machinations to get to someplace warm next month for a few days. ideas about decorating my study. questions about when i'm due for my next oil change and how long it's been since i published a blog post, and has my boyfriend remembered to exchange that velvet blazer i got him for christmas.
all kinds of noises, some more stupid than others.
and it occurs to me, especially at this time of year when we're all so busy making enormous resolutions to be better and thinner and healthier, that the hardest part of things is often the middle--when you're right in the thick of it and it's so easy to get lost.
i'm sitting here in my living room in the middle of january--when mild temperatures have long since disappeared, and they are nowhere on the horizon. i'm 35, which is on its way to being some kind of midpoint. i've been writing a book for two and a half years now, and, though approaching the skeleton of a rough draft, i'm still many many cycles of revisions and rewrites away from a finished product. i'm a few years into the best relationship i've ever had. i'm in it, all of it--right in the middle of this big, messy, brilliant, baffling, surprising life of mine. and that's a hard place to be, i think.
it's a place where there are no enormous resolutions for me to make--where all there is to do is keep going. keep doing what i'm doing, keep showing up to my life. keep writing and editing and re-writing. keep caring about the kind of person i am and how i choose to treat other people. keep being honest and flawed and spoiled and selfish and scared--and keep trying to do it all with a little more grace than yesterday.
how do you keep pushing yourself when there's no big payoff right around the corner? when the end is (probably, hopefully) too far out to be either the carrot or the stick?
i find it all quite difficult, especially right after seeing a life shrunken down to its bare essentials: a woman in the middle of a hospital room with all that florescent sadness and love and fear--just asking for a drink and a little comfort on the way out. it makes me want to change everything, right now: get closer to everyone so that my hospital room will be filled with people one day; finish my manuscript tomorrow, see the world, run for days, spoil my nieces and nephew. and while those are all admirable goals--and there's nothing wrong with reaching to be better--i think the real heroics are in the grit and muscle of the daily grind. i think trying to conquer the world all at once is naive and self-defeating.
i think that if i want to honor aunt sara's memory, i just have to keep showing up, keep caring about people--and keep gasping wildly and dramatically with them when the need arises.
the streets are still coloured in many glassy lights, the parks are still filled with children with happy faces, and merry songs are still being played. no doubt,the festive season is slowly winding up and while businesses are enjoying some sort of break, some are on the clock monitoring, evaluating and strategizing new ways to rake in profit.
many have laid out plans for their new year. as 2017 slowly cruises into full gear, it is normal for individuals and brands to settle down and make preparations that are almost sure to guarantee that 2017 turns out a greater year than 2016 was.
speaking to an entrepreneur friend, it was clear that most businesses are employing some slightly new measures to improve customer experiences, services, or product delivery. perhaps some of their moves may be of use to your business.
1. online security- interestingly, many businesses, especially the small and medium, ones hardly take this particular step seriously. nowadays, businesses are careful about their internet data safety thus encrypting it. some plan to anonymize their ip addresses using various tools to improve online privacy and check security. the aim at the end of the day is to improve internal work conditions for staff.
2. workforce appreciation- businesses, no matter how small, are making plans to maximize the current workforce they have especially the millennials. truthfully, it's hard to have the perfect workforce, but with the right push, appreciation and communication, the most can be gotten from the current crop of workforce you wield.
3. never walk alone- it'll surprise you the heights your business can reach when you collaborate. new frontiers don't have to be conquered on your own. sharing skills, knowledge and experience can add immense value to the structure of your business.
4. outsource the others- we were taught the essence and benefits of division of labour. once it was said that if you want to go fast, work alone but if you want to go farther, walk in packs. businesses can always remain thought leaders in their sphere even if they outsource some services to other contractors.
5. diversify your portfolio- in the spirit of streaming in profit, it is wise to diversify and invest in as many channels as possible. in 2017, look for avenues to make more wealth than your business is currently offering.
make the right moves for your business and let the rest of the year thank you for them.
if one thing from all of this is clear, we really need to beef up our election standards and improve the system across the board.
it's just another waste of taxpayers money.
a u.k. dad's adorable photo series is documenting his son's growth, with some help from their trusty pet beagle.
for the past two years, photographer timothy jones has taken monthly photos of his son stan sitting in a chair with their 6-year-old dog jasper. jones told the huffington post the series began when stan was only 10 days old.
timothy jones for the past two years, jones has taken monthly photos of his son stan sitting in a chair with their 6-year-old dog jasper.
jasper always used to sit in the chair and chill out, and i thought it would be a good picture of the both of them in the chair. he said. when he looked at that first photo, he knew he had to make it a tradition. as you can see from the results it's been worth it! he said.
stan, who just celebrated his second birthday on new year's eve, had a viral moment in 2016 after his dad gave him a camera to document the world from his toddler perspective. jasper made an appearance in those photos, as stan and the beagle have a special relationship.
timothy jones stan and jasper get on amazingly, jones said.
they get on amazingly, jones said. jasper was a bit off at first as we basically brought home a screaming poop machine! they are now very affectionate to each other and stan loves giving him a hug and the odd kiss!
the dad said he hopes his photos of stan and jasper make people smile. it shows the great relationships that kids have with their pets, he said. it's great for us as a family, as we get to see him change in real life but we also get to capture it in these photos.
president-elect joe biden has assembled what environmentalists are calling an all-star team to lead his government's efforts to curb climate change and reverse the trump administration's astoundingly pro-polluter legacy.
rep. deb haaland (d-n.m.), one of the first two native american women elected to congress and a strong supporter of the green new deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the senate confirms her as head of the interior department. in place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the environmental protection agency would be michael regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in u.s. history as north carolina's top environmental regulator. the energy department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for jennifer granholm, michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.
with the senate likely to remain in republican hands this year, biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the obama administration's approach after democrats lost the house in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.
to oversee the effort, biden picked gina mccarthy, barack obama's former epa chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in congress.
beyond their stark ideological contrasts to president donald trump's agency heads, biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next gop president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.
there's this very calculated, hard-nosed recognition among the choices that executive action is going to be the key to progress, and action at the state level is going to be the key to progress, said cara horowitz, a climate policy expert at ucla school of law.
as the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.
but biden and vice president-elect kamala harris have options. and they've made it clear they're all on the table.
the biden-harris administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, jamal brown, a biden transition spokesman, told huffpost in an email.
carolyn kaster/associated press president-elect joe biden announces his climate and energy team nominees and appointees at the queen theater in wilmington, delaware, dec. 19.
biden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire united nations projections on global warming. in may 2019, reuters reported that biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.
unsurprisingly, climate activists and scientists revolted, with some dubbing him middle ground joe. the biden campaign dismissed the report, and biden himself defended his record as an early champion of climate action.
as the election drew closer, biden made climate a central part of his bid for the white house, tempering fears among advocates and scientists that he'd take the same slow, moderate approach that obama had during his first term a decade earlier.
obama picked ken salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. the approach relied on congress, both chambers of which democrats controlled when obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. going forward, the gop, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the supreme court's 2010 citizens united ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.
the partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the obama years have only deepened under trump, a reality that horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.
witnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.
biden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. unless democrats can somehow flip a pair of republican-held senate seats in the georgia runoff election on jan. 5, the gop will maintain control of the senate while democrats hold a slim majority in the house.
there is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. but a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th congress.
alex edelman via getty images defeating the threat of global climate change is the fight of our lifetimes, gina mccarthy said after being introduced as biden's nominee to be his national climate adviser.
biden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. in the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, biden said he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. he said he will call on congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.
in his plan, biden also vowed to use the full authority of the executive branch, beginning his first day in office, to combat global warming, including orders to limit methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, protect the arctic national wildlife refuge from oil and gas drilling and conserve 30% of america's lands and waters by 2030.
but whether he's able to forge a climate legacy that endures beyond his time in office may very well hinge on leveraging states and cities to take aggressive action.
the lesson of the trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said amy myers jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at tufts university. the biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from new england wind to stricter methane rules mirroring colorado to california's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.
myers jaffe supports a federalist model for addressing climate change, one to organize state voluntary efforts into a federally led initiative that would build a national policy without letting one or two states dictate through the courts, she said.
notably, several members of biden's environmental team have state government experience.
that's where i think the list really shines, horowitz said. he's packed this list with people who know how state progress is made.
what he can do without congress
experts say there are numerous ways for the incoming biden administration to empower states and shore up its own gains even if a republican unseats him in 2024.
biden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said michael gerrard, director of columbia law school's sabin center for climate change law.
it's challenging to achieve permanence without legislation, gerrard said. but conditions on voluntarily received financial assistance are one method.
the administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, horowitz noted.
giving states the power and funding to make progress helps to insulate progress from the seesaw of future federal policy priorities ― not perfectly, but at least somewhat, she said.
david hayes, executive director of new york university school of law's state energy & environmental impact center and a former deputy interior secretary under obama, declined to comment specifically on the incoming biden administration, but stressed the importance of federal-state collaboration.
the trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke california's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. this approach does not produce durable policy. as we've seen, many of the trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.
in his lengthy climate plan, biden slammed the trump administration for abdicating america's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. since trump announced in june 2017 that he would pull the u.s. out of the landmark paris climate agreement, 25 states, hundreds of cities and thousands of businesses and other entities have pledged their commitment to the goals of the international accord.
these states and cities deserve to once again have a partner in the white house, the biden plan reads. biden will be that partner.
this story has been updated with additional details about biden's 2020 presidential run.
lonely george, a beloved hawaiian tree snail that was the last known member of its entire species, died at the age of 14, state wildlife officials said.
the brown and white snail was the sole survivor of the achatinella apexfulva species, a type of invertebrate that once flourished across the tropical islands and was known as the jewels of the forest, according to hawaii's snail extinction prevention program.
hawaii's department of land and natural resources highlighted the snail as an ambassador for the plight of the hawaiian land snails in an obituary confirming its new year's day death.
he was featured in many newspaper, magazine and online articles, and hundreds of school children and visitors to the lab eagerly viewed him, the last of his kind, the department wrote last week.
scientists and environmentalists have fought the destruction of the tree snails' habitat and the increase of invasive predators, both of which are blamed for the snails' death.
in 2012, lonely george was taken to the university of hawaii among 10 of the last known achatinella apexfulva snails. there, the snail outlived all of its gastropod companions, leaving it unable to mate with another snail of its kind, according to the hawaii department of land and natural resources.
george matured in a cage by himself, and although we called him a 'he,' the snail was a hermaphrodite, having both male and female parts, the department wrote. unfortunately, achatinella apexfulva seem to have been an obligate outcrossing species, meaning that it needed a partner to reproduce.
lonely george was named after lonesome george, the famous pinta island tortoise who was the last of his species before his death in the galapagos islands in 2012.
hawaii dlnr lonely george, the last known tree snail of its species, has died in hawaii, wildlife officials announced.
in 2017, scientists collected a two-millimeter snippet of george's foot and sent it to san diego's frozen zoo, where the living tissue sample remains frozen. this preservation offers the chance that in the future, the snail could be cloned and allowed to live again, if technology allows.
the snail extinction prevention program, which is part of hawaii's forestry and wildlife division, is working to protect the islands' tree snails from meeting a fate similar to lonely george's.
the islands once boasted more than 750 species of terrestrial snails, but more than 90 percent of the diversity has since been lost, according to the program's website.
university of hawaii professor emeritus michael hadfield, who ran a conservation lab for snails of the achatinella genus, told cnn that despite scientists' efforts, the future of lonely george's genus also looks bleak.
there's no doubt that only 10 or so of those (species) still exist, and none of them will survive in the next 10 years, hadfield said. the extinctions have just been horrendous.
the hawaii department of land and natural resources similarly cautioned that lonely george's death is likely just the beginning.
sadly, his passing is also a harbinger of what's to come for our remaining kāhuli (tree snails) if more is not done quickly to protect them from invasive species and climate change, the department wrote. many of the island's remaining land snails are facing imminent extinction.
it's the love/hate relationship for the ages - marketing and sales. marketing needs sales to clearly explain what they need to draw in customers and sales needs marketing to help fill the pipeline with prospects. let's face it, sometimes things get ugly in the process - in the tech industry, it's so critical for marketing and sales to operate seamlessly.
allan thompson, chief operating officer at nsfocus, a global provider of intelligent hybrid security solutions, has seen the marketing/sales relationship from all sides. nsfocus is a cybersecurity company that focuses on network security - a hot space, with a lot of heavyweight competition. the company was founded in 2000, in china - and allan's job is to lead global expansion. although he's currently coo, allan's background is in sales, business development and marketing - basically he's seen it all, and has some great advice on marketing/sales alignment and what it takes to build a strong team.
what is your background and current role at nsfocus?
i am chief operating officer with the charter to expand nsfocus to all parts of the world outside china. i have been in the cybersecurity market for 20 years now, building leading companies like trend micro, intruvert networks (acquired by mcafee), reconnex (acquired by mcafee), redseal and now nsfocus. my knowledge and expertise is in marketing to the enterprise, service provider and federal markets via global channel and direct sales. i have spent most of my career in executive roles leading global marketing, sales and business development - that experience gave me the background that i need to run nsfocus ib.
what's your proudest 'marketing moment' at nsfocus?
the company had been in the global market place for 9 years with nominal success and awareness. i knew that in order to be competitive it was critical to reinvent our messaging - to really communicate our breadth of services and value in a competitive market. i'm most proud of creating our unique intelligent hybrid security positioning. we've backed up our new messaging with customer success stories and data that supports our leadership in the market - and it's really helped to support and drive global sales.
as a member of the c-suite, when it comes to marketing and communication activities - what does success mean to you?
success is measured in short term and long term impact to the global pipeline - it means driving a global pr message so that prospects and partners can very clearly understand our value and advantages over the 1000+ security vendors that are currently in market.
what types of metrics are most valuable to demonstrating impact to execs?
we track increases in volume of hits to our website and how many documents are downloaded per month. we also track the increase of subscribers to our webinar series program, attendance at global events, monthly pr achievements - but most importantly we look for a 25% contribution to the global pipeline on a monthly basis.
in your opinion, what are the 3 biggest challenges that marketers face in the cybersecurity space?
1. the competition: it's so important that prospects understand how your solutions solve their specific problems - and how your technology is valuable and different from other vendors.
2. sales messaging: global channel partners and the sales team must be able to communicate value in its simplest form to ensure that prospects understand, why nsfocus?.
3. marketing and public relations: you need to make sure that your technology is seen in multiple press and pr settings to build reputation and awareness, so that prospects and decision making teams are clear on the company's market position and solution set.
in the tech industry - what does sales need from marketing?
sales needs simple and effective sales tools and programs to convey value. all prospects review hundreds of data sheets, presentations, white papers, channel hot sheets etc. what they want is simple and clear materials - so they can quickly understand the value of your solutions. the more complicated they are the less likely the vendor will be selected. marketing materials should be professionally designed - but they also must effectively convey who you are, why you are different and the 3 key value propositions of your solution set.
how can marketing/sales alignment be improved?
it's the job of marketing and sales to work together to create consistent and clear messaging - at a global scale. it is critical that a brand's value and solutions can be easily conveyed, internally and externally. if a prospect on the it decision making team can't explain what the security vendor does and why - then you are unlikely to be selected or remembered.
what are the qualities of a strong marketing department?
marketers must be great listeners; they must adhere to the advice from analysts, press, pr agencies, prospects, customers, sales people, product management etc. great teams understand how to listen, and then return the message worldwide so all parties understand the company and its solutions. if a company's value is understood by all relevant audiences, then the marketing team is doing a great job.
what are the most important traits that you look for when you're hiring marketing and comms professionals, internally and externally (e.g. agencies)?
passion, creativity, the ability to listen to all parties, flexibility to alter or change effectively to ensure the message stays crisp and fresh and alignment with business and sales objectives.
what's on the horizon for nsfocus?
nsfocus will be launching global case studies on the value of deploying our intelligent hybrid security solutions and our global threat intelligence platform, which includes the first and only view of attacks to and from china representing 40% of global attacks. we'll also be making some key announcements prior to rsa 2017 in san francisco, ca.

kevin hart made another attempt to apologize to the lgbtq community on monday after several previous efforts to distance himself from past homophobic comments he made.
during a monday afternoon episode of siriusxm's straight from the hart, the comedian said he apologized for remarks that hurt members of the lgbtq community that came to light in december after he was selected to host the 2019 academy awards.
we thought it was ok to talk like that, because that's how we talked to one another, hart said of comments he made as recently as 2011, abc reported. this is wrong now. because now we're in a space where i'm around people of the lgbtq community, and i'm now aware of how these words make them feel, and why they say 'that s**t hurt because of what i've been through.'
hart also said he was on the side of equality but that it's important for people to have their own personal beliefs.
in the fight for equality, that means that there has to be an acceptance for change, he said.
the comedian continued: if you don't want to accept people for their change, then where are you trying to get to the equal part? where does the equality part come in? i don't think it's wrong for people to have their own personal beliefs. i think that in the times that we're living in, we have to be understanding and accepting of people and change. bottom line.
hart's comments come just days after he appeared on the ellen degeneres show and received a strong endorsement from the talk show host.
degeneres said that as a gay person, she had been sensitive to the comedian's homophobic remarks but believed he had grown.
hart stepped down as the academy award's host just two days after being awarded the gig, following scrutiny over past tweets and comments he made that used homophobic language. after some delay, the comedian eventually tweeted an apologetic explanation.
many found his apologies lacking, but degeneres said she accepted hart's remorse wholesale and revealed she had called the academy of motion picture arts and sciences asking for the comedian to be given back the hosting gig.
cnn anchor don lemon, who is gay, later urged hart to focus on being an ally instead of trying to wipe the slate clean with an apology.
apologizing and moving on does not make the world a better place for people who are gay or people who are transgender, lemon said. being an ally does.
i can remember it like it was yesterday. it was a hot, thursday night and i was catching up on tmz, one of my favorite shows. i had class in the morning and knew i should have been getting ready for bed when the next segment caught my eye. the story was about maya henry, a girl younger than me from texas, who just had a $6 million dollar quincenera (a traditional mexican coming-of-age party for girls, similar to bat mitzvahs). hundreds of people showed up to the venue, which was custom built just for her party. there were cherry trees taller than anything i've ever seen before, floral decorations and arrangements everywhere, making the space look like a scene from the secret garden. the inside of the party was just as fabulous, with butterflies hanging from the ceiling, and more floral arrangements cascading the space like arches. she also got the chance to wear not one, but two beautiful gowns, which contributed to almost half a million dollars. both dresses exemplified elegance and grace, and honestly, it felt like something straight out of a princess fairytale from the 21st century. i was so fascinated by this girl and her life, and before i knew it, i had drifted into slumber, the voices in the background still telling maya's story.
the next thing i knew; i was at the cfda fashion awards in new york. i don't remember how i got here, or how i was invited but i'm with maya henry! she's wearing an absolutely gorgeous etro dress with floral print cascading all the way down to her ankles. her shoes are gorgeous, and everyone is gorgeous. we talk, and that's when i realize that me and maya are bffs! we make our way around the star-studded event, having casual conversations with anna wintour, heidi klum and laverne cox. i hear maya talk about her work with the hillary campaign, and the #teensforhillary she started to raise awareness about the presidential campaign, and her passion for philanthropic work with children. it was all so surreal, and while i felt like a true fish out of water, it was comforting to know i was with one of my best friends. i remember fast-forwarding a bit to our own little shopping trip. we were in los angeles, looking for dresses to wear to george clooney's dinner party later that night. we spent hours laughing and hanging out; it was a normal weekend being maya henry's friend. it was... it was a dream! it was all a dream, and i woke up to the sound of my alarm irritatingly reminding me that i had class in a bit.
as i was getting myself together, disappointed that none of it would ever be my reality, i got a phone call from a texas number. could it be? omg! it was maya henry herself, calling me! i knew i had to tell her everything, so i told her about my dream, about our jet-setting adventures and low key fabulous weekends in california. i also knew i had to ask her about current events since we just finished a major election, so i figured i'd pick her brain a bit on everything going on
jazz girard: 2016 was such an amazing year for you; how do you plan on keeping that momentum in 2017?
maya henry: 2016 was an amazing year for me! i never expected my life to change so drastically in just one year. i have been given so many opportunities and i'm so excited for what the new year has to offer. i have a lot of projects i'm working on that include acting and modeling. i have been taking acting classes and going on auditions. i i will continue with acting because it is something i am very passionate about. i will also continue to develop my modeling careers not only as a model but as a role model to all young teens. my biggest project for 2017 will be my philanthropy work.
jg: how do you feel about our president-elect, both as a millennial and as a latina with strong mexican heritage? what do you think that this means for the united states moving forward?
mh: it is clear that a majority of our country supported a woman for president. even though our electoral college doesn't not allow for the majority to win, people did voice their opinion and were willing to have a female president. i am happy that people were able to demonstrate that a woman can truly have the most powerful position in the world. i have friends and family that have supported both sides and i believe we all need to do what we can to make our country the best it can be. if our current president can't make our country better than it already is, then when i am of voting age i will be able to have a true voice for change through my vote! as a young latina woman, i encourage everyone to fight for our rights. i think that no matter our religion, race, gender, or sexuality--we all have equal rights!
jg: how do you plan on using your philanthropic passion and political motivation to help people of your generation and beyond?
mh: as a young teenage woman, i understand what a great opportunity i have to help young people in my generation that do not have the same opportunities as i. i have had the fortune of meeting some amazing people that have the same goals as i do, and who can assist me in working together to ensure that we help other young people in need, as well as encouraging young people to stay educated and involved.
maya's rise to internet popularity through her epic quincenera party has no match on her future potential as a rising star, philanthropic leader, and political correspondent. be sure to look out for her in years to come!
be sure to follow maya henry on instagram to keep up with her!
community equals immunity. something good happens to your primordial grid when you're spending time with like-minded folks. knowledge is shared. inspiration is gifted. new seeds are planted.
i attended my first hay house i can do it conference in nyc a few weeks ago and got to experience the resonance first-hand. the collagen of consciousness literally rebuilds our bodies. an idea grows stronger when it is shared, a course in miracles reminds us; may the nuggets below galvanize you to step into your highest self. happy new year!
change your thoughts, change your life
dr. wayne dyer attended in spirit and his teaching rang truer than ever. my key take-away is his phrase, when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. that's all you need.
listening to and honoring our inner artist is close to cheryl richardson's heart. she takes singing lessons just for the pleasure of it because it's part of the expression of her soul. that's radical self-care. stand up for your gifts because the world needs artists and healers. and remember, cheryl says, when you ask the universe to support you, take action when it does. now go out and kick some ass.
la diosa northrup rocked the house with her trailblazing message that aging, commonly defined as a loss of life force, is optional. what a concept! it takes a supportive community to develop the collagen of courage to go beyond the pale. redefine what it means to be advanced in years; drop age (because it's a cage); and realize that you're in charge of creating your best life. more here and here and here. and remember: there is no death, and your job is to live while you're here. and to have flexible hamstrings.
the inimitable dr. bruce lipton gave a fabulously engaging and enlightening talk on the power of epigenetics. our lifestyle choices determine which genes are turned on and off. simple as that. and who controls your lifestyle? that's right, you! the notion that you're a victim of your genes and predestined to a certain dis-ease because it runs in your family is old news. the reason certain issues are being displayed by several generations is because they're sharing the same lifestyle (i.e., junk food, smoking, lack of exercise, negative thoughts). as dr. bruce says, you are the master of your genes. and lifestyle comes down to energy. you are a tuning fork. your thoughts are energy vibration. what energy are you sending out? you feng shui yourself.
leave it to gabby bernstein to fuse spiritual principles with supreme practicality. sharing stories from her own life on the power of forgiveness, she reinforced on stage what we know in our hearts: lean towards joy and you will be led. joy is freedom. joy is the movement. joy is the creator. yes, there's a time for anger, sadness, and grief. that's human, natural, and necessary. but thriving happens elsewhere. it's where we're committed to love, open to the beauty of the world, and enthused with the light of life. en-theos translates into god within, and that's where the magic happens. our greatest power is our capacity to tune in to the cosmos. amen.
dr. barbara de angelis closed out the event with a powerful talk on how to truly transform. transformation is shifting how you're vibrating, she says. you're a vibrational offering to the world. that's the gem right there. realize you're always vibrating, always giving off energies. in order to uplift yourself, your loved ones, and our beautiful planet, we need to raise our vibrations. love, peace, joy, kindness, compassion, and gratitude are high-vibe thoughts that translate directly into luminous life experiences. how're you choosing to vibrate today?
i met up with executive chef andrew roenbeck in the garden room of the italian restaurant lucca at the boca raton resort & club. gregarious and friendly, andrew is a strong presence at the resort, having worked there for 26 years, first starting out as executive sous chef for 14 years before taking over as the executive chef. he oversees 178 cooks, 65 stewards and 15 area chefs at the 13 restaurants located throughout the resort, club and clubhouse.
andrew attributes his job tenure to the specialness of the resort. the longevity of the team here is abnormally long because it's such a dynamic place. there is flashy, newer competition out there, but they don't have what this resort has. our guests and members and convention attendees are well-traveled, understand quality very quickly, and their expectation is high. so our job is to make sure that, even though we are a historic property, we are staying ahead of what the current trends are but weighing that against being too flashy.
he doesn't have a typical day but his job goes beyond what the job title suggests. the reason why i can stay here as long as i have is because, truly, each week and each day there is something new. when you are dealing with that many associates, it's kind of like working at the united nations. if you name the nationality, personality or temperament, we have it. you have to be as much of a chef as you do a financial planner, a guidance counselor, even a pastor at times. it's amazing what comes across the chef's plate here and to keep all the moving parts moving is unique.
andrew has had many mentors during his career to prepare him for this role, including steven hall who ultimately convinced him to come to the resort. his job is very detail oriented, and there is a lot of precision that goes into creating what he calls the boca twist. one example he gives is something he learned from mentor kelly vohs, who taught him that a restaurant has to have something called melt. it's music, entertainment, lighting, temperature. if one of those is off, you don't feel comfortable in the space and you won't want to go back to it, even if you don't know why. as an owner, you have to ask yourself if one of those things is off. so when we look at a restaurant, we want to make sure, before we open a restaurant, is the music and volume correct, is the temperature correct and does it need be adjusted throughout the night.
andrew credits the resort with changing to keep up with the current times, yet keeping the strong traditions. he strongly believes in the individuality of each restaurant at the resort. every restaurant needs to swim in its own lane; there can't be crossover. i don't care if we have a number one selling dish - what you don't do is drop that dish into every menu at the resort. the menus change seasonally, four times a year, as do the drink menus. they source the food, whenever possible, using local farms for produce, including hydroponic farm swank specialty produce, and four local fisherman to bring in the fish daily, and seagrille offers a list of today's catch of fresh fish which changes on a daily basis. the resort also obtain a good portion of their kobe wagyu beef from nearby jackman ranch, located in florida, that raises its cattle free of hormones and antibiotics. regarding the unique drink menu, andrew comments that, eric hammer moved specifically into the director of beverage role a year and a half ago because we wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the current trendy drinks, and the creativity that comes with that.
lunch options are equally important to andrew as they average 1500 lunches on the pool deck in three hours. he underscores that, even at lunch, presentation is key, with the chopped salads being served in two oversized martini shakers (one upside down on top of the other), and entrees being served in stackable beach-boxes that were custom-made for the resort.
i ask andrew to name a signature dish at lucca. one item that has been on the menu since day one, and we cannot take it off the menu or we are probably going to have a riot at the door, is the scallops piccata. it has a caramelized spaghetti sauce with sage and capers and golden raisins, and our beautiful scallops go on top. any family recipes? 'my mother's potato salad  he says with a laugh, sharing that he often goes into the walk-in refrigerator to sample the daily prepared salad and make sure that it stays spot-on.
in terms of the best part of his job, i love a good challenge. i love when we have events that are creative partners with us. when they are looking for the next, best great thing, and we can work within their budget to execute that in the event space or within the restaurants. you have to wear so many hats at a large property like this, you are constantly on the move. as kelly vohs would say, 'btty'. better today than yesterday.
as my mother and nana tell it, the first word i ever read was macy's. i was just shy of 2 and read it off of someone's shopping bag at a mall in new jersey, where we spent most winter saturdays in my childhood. my grandma on my dad's side operated a clothing store out of her home in brooklyn for years. my parents were set up by those two grandmothers after they kept bumping into each other at ― you guessed it ― the wholesale clothing store they both shopped in seasonally. one grandma was shopping for her store, the other was shopping (likely just as abundantly) for herself.
i guess you could say that shopping, clothing, and collecting stuff is in my blood. in many ways, it's the glue that bonds the three women in my family together. the joy of shopping is something we, three people from three generations with different understandings of the world, can agree on. my mom taught me how to spot a good sale, my nana taught me how to dress. i've brought her to a fashion show, i've let her dress me in the name of journalism, but most importantly i've always associated the mere act of shopping as happy, soothing and positive.
my home, a decent yet still new york city-sized studio, is a reflection of the way i've been raised. when i walked into what's now my apartment for the first time, i put in an offer based on the closet alone: a holy walk-through with built-in storage installed by the previous owner. i already had a lot of stuff, and this was the first apartment i'd seen that seemed to both be within my budget and able to fit everything i'd acquired.
that was five years ago, when i had less credit card debt, about 100 percent fewer tote bags i never use, and considerably less closet-crowding than i have now. when i looked around at the closet that once felt like a dream and now reminded me more of a nightmare, i realized something needed to change.
marie kondo has been on my radar since 2014, when everyone and their mother started reading her bestselling book and figuring out if their possessions brought them joy. i tried to figure it out myself, years ago, and quickly found reasons that everything ― including socks with no mate (they'll come up in the next load of laundry!) brought me so-called joy in some way. i promptly abandoned the project of tidying up.
four years after her first book's release, kondo's new netflix show, tidying up with marie kondo, brings the magic of her tidying up principles to life ― pushing the agenda that clutter and mess lead to stress, and a minimalistic approach ultimately can lead to a more joyful and fulfilled life. research shows the link between mess and stress, as well as the health benefits of having a tidy home. a 2010 study found that women who had cluttered homes expressed higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, than those who didn't, according to psychology today.
the netflix series follows kondo to various homes in various states of mess. she imparts her wisdom, folding principles and soothing demeanor on couples and families in hopes of bringing more joy to their lives. in one episode, a couple learns to appreciate each other without clutter getting in the way. in another, a pair of empty-nesters learn how to make their home theirs again.
perhaps my rekindled urge to purge has to do not only with the show being a delight on the senses, but also a commitment i've recently made to make my apartment more of a place i want to spend time in. it seems obvious, but as a messy person with anxiety, it took the help of a therapist to realize how stressful coming home to a place in disarray truly is. (i know i've evolved because i asked for a vacuum cleaner for the holidays this year.)
but the cluttered closet, which became my first thought in the morning (i have to walk through it to get to the bathroom) and my last thought at night, had long weighed on me like the pile of dry cleaning stuffed into one of the shelves.
when things stopped fitting on the hangers, i got creative (read: messier).
because my first attempt at the kon-mari method didn't stick, i asked a friend to help me sift through the stress stuff ― something i highly recommend to anyone starting on this journey without the assistance of kondo herself. ideally, it will be someone who lives more minimally than you and who is not as attached to the coverup you wore at bonnaroo 2009 as you are.
we did not exactly seek joy out of each piece as we made our way through the closet. instead, we developed our own criteria, where my friend asked me of every item: does this make you feel good? do you feel sexy wearing this? many times, the answer was no. i felt pangs of guilt as i said no to dresses my grandmother had purchased for me, t-shirts my mother had brought me from various travels around the country (if you're reading this, sorry mom) and things i spent good money on that i thought i would love forever but in reality stopped wearing a long time ago.
in the end, i axed about 70 percent of my wardrobe, shoes included. don't get me wrong. me saying i have no clothes is like your friend with hair down to her butt getting a trim and lamenting that she has no hair. however, i can claim one entirely empty dresser and several newly sparse shelves. i can see everything in my closet. there's a nice surplus of hangers that now sit on a top shelf just in case, and i uncovered a favorite bra i thought was lost and gone forever nestled safely at the top of the underwear drawer.
can you spot the dress that now has a home?
my first instinct after emptying the closet was, of course, to fill it again. what was i going to do with all that space? but the thought dissipated when i realized how calm and serene the less-crowded closet has made me. i find myself just standing in there sometimes ― like a less-anxious weirdo.
tidying up didn't just give me more literal space, but something deeper. i have always used clothing and shopping as a distraction, a way to fill a void and feel self-sufficient. there's a part of me that feels like i filled up every nook and cranny to convince myself that only i could fit here ― that there was no space for another person, with all their literal and figurative stuff. now i'm starting to think i might be able to share.
empty shelves -- never thought i'd see the likes of those.
in 2019, i'll be spending more time in my tidy, sparse(r) apartment, and, in an effort to keep up this joyous momentum, have vowed to take a break from shopping and a commitment to buying only vintage when i do shop. not only is the stuff better, it's better on the wallet, and the environment. and that, well, brings me joy.
i highly recommend the practice for you, too. just don't forget about that friend ― and maybe try to forget about bonnaroo.
time is up, she told e! correspondent giuliana rancic. we want diversity, we want intersectional gender parity [and] we want equal pay.
i was so shocked to hear that e! doesn't believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host, the will and grace star added. i miss catt sadler. so we stand with her. and that's something that can change tomorrow. we want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.
sadler announced her departure from e! news on her website late last month, explaining that she quit after discovering kennedy had been making nearly double her salary for years.
a sweeping reform bill that house democrats say will be their first priority after ending the partial government shutdown is filled with policies that would fundamentally alter the nation's voting and campaign finance systems. these policies are not coming out of nowhere. most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country.
within the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level, said rep. john sarbanes (d-md.), the bill's chief sponsor. it's not a unicorn. it's not like we're talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of jupiter. this is happening in america.
supreme court justice louis brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. this laboratories of democracy concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.
that is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in democrats' h.r. 1, which they're calling the for the people act. the bill's campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. the same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
saul loeb via getty images house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) speaks alongside democratic lawmakers about h.r. 1, the for the people act, at the capitol in washington, d.c., on jan. 4.
since 2015, 15 states and the district of columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the united states.
the policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: when someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. if they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.
oregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. while it's still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. the policy went into effect in january 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. a 2017 analysis from the left-leaning center for american progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldn't have otherwise registered.
automatic voter registration also went into effect in california last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in april and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (there were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of october.) the program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the dmv made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. the head of the dmv resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.
automatic restoration of voting rights for people with felony convictions
associated press former felons desmond meade, president of the florida rights restoration coalition, left, and david ayala, husband of state attorney aramis ayala, celebrate with copies of their voter registration forms after voters approved an initiative restoring voting rights to ex-felons in november.
forty-eight states don't allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. some states allow former felons to vote once they're released from prison, while others bar them while they're on probation or parole. the various policies can be extremely confusing and deter people from registering to vote, even if they're eligible.
the for the people act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. currently, 13 states and the district of columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved.
i think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful, said sean morales-doyle, counsel at the brennan center for justice, a new york-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights. having a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. it would also clear up confusion among elections officials. it would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier.
the supreme court's 2010 citizens united decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. congress attempted to fix the court's collateral damage to transparency with the disclose act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a republican filibuster in the senate.
states have since stepped in to pass their own disclose acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the supreme court have been adopted in california, delaware, montana, new york, texas, vermont and washington. some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help congress determine the best option for federal elections.
california's disclose act is great but limited, said former federal election commission chairwoman ann ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit maplight.
the california government has enacted two disclosure bills since the citizens united decision. the first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. the second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower ― which is something the house democrats' bill does.
associated press seattle city council member teresa mosqueda was the first person in the country to win an elected office by collecting democracy vouchers to fund her campaign.
a little-noticed provision in democrats' big reform bill would create a pilot program for democracy vouchers ― a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. these vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.
the democracy vouchers idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor bruce ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. the program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. one study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city's 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.
the vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.
in 2017, seattle city council candidate teresa mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. she had kept hearing that she should run for city council from participants in a program she ran for the afl-cio that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. she was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a latina in the labor movement who didn't come from money. but her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign ― until seattle's democracy vouchers became available.
the democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time, mosqueda said.
i was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government, she added.
the pilot program in the democrats' bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.
the for the people act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before election day. it would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.
twenty states and the district of columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. it's seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.
early voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between republicans and democrats over voting laws. the conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits democrats, so republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. but one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the university of wisconsin-madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. the authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while election day registration tends to benefit democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit republicans.
the type of voter who takes advantage of early voting ― older, whiter, and wealthier ― is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote republican, the authors wrote in a blog post last year. our findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. the availability of early voting in isolation raises the republican vote by about six percentage points.
when same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.
h.r. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. state lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. in 2011, republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. they executed that plan extremely precisely and well.
six states ― alaska, arizona, california, idaho, montana and washington ― use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (voters in michigan, utah and colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the november election.) advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.
when lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters. kathay feng, national redistricting director at common cause
in 2011, california's independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission ― which is made up of five democrats, five republicans and four people not affiliated with either party ― but there are strict requirements on who can serve. eligible applicants must be registered to vote in california and have voted in two of the last three elections. in the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can't have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. votes from multiple democrats, republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. h.r. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.
when lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don't have to face serious competition for the next 10 years, said kathay feng, national redistricting director at the good government group common cause, which championed the creation of california's commission.
the for the people act's main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. it is based on the decades-old public financing program run for new york city elections.
new york adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. at the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. a candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. but the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.
proponents of new york city's matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. that means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. democrats' for the people act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the new york city system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.
the fact that it's been around for 30 years and it's still working, i think that's pretty remarkable, said lawrence norden, a lawyer for the brennan center for justice.
new york city's system has enabled candidates ― especially those from less affluent neighborhoods ― to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. the city's public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns, a 2012 study by the brennan center and the progressive think tank demos found.
this small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to washington, d.c.; montgomery and howard counties in maryland; and suffolk county, new york, among other places. new york state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program.
if new york city is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money, norden said. so, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than we've seen in the past raising from small donors. i think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors.
correction: a previous version of this story stated that teresa mosqueda was the first candidate in the country to run and win using democracy vouchers. she is the first first-time candidate to win.
danish siddiqui / reuters in 2013, india's supreme court reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization.
mumbai (thomson reuters foundation) - india's supreme court on monday agreed to reconsider its 2013 decision that criminalize consensual sexual relations between same sex adults, a victory for equal rights campaigners.
the court said a larger group of judges will re-examine the constitutional validity of section 377 - a colonial-era law that prohibits carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal - widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex.
what is natural to one may not be natural to others, the top court said on monday. a section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear.
lawyer anand grover, who appeared for five members of the lgbt community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, told the thomson reuters foundation: it is a big relief and a primary step taken by the supreme court to review its earlier order.
the petitioners had told the court they were living in constant fear of police action because of their sexual orientation.
we are being cautiously optimistic about the development today. we have climbed mountains of hope in the past and come toppling down, said gay rights activist harish iyer and host of gaydio, india's first radio show on lgbt issues.
india's supreme court had in a surprise ruling in 2013 reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization that had helped bring homosexuality into the open in the socially conservative country.
india's lgbt community has argued the ban undermines fundamental rights as it fails to protect them. but earlier petitions to review the ban were overturned by the court.
although the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in india, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.
there are no official figures on the number of cases and most go unreported as victims are too scared to report crimes to the police, fearing they will be punished too, activists say.
gay sex is punishable by up to 10 years jail under the law.
we want to emphasize that we are not asking for any special rights. we are asking for constitutional rights given to any citizen in the country, said koninika roy from the humsafar trust that works with the lgbt community.

gofundme may reimburse more than $20 million to people who contributed to an iraq war veteran's fundraiser to build a southern border wall.
that's because its organizer, brian kolfage, has suddenly changed the direction of the money, planning now to send it to a nonprofit he created rather than the federal government.
last month, when his gofundme page was started, kolfage vowed that 100% of your donations will go to the trump wall.
if for any reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation, he added.
those statements have since been removed from the page, where kolfage, a veteran living in florida, announced friday that he cannot get the money to the trump administration.
the federal government won't be able to accept our donations anytime soon, the update read.
as a replacement, kolfage said, has decided to send the donations to we build the wall, inc., the nonprofit he has formed along with a board of advisers.
our highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant segments of the wall in less time, and for far less money, than the federal government, while meeting or exceeding all required regulatory, engineering, and environmental specifications, he wrote on his fundraising page.
however, those who donated to his gofundme campaign must opt in to send their money to the nonprofit. if they don't, gofundme will return their contribution.
kolfage has voiced outrage over news of the refunds, claiming at the top of his page, the media is falsely reporting all money is being refunded and it's over. they are wrong.
gofundme spokesman bobby whithorne told the hill the refunds came about because kolfage broke the rules by switching the destination of the money.
in his statement, whithorne pointed out the change in statements on the page, noting that kolfage promised to return all donors' money if his goal wasn't reached.
however, that did not happen, he said. this means all donors will receive a refund.
although kolfage attempted to assure donors the campaign wasn't a scam when it began, he previously ran into trouble online.
in december, nbc news reported that kolfage's facebook page, right wing news, was taken down in a major sweep by the company as part of its initiative to rid the platform of pages run by fake accounts or those being used as ad farms using facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.
on thursday, buzzfeed news revealed that kolfage allegedly has a history of making money by spreading false news. one of his ventures, the outlet said, included another gofundme page that raised thousands of dollars for mentorship of veterans in military hospitals, but spokespeople at the facilities reportedly had no record of his work there or any sign that he donated the money.
he added: look, it's a very bad situation. we haven't seen anything like it, but the end result is we've got to get back to work, and i think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country.
i have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be, trump told fox news' sean hannity on thursday night. i don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. you know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. and now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?
president donald trump rejected calls from new york's governor that the state needed tens of thousands of new ventilators to treat a mass of patients infected with the novel coronavirus, saying he didn't believe those numbers were accurate.

the president's statements came as public health officials declared the united states the leading country in terms of coronavirus cases with more than 81,300 infected. more than 1,000 people have been killed by the virus, many in new york, which has the worst outbreak in the nation.
new york gov. andrew cuomo (d) responded friday by saying the numbers were based on facts, not a belief or a feeling.
i don't operate on opinion. i operate on facts, data, projections, cuomo said at his daily press conference, explaining the numbers are based on projections from public health experts.
all the projections say you could have an apex of 40,000 ventilators, he said. make the decisions based on the data and the science.
i hope we don't need the 30,000 ventilators, cuomo added. he said he wished there'd be some natural weather change that would wipe out the virus, apparently referring to trump's spurious suggestion last month that the virus would simply disappear as the weather gets warmer.
but that's my hope, that's my emotion, cuomo said. the numbers say you may need 30,000.
cuomo had warned thursday that the state's hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with patients afflicted with the covid-19 disease, noting more than 5,200 people had been hospitalized, including 1,290 in intensive care.
on tuesday cuomo said the federal emergency management agency was sending 400 ventilators after he warned that the state needed thousands more to deal with an impending apex of its infection rate that he estimated would take place in a few weeks.
what am i going to do with 400 ventilators when i need 30,000? cuomo said at a news conference at manhattan's javits center, which is being turned into a makeshift hospital to treat new yorkers. you want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? you're missing the magnitude of the problem.
trump later said 4,000 additional ventilators would be sent to new york's hospital system, but he blasted the governor's leadership, saying he had a chance to buy the machines in 2015 but turned it down. cuomo has ordered that 7,000 more be purchased but warned it's still not nearly enough. the state approved a plan to allow two patients to share one ventilator if needed as infections grow more dire.
the president has been insistent that the country can soon open up after many states have urged residents to self-isolate and socially distance in their communities to halt the spread of the virus. he's pushed the easter holiday weekend as his deadline, despite warnings from health officials that doing so could spell disaster.
i think we can open up sections, quadrants, keep them going until the whole country's opened up, trump told hannity on thursday. the people want to get back to work. they want to get back.

what did you think of smackdown live last night? tell me how title matches should always main event shows in the comments below.
to get the courage to try something...
to follow through with the courage you just musterd up to start something...
to not give up when the something you tried, failed...
to feel you know what you are doing...
okay, that may come to some but never comes to many. but i digress.
earlier today, i had a great conversation with an amazing woman who is working to not only support but to change the way women ceos in the software industry lead by helping them to learn from one another and lead with even greater strength and support.
and like many great undertakings, it all started with curiousity...why are there only 25 women ceos of hr software companies? where to women ceos meet to learn from one another? how often to women ceo's talk to one another to work through their challenges and their successes?
while this may surprise you, it didn't surprise me. but there is a lack of leadership support for women ceos, especially those in the software industry. yes, there are corporate leadership programs but there is a need to look at this challenge and approach it a new way.
and i hear this across the board, regardless of industry, where you live or where you work. the really, really big challenges and solutions come from curiosity.
why does it work this way?
where do i get information and support?
how much do i ask for?
it is the underpinnings of curiosity that lead to amazing discoveries.
and, you know what? this is often a topic of conversation that comes up with my coaching clients, during workshops or during retreats.
asking questions to which you don't know the answer.
growing up, i was super lucky to have parents that encouraged questions but i know many people for which that wasn't the case. dave and i now, with our boys, always tell the boys to stay curious. in fact, that is a quote that is written on our kitchen wall - thank you cadey charfen! [link to podcast interview] so, why is it that as we get older, we are told to:
[un]spoiler alert! to keep things as they are...to keep them comfortable.
yet, for those of you who like to:
know that there can be better ways of doing things...
stay curious! because it is the underpinnings of curiosity that makes for greatness...and success.
toronto — the canadian government is now advising citizens against all travel to a chinese province that's at the centre of a global outbreak of a new form of coronavirus, stepping up an earlier warning about the region.
on monday afternoon, the government updated its advice for travellers to say that canadians shouldn't go to hubei province at all.
avoid all travel to the province of hubei, including the cities of wuhan, huanggang and ezhou, due to the imposition of heavy travel restrictions in order to limit the spread of a novel coronavirus, the website stated.
previously, foreign affairs minister francois-philippe champagne had only advised canadians to avoid non-essential travel to the region.
the chinese government cut transportation links to and from the city of wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, on jan. 22. beijing has since expanded those controls to several nearby cities.
anyone travelling from wuhan is required to register and quarantine themselves for 14 days — the maximum incubation period for the virus.
the canadian travel warning followed further reassurances on monday from the country's top public health official that the risk from the disease remains minimal despite the discovery of a second presumptive case in canada.
dr. theresa tam said the two diagnoses involve a married couple from toronto who returned from wuhan on jan. 22. a man in his 50s was confirmed as canada's first official coronavirus patient earlier in the day, while the first of two rounds of tests indicates his wife has also contracted the illness.
tam said the likely diagnosis of a second case has not changed her view that the risk of contracting the virus remains low in canada, noting the two instances follow a reassuring pattern.
transmission of the virus is occurring among family members who have close and prolonged exposure to sick individuals, tam said in a teleconference. canadians should not be concerned that they can pick up the virus from an infected individual by any casual contact, such as walking through the airport or another public place.
some groups were already avoiding travel to china, with the university of regina announcing earlier monday that it has cancelled all china trips it had organized for the next three months due to the spread of the coronavirus.
health officials in ontario have said both the husband and wife who were diagnosed with coronavirus wore protective masks during the journey back to canada, a step the medical community has said can be helpful in preventing the spread of the illness.
tam said the man showed signs of a mild cough on the flight, and he and his wife both disclosed their recent travel history upon landing at toronto pearson international airport.
both federal and provincial officials have said the man sought hospital treatment for deteriorating symptoms the day after returning home, prompting paramedics to arrive on scene wearing protective equipment.
his status as the country's first prospective coronavirus case was announced on the weekend but confirmed on monday by ontario's senior public health officials.
dr. barbara yaffe, the province's associate chief medical officer of health, said the confirmation resulted from tests at the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg. the man initially tested positive at a provincial facility, as did his wife days later.
people are self-identifying and we continue to make sure the system is working. - dr. barbara yaffe, ontario's associate chief medical officer of health
tam said monday the woman's case is now awaiting confirmation at the national level, noting the lab is currently testing 25 samples from multiple provinces.
the man remains at toronto's sunnybrook hospital receiving treatment, while his wife is in self-isolation at home, officials said.
yaffe said several other prospective patients have been tested at the provincial level in recent days, with coronavirus being eliminated in at least 15 cases. results are still pending for 19 others, she added.
the good news here is that there is ongoing, active monitoring, she said. people are self-identifying and we continue to make sure the system is working.
ontario's chief medical officer of health, dr. david williams, said the patients currently being tested reside throughout the province, though many are concentrated in toronto.
cole burston via getty images travellers are seen wearing masks at the international arrivals area at the toronto pearson international airport on sunday.
toronto mayor john tory said he's requested that all public health information related to coronavirus be translated into languages other than english or french to ensure the city's diverse population can stay informed.
echoing public health officials who stress the risk of contracting coronavirus remains low, tory urged residents to maintain business as usual.
be careful, be vigilant, but you don't have to change your life at the moment, he said.
federal officials said sunday they were reaching out to passengers who travelled on the same china southern airlines flight with the couple and sat within two metres of them.
williams said those who are not currently exhibiting the flu-like symptoms consistent with coronavirus are likely not contagious.
if somebody does not have symptoms, they usually are not shedding, he said, adding researchers are continually studying the virus and becoming more familiar with its characteristics.
the new form of coronavirus, a close cousin to respiratory illnesses such as sars and mers, originated in china and has spread rapidly in recent weeks.
officials in that country have reported the illness has killed at least 106 people and infected more than 4,500 others, as of tuesday morning. several countries throughout asia, europe and north america have also confirmed cases of the illness. it remains to be seen whether the virus is as dangerous as the common flu, which kills thousands every year in canada alone.
yaffe said all cases outside of china so far include a travel history to that country, adding that ontario emergency dispatchers have now been instructed to ask about that issue while screening calls from those showing signs of a respiratory illness.
tam said a committee including officials from federal, provincial and territorial governments will be established on tuesday to help share information.
this report by the canadian press was first published jan. 27, 2020.
there are also types of coronavirus that originated in animals and evolved to impact humans. these include: mers-cov (coronavirus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome, or mers), sars-cov (coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars), and most recently, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov).
the latest type of coronavirus – known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) – is one of seven types of coronavirus identified since the mid 1960s. there are four common human coronaviruses, where the symptoms tend to be less problematic. these are 229e, nl63, oc43 and hku1.
the study's authors estimate that, on average, each patient in the hospital had spread the infection to at least two other people. meanwhile on home soil, a british man who became infected in singapore is thought to be responsible for at least seven other confirmed cases in england, france and spain.
a single patient with coronavirus infected at least 10 healthcare workers and four patients at a hospital in wuhan, china, according to a study , which shows just how fast – and easily – the virus can spread.
southampton university's world pop project a prediction of the spread of the virus, calculated by southampton university's world pop project research group using data from chinese tech giant baidu.
so how do these viruses spread?
with previous outbreaks like mers and sars, human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets (i.e. when you cough and sneeze), contact with others, and touching infected objects or materials.
paul hunter, a professor in medicine at university of east anglia, reiterates this, telling huffpost uk coronaviruses are spread largely by droplets in the air. as the old saying goes: coughs and sneezes spread diseases.
if a person with coronavirus coughs or sneezes and another person is within two metres of where they're standing, they could inhale infected droplets. likewise, if an infected person coughs or sneezes onto their hand, then touches a door handle, another person who touches that door handle could pick up the virus.
if an uninfected person touches these surfaces, then washes their hands immediately (and properly), there wouldn't necessarily be a problem. but if they go on to touch their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected with the virus. in fact, touching anywhere near the mouth – for example, smoking – could cause infection, says prof hunter.
that's how colds spread [and how] sars spread, he says. it is undoubtedly the primary way 2019 novel coronavirus spreads.
dr nick phin, deputy director of the national infection service at public health england (phe) echoes this, adding: while not a lot is known about the novel coronavirus, it is likely to behave in a similar way to other respiratory viruses.
it's unclear how long surfaces are contaminated for after an infected person has touched it – although under most circumstances, phe says the amount of infectious virus is likely to have decreased significantly by 24 hours, and even more so by 48 hours.
dr phin says how long any respiratory virus survives will depend on a number of factors: for example, what the virus is on, whether it is exposed to sunlight, differences in temperature and humidity, and exposure to cleaning products – even simple ones like soapy water and household cleaning sprays.
experts don't currently know whether people without symptoms of coronavirus – but who are infected with the virus – are infectious or not. if it's only symptomatic people who spread the virus, you don't need to worry too much about quarantining asymptomatic people [a person showing no symptoms], says prof hunter.
but, as we don't yet know at what stage the virus spreads, it's important to take whatever precaution you can by continuing to maintain good hygiene.
the best way to stop germs spreading is to: avoid close contact with people (particularly those suffering from respiratory infection symptoms); frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water (or using sanitiser gel); and cough or sneeze into tissues, and then bin those tissues. this advice is useful for all winter viruses that may be circulating – not just for protecting against coronavirus.
if the 2019 novel coronavirus does turn into a pandemic, this advice might change, prof hunter notes.
in the flurry of new year's resolutions that so many of us inevitably make, maybe you succumbed to dating sunday and took the plunge of signing up for an online dating site. match.com says the sunday after new year's day is the busiest day of the year, with a 60 percent spike in new members between christmas and valentine's day.
but even more than most resolutions, this one might be quick to be broken.
for good reason--as common as online dating has become, there's a lot of negativity surrounding it still: it seems like everyone on there is married (thank you, ashley madison), or just trying to hook up (thank you, tinder), or trying to con you or kill you or sell you into slavery (thank you, entire internet).
and there are plenty of other horror stories--the players and sexters and clingers and weirdos. there's the awkwardness, the rudeness, the disappointments. many who sign onto a dating site lose interest and motivation long before their subscription has expired.
i tried online dating three separate times over a period of a few years, and each time wound up hiding my profile in discouragement or disgust just a couple of months in.
i was badly burned out on the format, but, as a self-employed writer and editor who mostly lived in a cave with only my computer for company, it wasn't like my path was crossing with a whole bunch of eligible single men. not seeing any other options, though, eventually i reluctantly decided to try again.
but in this final try at internet dating, i made one crucial change:
several of my girlfriends had been down the same road, trying internet dating with varying degrees of success, and they offered to be my dating buddies: a panel of advisers who would help me with everything from how to present myself in my profile and pics, to vetting the men who contacted me, to pep talks (and consolation calls!) before and after in-person dates.
my friends checked out the men who were contacting me. this one's cropped a girl out of the pic--next! one would decree, or, i know you want someone tall--i'm six feet--but this guy's only an inch shorter than you are, and he loves to read and travel, just like you--why not consider him?
when we finally picked likely prospects together, i would let one of them know when i had an in-person date so someone had the man's contact info and my last-known whereabouts...just in case he was a psycho killer.
i also called debriefed with them after--and when i had dates like the one where a guy told me about his four ex-wives within the first ten minutes, or talked on his cell phone for literally half the date, or blatantly checked out another woman's boobs, rehashing my travails with my gal pals made them seem hilarious rather than simply discouraging.
there are plenty of articles and even tv shows like tlc's love at first swipe that teach you to create a snazzy profile, but don't address the big-picture challenges of online dating: reentering the dating market when you're over 40, whether it's ever okay to lie/stretch the truth in your profile, what subtext reveals in your own profile and others', etc.
and though there are services and people you can hire to help you with those aspects of dating--online and otherwise, it's not always affordable or feasible for everyone to hire a pro.
for me, sharing the experience with my friends made it less lonely, less daunting--and a whole lot more fun.
and when i finally met the man i wound up marrying--who i probably wouldn't have met any other way--i had dear friends to celebrate it with who were there from the very beginning. (one of our very first dates involved him facing a gauntlet of these six women over cocktails, every one of them meticulously checking him out.)
it took kissing a lot of virtual frogs to get to my prince--and it also took a village. without the input, advice, sympathy, and encouragement of my friends, i might still be clicking around and bemoaning the uselessness of online dating.
so this year i'm proposing that if you're one of the almost 50 million singles who try online dating, you do things a little differently: date by committee.
if you've wanted to try online dating and hesitated--or you have tried before and hated it--maybe 2016 is the year to grab your own dating buddy and take the plunge.

decatur, ga. — over the past few years, statehouses around the country have tried to rein in cities deemed too friendly to undocumented immigrants. but georgia is the only state that's created an independent board with one specific mission: punishing cities that aren't doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration.
typically, that responsibility falls to state attorneys general. but in georgia, residents can file a complaint against any city or county they judge to be breaking state immigration law.
until a recent case against the small liberal town of decatur, though, all but one of the complaints had come from one private citizen, an avowed anti-illegal immigration activist who's made this his life's calling.
then the lieutenant governor, republican casey cagle, filed a complaint accusing decatur of violating state immigration law last year as he was running for governor. and on facebook, he threatened to yank its state funding.
liberal politicians in the city of decatur are trying to put the interests of criminal illegal aliens ahead of our safety — and i will not allow it! cagle wrote. (he did not respond to repeated requests from stateline for comment.)
few locals have heard of it, but georgia's immigration enforcement review board was created seven years ago, when the state passed one of the nation's strictest immigration laws. trying to keep track of the legal comings and goings of the ierb, as the board is known, can be dizzying.
most of its members are not attorneys or immigration experts. all are volunteers — and all are political appointees, which in this red state makes it a majority republican board.
and while technically not a court, the board has been given many of the powers of a court: it investigates alleged wrongdoing, subpoenas witnesses and hears testimony.
the board has the power to recommend sanctions against municipalities found to be in the wrong — and ultimately, withhold millions in state funding from them as punishment.
so far, though, it has levied just one lasting fine, for $1,000 against atlanta. a handful of small cities, though, have been forced to spend time and money defending themselves against accusations.
two of the immigration board members refused to step down years after their terms ended, and did so only in 2018, when they were sued by a decatur resident and accused of violating georgia law.
the georgia board is an example of what not to do, rather than a model for something effective, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies for the center for immigration studies, a national research and advocacy group that favors limited immigration to the united states.
it's troubling, vaughan said, to have that authority go to a politically appointed group that lacks expertise in the subject matter.
the city of decatur has filed two lawsuits against the board, saying it has violated public meetings and public records laws; the georgia first amendment foundation and the southern poverty law center joined one of the suits in december. (under james balli's tenure as chair, he has made efforts to make the board more transparent, including releasing records to a reporter.)
balli said it is just complying with state immigration law in its work, and until that law is changed, it'll continue with its charge.
the 2011 law the board is focused on, hb 87, permits law enforcement officers to stop anyone they deem to be suspicious and ask for their papers. the law also requires cities and counties, and many businesses, to use e-verify to ensure workers are in the country legally; and punishes those who use fake identification to get work.
the goal is compliance, not punishment, balli said.
we're not anti-immigration, balli said, adding that his grandmother was an immigrant from mexico. we don't want that to be the picture of this board.
decatur's been described as a speck of blue in a sea of red, and that is true — up to a point. there have always been specks of blue in georgia, and the state is increasingly trending purple. in november, democrat stacey abrams narrowly lost to republican brian kemp in the race for governor.
but decatur, as the atlanta journal-constitution puts it, is renowned as a bastion of southern liberalism. it's atlanta's hippie cousin — population 23,800 — 4 square miles of bungalows, yoga studios and farm-to-table fare. in 2016, 86 percent of voters here cast their lot with hillary clinton.
both decatur and its next-door neighbor atlanta issued directives in 2017 ordering local police not to detain immigrants, barring a court order. decatur doesn't even have a jail — and has few immigrants.
but for the past year, it is decatur, not atlanta, that has been in battle with the state, fighting accusations that it is a sanctuary city.
and even though the ierb has yet to yank state funding in any of the cases it's heard, decatur officials say they worry the city could lose millions in funding if the board tried to take action.
many critics of the board, who fall on both sides of the immigration battle, have said it should be disbanded.
it's a court that operates in very strange, mostly nontransparent ways and yet has a tremendous amount of power, said naomi tsu, who oversees the legal and advocacy work on behalf of immigrants in the deep south for the alabama-based southern poverty law center. the center has profiled the ierb on its hatewatch blog.
then there's marietta, georgia, resident d.a. king, who's filed 20 of the 22 complaints that have come before the board. he called the ierb a parody of a kangaroo court.
king, a detroit native, describes himself as a nationalist along the lines of a george washington, but says that he's not a white supremacist. nor is he against legal immigration. my adopted sister is from korea, he said.
i'm trying to educate people about immigration. it's about the law and what's good for america and americans.
originally, georgia lawmakers wanted to create a court for dealing with complaints against cities and counties that were allegedly violating the law, said rusi patel, senior associate general counsel at the georgia municipal association, a membership and advocacy organization representing georgia's cities and counties.
but local governments, worried about long, expensive court hearings, pushed for an alternative, patel said. the ierb was created as a compromise.
personally, i've been hedging back and forth for a while, whether we've done the right thing, patel said.
i don't know if we have.
the board meets quarterly. some meetings have wrapped up in three minutes. others have stretched on for hours, with tempers flaring. in june, for example, bryan downs, the decatur city attorney, asked then-board member phil kent why he was participating in the meeting when kent had already recused himself from the decatur case.
kent refused to answer, downs said, and when pushed, demanded that the two men step outside to settle their differences, downs recalled.
it was kind of a macho thing, 'step out in the hall, mano a mano,' downs said. it was weird.
kent did not respond to a request for comment.
on a recent december morning, though, three of the six board members were in attendance, and a fourth board member called in. it's not clear where the other board members were.
one by one, the board went down a list of seven complaints against seven local school districts, all filed by king.
but he was nowhere to be found. that's because, he said later, no one told him his complaints would be heard that day.
it likely wouldn't have mattered if i was there, he said, because the last time they heard my complaints, they refused to allow me to speak.
king accused the school districts of teaching english to the immigrant parents of schoolchildren in violation of a georgia law that says anyone receiving public benefits, including adult education classes, must document that they are in the country legally.
federal law prohibited schools from asking students their immigration status, balli said in the meeting, so the adult education classes weren't breaking any laws. plus, he said, children benefit when their parents can help with homework.
from a policy standpoint, this is the right thing to do, balli said. we want children to learn.
the board dismissed all the complaints. (on jan. 1, king appealed the board's decision.)
the board then decided to make a policy change and only hear two complaints a year from the same person — a change clearly targeted against king.
it might prohibit some of the unnecessary filing, balli said. he turned to the representative from the attorney general's office.
yes, the representative said. you must hear all complaints, but it doesn't matter when you hear them.
and after 21 minutes, the meeting was adjourned, with little or no comment from the other board members. (the board is scheduled to meet again jan. 8, ahead of schedule, through a conference call. critics have complained the board is too secretive and schedules meetings on a whim without much notice.)
the pew charitable trusts the georgia immigration enforcement review board meets quarterly in atlanta. few were in attendance at its december meeting.
right as the meeting wrapped up, a woodstock, georgia-based lawyer, karen sacandy, arrived, looking flustered and a little out of breath.
she said she makes a point of making the 45-minute drive down to attend every meeting she can.
like king, she's driven by her strong belief that immigration should be checked.
she said the ierb isn't doing nearly enough to crack down on immigration, both legal and illegal. she'd like to see all immigration curtailed, because, she said, all immigrants — the latins and the indians — do is drain government resources and take jobs away from american citizens.
aren't you worried about the blacks and unemployment? she asked a reporter. well, i am.
the ierb, she said, needs to be destroyed because it provides a facade that something's being done when really, nothing is being done.
it would be hilarious, she said, if it weren't so tragic.
these battles will likely get more heated, immigration experts say, unless congress takes steps to fully define the authority of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement and the role of local law enforcement agencies.
clashes between cities and states over cooperating with ice have been occurring with greater frequency with the trump administration, said randy capps, director of research, u.s. programs, for the migration policy institute, a research group based out of washington, d.c.
in his complaint against decatur, cagle, the lieutenant governor, alleged that city officials had violated the state's prohibition against local governments adopting, enacting, implementing, or enforcing an immigration sanctuary policy. they issued an order which threatens the city's law enforcement officers with disciplinary action for fully communicating and cooperating with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) and federal law enforcement.
decatur is not a sanctuary city, mayor patti garrett said, because it doesn't harbor immigrants who've been convicted or charged with crimes.
the lieutenant governor's complaint raised eyebrows for two reasons: georgia law specifies that private citizens, rather than public officials, can file complaints against municipalities. and two of the board members were his appointees.
decatur is known as a progressive city, garrett said. and the lieutenant governor wanted to show some muscle on this issue. we were held up as an example.
city officials vow to keep fighting.
we're not going to be bullied, downs said.
every new year, food-related goals make their way to my top five new year resolutions; however, after interacting with four young founders of two food-based startups in new york city, i've learned to keep a more wholesome mindset as goals around food and dietary consumption create a ripple effect around food waste, healthy living, and overconsumption for local populations.
transfernation and sani are two startups based out of manhattan working to combat the city's hunger problem and catalyze healthy living lifestyles. sani is a vegan-based meal replacement personalized to the consumer's unique dietary needs and contains every nutrient your body needs. transfernation is a non-profit group that has rescued over 10,000 pounds of cuisine since it began its operations in october 2014.
both pairs of founders, samir goel and hannah dehradunwala of transfernation, and sebastian garcia and danielle soto of sani, started their organizations with conversations over food. in the case of the sani founders, conversations turned into data analysis where they used a quantified approach to nutrition so we could hit our respective macros, said soto about sani's genesis. for transfernation, observation and conversation turned into analysis on the concept of food redistribution, starting with questions like what happens after we dump the food?. given the astronomical scale upon which hunger and poverty exist, co-founder dehradunwala found that there's a blatant gap in the current status quo where there is no service in place to redistribute the hundreds of pounds of extra food that is often left over after catered events. the burden of food redistribution cannot solely be placed on event planners and caterers, which is the opportunity transfernation was born on.
transfernation is the service that uses an app to deliver extra-catered food from various events to soup kitchens and shelters. their app allows people who want to donate food to get in touch with volunteers to come, pick it up, and drop it off to the closest homeless shelter or soup kitchen- all within the hour. sani is updating their interactive web platform to ask six simple questions about you and your fitness goals, and builds a meal replacement that you can either bake or drink to help you meet your goal.
the technology integration became a necessity for the two organizations after realizing their initial assumptions about the marketplace were going to need adjustments. the reality of any business is that ideas don't always translate from paper to the real world, said transfernation's goel. goel and dehradunwala realized that donors wanted as little involvement as possible, due to the sheer scale of some of the events they were hosting. secondly, they believed that the soup kitchens and shelters that transfernation would be partnering with would have the capacity to rescue extra food. but while the soup kitchens and shelters had the infrastructure, they lacked the manpower. according to goel, this led us to consider volunteer-based operations as the best way to provide value to our end beneficiaries.
on sani's side, their core idea never changed but the manner of execution had to. people not only want a product that'll help them look good, but a product that will taste good too, noted garcia. while the core idea hasn't changed, the ingredients consistently do. the balance between nutritional data and the customer feedback meant that they had to ensure that the product was healthy, and pivoted to include 5 flavors, ranging from mexican chocolate to coffee to peanut butter. now that we have a core product that is popular with our consumer base, we can extend our efforts to making sure user interaction with our site is as top-notch as it can be, said soto.
trying to evolve food intake into meal supplements is not only an indulgence for wealthy consumers. garcia and soto are planning to evolve sani's business line, admitting that while we're still a start-up that is perfecting our supply chain, our future includes a buy one, give one plan, where a consumer who is able to buy a sani meal also provides a meal to a child in need. being business students, garcia and soto have determined that donating food to a developing country or area actually can hurt that local economy more than help it. we want to work with organizations that already have established relationships, like who's child-meal program, said garcia, to avoid the risk of hurting more than helping.
what started as an effort to make food redistribution fast and easy now also incorporates volunteer-based food rescue mission to increase their range of impact. for goel and dehradunwala, transfernation is running a crowdfunding donation effort to catalyze their 2016 volunteer efforts. we have been asked to expand our efforts to other cities around the us, but we just don't have the manpower yet, said goel. their donation campaign is going to be used to add people to their core team, scale operations and transportation, and incentivize volunteers.
rep. alexandra ocasio-cortez of new york's 14th district hasn't even been in congress for a week, and she's already attracted more criticism on the national stage than most other politicians will probably receive all year.
but not all of that criticism is from the right.
on the view monday, whoopi goldberg dinged ocasio-cortez after the congresswoman's 60 minutes interview with anderson cooper on sunday.
we as a party have compromised too much, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a clip from the interview. and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are.
goldberg argued that ocasio-cortez wasn't giving her democratic predecessors the credit they deserve.
it is very, very difficult when people make accusations where you say, you know, the democrats have done nothing, the establishment of the democrats have done nothing, the host said. and i just want to throw this out to you: [rep.] john lewis wasn't sitting still. [sen.] dianne feinstein wasn't sitting still.
there are a lot of people in the democratic party, goldberg said, who have been busting their asses.
ocasio-cortez has taken a number of anti-establishment positions since arriving on the political scene. she ruffled the feathers of some party colleagues in november when she encouraged future primary challenges against democratic incumbents. she also participated in a climate change protest outside then-house minority leader speaker nancy pelosi's office during her congressional orientation.
it requires risk to try something new, but also we know so much of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked either, ocasio-cortez told cooper.
before you start pooping on people and what they've done, you got to do something, too, goldberg said on the view.
ultimately, though, goldberg seemed to give ocasio-cortez more encouragement than condemnation.
so you just got in there, and i know you got lots of good ideas, the host said, but i would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.

barcroft media via getty images pro-choice campaigners stage a demonstration on june 5. 2018, in parliament square in london demanding the british government decriminalizes abortion in northern ireland following the result of the referendum in the republic of ireland last month.
ireland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.
as part of the country's domestic violence act 2018, which went into effect on new year's day, coercive control is now recognized as domestic violence and is punishable by up to five years in prison. the legislation defines coercive control as psychological abuse in an intimate relationship that causes fear of violence, or serious alarm or distress that has a substantial adverse impact on a person's day-to-day activities.
the new law makes ireland one of only a handful of countries that have set such a precedent. it's an important step in ireland, where one in five women experiences some form of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse by an intimate partner in her lifetime, according to the irish anti-domestic violence organization women's aid.
the new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship, ireland's minister for justice and equality, charlie flanagan, said in a statement on wednesday.
this new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.
the domestic violence act 2018 also criminalizes forced marriage, allows restraining orders for couples who do not live together and restricts media coverage in cases of gender-based violence.
women's aid director margaret martin said her organization will be closely monitoring the implementation of the legislation.
from january 1, 2019, women must feel change quickly. it must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse, she said in a tuesday statement.
she noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, martin said. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by women's aid. that year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.
dr. adizes: i welcome you to adizes methodology.
i think it would be good if i express to you what i believe is critical to make the methodology successful and why some companies are not fully successful.
what is the essence of the methodology?
we all deal with change. whenever there is change there are going to be problems. how do you handle problems? how do you grow a company when there is so much change?
the problem is that there is uncertainty, you don't know what is going to happen, and there is risk. how to handle uncertainty and risk better than the competition?
this methodology was not developed in the library in a university. i left the university to go to the real world and see how to make this happen; how to make companies grow, in spite of uncertainty and risk.
this methodology has been tested for 50 years. please look at our website and you will see presidents of companies who say they grew the company from $12 million to $4 billion with the adizes methodology. it is a testament for the methodology. it has been tested in 58 countries, in companies from startups to the biggest in the world.
if you have a complementary team, you see things i don't see; i see things you don't see. together we see more. that reduces uncertainty.
now, if you have the same interest, if we have common interest, that will make risk lower because those who you need will cooperate. when there is common interest there is cooperation. when there is cooperation there is less risk. a complementary team that shares knowledge and is based on common interests, reduces uncertainty and reduces risk.
that raises the question, what causes people to share information to make better decisions?
and what will make people have common interest?
so the whole adizes methodology is how to build mutual trust and respect in a company, so that the company can handle risk and uncertainty, and handle change better. not only to make you happier, but also to make you richer.
a company will grow better outside if it is integrated inside. if people are fighting inside, no energy is available to deal with the outside.
now the question: how do you build mutual trust and respect? especially in russia ( the audience is russian, ed note) -- because russia does not have a history of democracy. it was always a totalitarian system, and companies in russia are run in a totalitarian way. so there is a cultural problem: we have to change the culture inside the company.
the program is very systematic, with a program and manuals.... the results are exceptional. as i told you, companies grew from $12 million to $4 billion. but the program is not easy to apply. changing the culture of a company is a very, very time-consuming and difficult job.
it is normal that people want change as long as they don't have to change. so in order for the program to work, in order for a company to succeed with the adizes methodology, it requires commitment.
many times a president of a company has asked me, dr. adizes, have you ever failed? i say, yes. not every company succeeds.
and they ask me, what is the difference?
i look them in the eye and say, you.
how committed are you? because people will complain: it takes too much time... it's too much work... we cannot do it... are you going to hold the line? or not?
adizes is not a consulting company. it's not a training company. we are like a coach. we will train you to be an olympic champion but you have to work hard. you have to do it. and it's not going to be easy.
what is going to be difficult?
number one: the program takes time. you cannot hire somebody to do physical exercise for you. that is what is wrong with some big consulting firms: you hire them to do the work for you. you just need a report and the job is finished. is it?
to be a champion you have to show up. but i don't have time, people complain. in that case forget adizes. try a consulting firm, and good luck.
adizes requires commitment -- at minimum one to two days a month. if you really don't have time, then you start the adizes program at 1 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 o'clock at night twice a month.
problem number two: as a first-line supervisor, you tell people what to do. you listen, but not too much. your mouth is big; your ears are small.
as you ascend the hierarchy to be the president of a company, your mouth should become small and your ears should become big. small mouth and big ears. that's right: you have to listen what is going on.
you have to listen to the people, what is going on with them. you are now far from the action. they are on the fighting floor, so you have to listen to what is happening down there. that is where the roots of the tree are. watch the roots, not just the leaves. financial statements are important but remember they are the leaves not the roots of your success.
that means that you have to change your style. you have to sit in the room and listen to the people. some people are difficult. you must learn how to lead people whose style is different from yours.
adizes is training you so you can handle change in the future without us. we are proud of every client we lose. our job is to teach you the tools how to manage as a team, and then say goodbye, thank you very much. finished. it's like psychotherapy, organizational therapy: you should not be dependent on your therapist for too long. a good therapist makes sure you are healthy and says goodbye, you are done with therapy. you are on your own. you can come to our conventions every year and learn what is new and update yourself so your company continues to grow.
you get 4 results from the program:
and you enrich your managerial style.
i can promise you one thing: if you do a diagnosis of your company, and you identify problems which are chronic -- they come back, and back, and back, and back--this is what is blocking your growth of the company -- this is what you lose sleep over at night -- i promise you--because we have the experience of 50 years, thousands of companies -- 40% of these chronic problems will disappear. minimum. 40% will be better; 20% will not change; and the second year, what was better will disappear, what did not change will become better. in 3 years, all problems you have today should disappear. that is on average. some companies do it faster. it all depends on how committed you, the ceo, are to give time and energy.
in 3 years, it does not mean that you will have no more problems. you will have bigger problems. because you are as big as the problems you are dealing with. today maybe you have problems of quality control, you have problems of marketing, and maybe you have problems of hiring the right people. in 3 years, you will have a big problem: how to become an international company. by solving the small problems you can address the bigger problems.
once i sent a new years card, with wishes for the new year to my clients: i wish you bigger problems next year than this year that you can solve. tell me how big the problems you are dealing with are and i will tell you how big you are.
the adizes methodology does not only make the company bigger, it makes you -- you personally -- better. people say that it helps their marriage. next year it's coming out, a new book of mine on how to apply adizes in family life. and i just finished yesterday a new book on how to apply adizes to personal life. so, this methodology is not a consulting methodology, it's a philosophy of life.
i welcome you, i hope that you will enjoy the methodology, and i hope you will join us and many, many companies around the world and have a better company and a better quality of life.
during the ladies' short event, french figure skater maé-bérénice méité carved out a place for herself by skating to music including the beyoncé hits halo and run the world (girls). but that's not the only aspect of her performance making waves. méité emerged from the masses in a bodysuit with pants. yes, you read that right: a figure skater competed at the pyeongchang olympics sans skirt.
the 23-year-old took to the ice in black leggings that appeared to be attached to a gold and black sparkly sleeveless top. and her performance was just as dazzling as it would have been in a frilly, flouncy skirt, if not more so, because it was so bold. méité expressively floated and twirled around the ice winning the hearts of the world, despite her fall, with her boundary-pushing music (this is the first olympics at which skaters are allowed to use music with lyrics!) and even more daring ensemble. these twitter reactions sum it up.

i don't care about how the skate goes, but mae-berenice meité wearing pants and skating to beyoncé is a powerful thing — andrea (@aaperezzle) february 11, 2018
unfortunately, the judges weren't as impressed, giving her a score of 46.62, putting her in ninth place. did she lose points for her pants? not possible. according to the nbc olympics page, ladies in singles and pairs can wear a skirt, pants or tights. however, that wasn't always the rule. after katarina witt came out on the ice in a few feathers barely covering her behind in 1988, the international skating union enacted a rule that women had to wear skirts. that rule was overturned in the early 2000s, bringing back the pants.

photo: david madison/getty images katarina witt in the 1988 calgary olympics, sporting the blue dress that sparked the so-called katarina rule.
then why don't more women wear pants? for one, it seems not everyone is up to date on the new rules. last week, costume designer jan longmire told instyle, the guidelines change every now and then, but every girl always has to wear a skirt — she can't come out in a leotard on its own.
plus, skirts are just easier on the eyes and more frequently identified with femininity, which is what figure skating is pretty much all about. but if women can wear tuxedos on the red carpet and not be any less elegant, female skaters can do the same in the rink. and they have.
méité might prefer pants; she competed in the same costume at the women's short program dance during the internationaux de france isu grand prix of figure skating in grenoble, france, in november. she also wore pants for her free skate at the 2014 olympics — the unitard was similar, but the sparkly top was silver, blue, and black.

a week after president donald trump incited his supporters to storm the u.s. capitol in an attempt to overthrow the government and stop lawmakers from certifying president-elect joe biden's electoral win, house republicans are outraged.
they are outraged that they have to use a metal detector at work.
the house sergeant at arms announced tuesday that lawmakers will now have to be screened before entering the house chamber in an effort to provide a safe and secure environment for conducting business. the change comes after some lawmakers raised concerns about trump's allies in congress being co-conspirators with the insurrectionists and potentially carrying guns onto the house floor, which is prohibited.
most lawmakers were fine with the enhanced security. after all, it was just last week when they feared for their lives and barricaded themselves in the house chamber as capitol police officers fended off violent white supremacists trying to smash their way inside. the insurrection left five people dead, and it could have been way, way worse.
but starting tuesday evening and going into wednesday, some house republicans had full-blown tantrums at the idea of walking through a metal detector ― something everyone else in america has to do all the time, whether at airports, schools or other buildings.
horse shit! shouted rep. rodney davis (r-ill.). bullshit!
you are creating a problem you do not understand the ramifications of! rep. steve womack (r-ark.) warned capitol police officers.
you can't stop me, i'm on my way to a vote, said rep. louie gohmert (r-texas), walking around the magnetometer outside the house chamber.
rep. russ fulcher (r-idaho) just pushed his way through. he went through the metal detector and set it off, shoved an officer out of his way and walked into the house.
jonathan ernst / reuters rep. marjorie taylor greene (r-ga), a qanon conspiracy theorist, is searched outside the house chamber tuesday night. her mask says molon labe, a greek phrase meaning come and take them that the right wing uses as an anti-gun control slogan.
rep. steve stivers (r-ohio) made a point to tell capitol police officers that he thinks that making lawmakers use metal detectors is unconstitutional. so did rep. chip roy (r-texas), who said a metal detector is unconstitutional and endangers members. (there is nothing in the constitution about not having to walk through a metal detector.)
at best, the fact that any member of congress is fuming about the inconvenience of a metal detector ― days after a violent insurrection at the capitol, when the coronavirus is killing roughly 4,000 americans every day, in the midst of a presidential impeachment ― reflects an embarrassing level of entitlement and shows how out of touch they are with regular americans, who would not fare well at airport security if they shouted about the constitution and blew past the metal detector.
at worst, it suggests they are bringing guns onto the house floor and don't want to get caught. there's precedent for this concern: rep. madison cawthorn (r-n.c.) said he was armed during the insurrection, which gop lawmakers like him helped incite in the first place.
rep. steve scalise, the no. 2 republican, told me that the situation is untenable because it impedes the ability of members to come and vote. this is our job. these are the lines pic.twitter.com/z6wp9zxmc0 — manu raju (@mkraju) january 13, 2021
at least one congresswoman of color, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), said she was scared she would be killed during the lockdown in part because of white supremacists in congress who might publicly reveal her location. rep. cedric richmond (d-la.), who is leaving congress for a job in the biden administration, similarly said wednesday that he believed some of his colleagues may be co-conspirators with the insurrectionists.
some of the same gop lawmakers fuming about metal detectors were recently all about using them for enhanced security. just not for themselves.
in 2018, house republicans passed the stop school violence act to provide schools with more money to prevent gun violence. among other things, the money was authorized to install metal detectors.
among those voting for that bill? bucshon, davis, gohmert and stivers.
i also support ... improving school safety by increasing funding for schools to have metal detectors, stivers said in a statement at the time.
horse shit! rep. rodney davis (r-ill.), so angry about a metal detector
it's not clear what authority capitol police officers have, if any, to stop lawmakers from going onto the house floor without being screened first. they are not allowed to arrest members of congress on their way to a vote, per the constitution. they also can't arrest them while they're in a session in their chamber, or when they're going to or coming from that chamber. the only exceptions are if they're committing treason, a felony or a breach of the peace.
but house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) may have figured out a way to tamp down on lawmakers' defiance of metal detectors: fines.
in a wednesday night statement, pelosi said the house will move forward with a rule change when it comes back in session on jan. 21 that will impose fines on members of congress who refuse to abide by these protections.
the fine for the first offense will be $5,000, and $10,000 for the second offense. the fines will be deducted directly from lawmakers' salaries.
it is tragic that this step is necessary, pelosi said, but the chamber of the people's house must and will be safe.
in the united states, the trump administration has come under fire from critics for what they say has been a slow gearing up of testing for the new virus.
u.s. vice president mike pence promised on sunday that americans would have access in the days ahead to more than 2,000 laboratories capable of processing tests.
with limited testing available, u.s. officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 62 deaths, and large segments of daily activities have been upended across the country.
tedros said on monday the strategy to contain the disease - identifying people with infections and rapidly isolating them - was still the best approach, and had shown positive effects in china, south korea and singapore.
many countries have limited testing to the old or with pre-existing conditions, refusing tests for others with milder symptoms who can nevertheless spread the virus. often they simply do not have the resources to carry out more tests.
paul molinaro, in charge of operations, support and logistics at the who, called for a change in mindset to overcome supply shortages in items such as test kits and protective equipment to fight the pandemic.
hbo nicole kidman's character in a much-talked-about green coat from hbo's recent limited series, the undoing.
i had no interest in watching hbo's latest whodunit, the undoing. i had heard rumblings comparing it to big little lies and felt no urge to change course from watching hours of old episodes of real housewives. but strangers on twitter were aghast and the final reveal was seemingly big.
after seeing so much hype, i figured it has to be worth it. after all, twitter is never wrong. described as an east coast 'big little lies,' i figured the show would have twists and turns to keep me hooked for six episodes. so i spent a few days bingeing and watching seemingly unnecessary close-up shots of nicole kidman. almost all my knowledge revolved around talk of her coats on the show, from a velvety green number to a wine-colored robe ― sartorial experts were extremely excited about the outwear of their beloved protagonist.
agree about the undoing. very whatever. nicole's kidman's coats were the main draw, which says a lot. — jamie litoff (@jamielitoff) december 19, 2020
while i felt completely unsatisfied by the entire show ― ending included — i felt equally lukewarm about the fashion. the passion around kidman's coats left me flabbergasted.
the coats were … fine? mediocre?
not sure why the undoing is the coat show of the pandemic when kaley cuoco wears a different, even more amazing coat in every single episode of the flight attendant. i demand coverage! — taffy brodesser-akner (@taffyakner) december 19, 2020
the coats didn't overtly tell a story. we knew little about the brand of coats, where they came from or what made them especially significant to a character whose life is seemingly falling apart around her. the colors were vibrant and yes, against kidman's red hair, something pretty to look at. yet the coats became one of the most talked-about aspects of the show.
there surely have been tv shows (crime-related or otherwise) that featured more significant, memorable coats. so let's shine some light on the shows, both of yesteryear and today, whose coats are truly worthy scene stealers.
not only is killing eve actually a good thriller, the antagonist villanelle perfectly incorporates sartorial aspects to a genre not explicitly known for well-dressed characters. killing eve marries fashion and thrilling plotlines pretty perfectly, a theme the undoing certainly could've picked up on. to her core, villanelle is a woman who appreciates fashion trends and dressing up ― she might even feel good in doing so. with kidman's grace, fashion seems implied by her status but stops short in telling a deeper story about the character, or frankly, the plot. the outwear in killing eve also feels much more meaningful ― the characters actually have to keep warm in various cold-weathered locations. and as is typical with villanelle, her outerwear certainly lands her on best-dressed psychopath lists everywhere.
in a year where escapism became a mandatory staple of television, netflix's underrated love & anarchy proved coats still had a certain je ne sais quoi. while sofie's coats might not jump off the screen with emerald green or red threading, they are paired well with a character and the development (or not) that ultimately takes place after an entire season. and unlike the undoing, the coats in love & anarchy could quite possibly carry a scene all by their lonesome.
forget modern-day crime dramas and give me jessica fletcher. thanks to an abundance of reruns available on cable or amazon prime, murder she wrote has some of the most iconic costumes, including but not limited to fletcher's impeccable outerwear choices. marvel at '80s v-neck sweaters under men's coats, windbreakers with a plethora of colors or nautical rain jackets that put the gorton's fisherman in his place.
it's entirely possible to create a compelling crime show featuring standout coats without actually having to discuss said coats. twitter didn't go apeshit over the outerwear sported by alia shawkat, john early or meredith hagner, but it should have. the series takes place over various seasons but each coat perfectly encapsulates each ridiculous and over-the-top character without talking it to death.
″frasier did more for trench coats than the undoing ever could for its apparel. thanks to the rainy setting of seattle, frasier and his counterparts made trench coats stylish, with or without interior burberry branding. frasier might not strike audiences as tv's most fashion-forward show, but next time you watch, pay attention to the countless beige drappering going on between the psychologist, his brother and the rest of the gang.
6. the mary tyler moore show
it's hardly a secret that i was adopted as a baby and quite frankly, there's absolutely no reason it should be. as i've grown, i've watched the conversation and perceptions about adopted kids and families shift, but nothing has quite captured the truth, both the good and the ugly, of adoption like the film lion. it's an honest look at adoption and the not uncommon feelings surrounding identity that come up for many people. without getting on a soapbox, the film stands up to some commonly held misperceptions about adoption, the stigma many families deal with and supports the often life changing impact it can have. when it comes down to it, lion is a story of love and family, and the idea that we are shaped by both our environment and our dna.
if you're not already familiar, lion is the true story of saroo brierley, who at 5 years old gets lost on a train, ending up on the streets of calcutta before ultimately being adopted by an australian couple. fast forward 25 years later, saroo uses google earth, when it was still a new technology to try to find his birth home.
the story alone is incredible, but the cast is simply remarkable in their portrayals -- and if you're anything like me, they'll have you sobbing through an entire box of tissues. this film is an emotional journey boosted by the gorgeous landscapes of india and australia, and no surprise that i noticed the music, which ties together the longing, heart wrenching, and joyous moments throughout.
when it comes down to it, 'lion' is a story of love and family, and the idea that we are shaped by both our environment and our dna.
dev patel plays saroo as an adult struggling with his identity, something i've found to be an experience every adopted kid feels at one point in their lives or another. the results of his search are beyond belief, but it's his journey that resonated most strongly with my own experience. on the one hand, you share the unconditional love for your parents that they have for you, not to mention eternal gratitude for the life they've given you. but as saroo shows, there's often a lingering thought about where you came from. we all yearn for our truth; who we are, where we come from, maybe where we get certain quirks or talents (for me i long wondered where my voice came from since my mother very well knows it was not from her). but finding those truths is the most personal of journeys, coming to each of us at different times and in different ways. on top of that, there's always a part of you that worries this is somehow a betrayal as if your parents and your life are not enough.
lion expertly navigates those thoughts. the movie gives you so much time in india, giving you a complete sense of saroo's life and family there. as an adult he holds on to those memories, but also can't bring himself to open up to that part of his identity until it nearly paralyzes and destroys his life.
i can honestly say being adopted was one of the best things to ever happen to me. it was never something that was hidden from me and it is not something i have ever been ashamed of.
nicole kidman who plays saroo's adoptive mother, sue, made my heart break. nicole herself is part of the community of adoptive mothers and it so clearly impacts her performance in this film. she simply nails it. she is the image of an understanding parent, whose love has no limits. in one scene, she explains to saroo that the children she and her husband brought into their lives enriched it beyond words; that they chose him. in a way, she gives saroo permission to search, taking away the guilt because at the end of the day, she will always be his mother.
i can honestly say being adopted was one of the best things to ever happen to me. it was never something that was hidden from me and it is not something i have ever been ashamed of. i recognize how fortunate i am to have parents who love and support me unconditionally. the fact that they are not my biological parents does not change the fact that they are simply, my parents.
not everyone can say that, but i count myself lucky to have a birth mother who loved me enough to know she wasn't ready to be a mom. i'm lucky that i have wonderful parents who chose me. i often say adoption is a full-circle blessing and i truly believe it. adopted children were not abandoned, we were chosen. that is one of the core messages of lion, serving as a beautiful reminder that love knows no boundaries.
hang on, you there, packing up the christmas lights, dismantling the tree, boxing up the crèche with its cast of characters and that long-tailed star. christmas is not over. sure, come december 26th, it may have been all over for the little drummer boy, bing crosby, and the nutcracker; but not quite for christmas. the wise men are just now arriving. and those magi from the east, with their three auspicious gifts, are not simply late to the party. they inaugurate a whole new thing: public acknowledgment by the world's powers, of a radically new kind of rule. they're not the only ones who notice (cue the soundtrack for the dastardly villain).
what gets me now, thinking as i have been about environmental issues in jesus-ish terms, is how relevant the contrast between the wise men and herod is still today.
the christmas story, as relayed in the bible, takes a couple different tellings. luke's includes the birth with shepherds and angels; matthew gives us the wise men... and herod. the christian calendar varies across denominations, but for most, christmas ends only with epiphany (manifestation), twelve days (yes, pear-tree-partridges and all) afterward: january 6. but this is not about church traditions. it's about a striking contrast between two ways that the rich and powerful recognize something greater than themselves, something radically free with its own incorruptible rules and startlingly sublime.
first, there's a qualitative difference between the cast of characters - between humility and arrogance, the expansive and the narrow, courage and fear. ancient magi were defined by their great learning - wise men whose quest for understanding then as now was the ceaselessly diligent work of a humbling sort that not only expands one's interests beyond one's immediate and personal but also enriches beyond the material. there's nothing of this in herod, the local king, only a narrow desperation to hang on to his power.
herod was full of bluster and deeply afraid. in his power and riches, he feared that this newborn demand for justice, peace, respect, and love would compromise his might and threaten his bottom line. herod sees the newborn not for adoration and joy, but as a terrible danger to be killed as quickly as possible. while herod was ruled by fear and sought to take - through an arrogant and selfish greed, life itself - the magi, moved by adoration and joy, gave. these foreigners were people of wealth and privilege, powerful in their own right. out of those qualities, they recognized something in the one newborn worthy of respect. they gave.
in a recent experiment of the imagination (god of earth: discovering a radically ecological christianity), i asked what happens if the jesus of christian theology (of reconciliation, fierce demands, love, and life itself) were not limited to the guy of 2,000 years ago but were also realized - made real, incarnate - in the nonhuman natural world around us? i called this jesus god of earth and tracked that question through the church year, since those are moments that theologically define jesus. stumbling into this season, i couldn't help but notice: the three wise men and herod model two very different ways to confront the beauty and demands of our nonhuman natural world inextricably bound up as they are with justice and peace.
recognizing the god of earth means nothing less than an end to the world's business as usual. there is great promise - prosperity, peace, even joy - in such recognition, but the unwise powerful cannot see this and would rather kill all semblance of the sublime than risk their bottom line. the significance of the god of earth with her demand for environmental wisdom and justice complicates in inconvenient ways the business of some of the rich and powerful. some, because remember the magi who came, and out of the dignity of their station, recognized with deference and adoration what was holy among them.
during the season of epiphany, our nation will undergo a marked change in leadership. in a democracy, a system in which each of us, whether or not we individually possess great wealth or power, can affect the course of our communities and country, we do well to consider these two ways, then tirelessly choose the better and urge our leaders to do the same. so, you can pack up that christmas stuff now. it's time to attend to the public implications of an invitation to be for justice and peace.
up until this past week, i liked to refer to myself as a recovering home-schooler. i loved home-schooling my children, the way we love anything that stretches and exhausts and betters us, but i had come to accept that it would no longer be part of our journey.
we initially chose home-schooling in a bid for increased freedom and individualized learning, which worked ― some days better than others ― until i alone could no longer meet their needs. just this past fall we made the difficult decision to enroll them all in real school. the irony that the year we put our kids in school just happens to be the same year that the entire world started home-schooling is not lost on me.
now, i, along with millions of other parents across the nation, ready my home school and slog through the ups and downs of distance learning amidst the covid-19 outbreak. many moms and dads are navigating this new reality while at the same time balancing the demands of a full-time job and attempting to parent through an exceptionally volatile and potentially traumatic worldwide crisis.
having taught my four children for three crazy, wonderful, tiring years, i understand the anxiety that accompanies this new normal and the upheaval wrought by a drastic change in circumstances.
given that, i'd like to share my personal home-schooling thoughts and experiences in the hope that some may find them helpful. please know that my perspective is shaped by my failures as much as, if not more than, my successes.
why? you don't need to. also, you can't. i have seen all of those amazing, pinterest-worthy daily schedules circulating on instagram and facebook. yes, they are beautiful and inspiring, but they are also wildly impractical.
when we first started home-schooling four years ago, i did my very best to replicate the school environment. our days were planned down to the minute, including bathroom breaks. it lasted exactly one week and we all cried. every. single. day. it was a disaster.
instead of a schedule, try to create a gentle, flexible routine. some school days will start at 8 a.m. and some days will start at 10 ― because you have a meeting or it's a beautiful morning to play outside or the kids are exhausted. none of that matters.
however, when you do start your day of learning, try to start the same way as often as you can. it could be with a prayer, a reading or a dance party ― anything to help signal the beginning of learning time.
let your routine reflect your priorities.
understand that something will fall through the cracks nearly every day. figure out what is most critical to the success of your family and work backward from there.
our first subject of the day was always math. i did this for two reasons. one, i wanted to be sure that math was practiced daily and if everything else went off the rails, i knew this was checked off the list. two, i had the most mental capacity and patience to help with challenging problems at the beginning of the school day. i am fried after two or three hours of teaching, so i oriented our routine in levels of decreasing mental output (at least for me).
learn to pivot ― a lot.
flexibility is 100% the key to staying sane as a home-schooling parent. when i initially hit roadblocks in teaching, my instinct was always to push through ― whether it was with a frustrated kid, an assignment that was wonky or a concept that wasn't landing. fyi, things usually just got worse.
pushing through is almost never the answer in home-schooling. if something isn't working, there is usually a reason and, most of the time, there is a better solution. i have never regretted hitting the reset button by taking a break, ditching the assignment or switching my approach.
we are blessed to have the guidance and support of the amazing teachers at our kids' schools and for that, i am so, so grateful. however, knowing that this is all new to them, there are bound to be bumps in the road. new concepts and certain curriculums may not translate as readily to an online format as we all hope. your kiddo may resist a new teaching style or may not assimilate information in this new fashion. all of this is ok. it just means that we need to put on our flexible pants and give everyone all of the grace ― especially ourselves.
focus on your relationship, not the work at hand.
this is easier said than done and takes lots of practice and self-regulation. it is very easy to get caught up in a moment of frustration or anger, especially with all the pressures we have right now. expect to apologize ― a lot.
during our first year of home-schooling, i apologized on the daily, usually more than once. when possible, remind yourself that you are the teacher for this brief (we hope) window, but you have an opportunity to positively impact your relationship with your child for a lifetime.
so, be kind. give everyone credit for showing up and remember the only thing they really must know right this moment is that they are loved.
you can do this. you can teach your child and support their learning. it will be messy and challenging and there may be days when you wonder if your child needs far more than you can offer.
in those times, please know that you are uniquely equipped to guide your child through this because you are their parent. you come to the table with a set of skills that includes an intimate knowledge of what makes your kiddo tick and a dedication to their success far beyond the chaos of this moment. use all of this to your advantage.

toronto — canada is already taking the right steps to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, so there is no need to change things now that the world health organization has declared a global emergency over the outbreak, federal health minister patty hajdu said thursday.
the world health organization's global emergency status is really ... about helping countries that do not have the same level of sophistication as canada, or perhaps the united states, to protect their citizens if in fact they have a citizen who returns from china who is ill, or has been close to someone who has returned from china who is ill, hajdu told reporters in ottawa.
you know this has been working very well in canada, because we have actually been able to detect cases very quickly, support those people to get better and prevent the spread of disease, she said. and what the world health organization is saying is that we've got to make sure that other countries can do that as well, because it is in the interest of world health that we support everyone in this process.
cole burston via getty images dr. david williams, the chief medical officer of ontario, listens to press questions during a press briefing on the coronavirus at queen's park on jan. 27, 2020, in toronto.
the world health organization declared the outbreak, which was sparked by a new virus in china that has been exported to more than a dozen countries, as a global emergency thursday. the un health agency defines an international emergency as an extraordinary event that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated response.
though many people experience only mild symptoms from the virus, china has reported more than 7,800 cases, including 170 deaths.
hajdu stressed the need — and the responsibility — to remain calm.
i think that anything that we are doing as politicians or leaders or members of the media that will create a sense of anxiety or panic is actually a dangerous road to travel down, she said.
cole burston via getty images dr. barbara yaffe, ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, listens during a press briefing on the coronavirus at queen's park.
earlier thursday, ontario's chief medical officer of health said the relatively low number of cases here is reassuring, even though it is still early days in dealing with the virus.
there are three confirmed cases of the virus in canada — two in ontario and one in british columbia — and all are linked to recent travel in china.
dr. david williams and ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, dr. barbara yaffe, held a briefing on the new virus thursday and said there are no new presumptive or confirmed cases in ontario. williams said he would be much more concerned at this point if the province had already seen around seven to 10 cases.
this is reassuring in a way, but not that we're going to sit back and coast, he said. the system is working. we're investigating. individuals of concern have self-reported, are coming forward and we haven't seen ones that out of the blue show up already quite ill and infected. we're not seeing that yet, but it's still early days.
there are 27 cases currently under investigation in the province, and 38 people have already been tested and cleared.
williams said the coronavirus does not seem to be much different from regular influenza in terms of transmissibility, and evidence suggests it is not transmissible when a person is not feeling symptoms.
the two ontario cases are a husband and wife, and since they had both travelled to the affected area in china, it's unclear whether the woman — as the second case — got it in wuhan or from her husband.
asked about the novel virus thursday afternoon, prime minister justin trudeau warned against stigmatizing the chinese-canadian community.
we've seen too many instances of unreasonable fears being spread either on the internet or in other ways. we need to know this is a time for canadians — all canadians, including canadians of chinese origin — to pull together and to lean on each other, trudeau told reporters in brampton, ont.

meanwhile, quebec has no confirmed cases of the new virus, and the chances of its being transmitted to the community are considered low, the province's director of public health said thursday.
dr. horacio arruda warned the public against wearing masks, which he said do not constitute, by science, a useful tool for the general population in quebec, even in the context of a coronavirus outbreak. instead, he suggested people practice respiratory hygiene by washing their hands and covering their mouths when sneezing or coughing.
if people have respiratory symptoms and have to go out in public, wearing a mask can help prevent transmission, yaffe said, but it is not useful for the general population.
anybody who's feeling well, wearing a mask is not going to do anything, she said. in fact, it might give them a false sense of security.
this report by the canadian press was first published jan. 30, 2020.
its january, and lots of us have been talking about what happened over the recent holidays, or, at least, listening to others doing so. maybe like me, you've heard (or said) something like, i thought it (xmas, new year's, a trip etc.) was going to be great, but then _______ (fill-in-the-blank) did or said ________ (fill-in-the-blank) just like always, and i couldn't wait for it to be over.
seems like sentiment is pretty obvious, but actually, i'd argue that most of us are missing the point.
when we consistently project the past into our current experiences, we rob ourselves and everyone around us of the chance to be present, now. it also means we condemn the future to be a continuation of the past. sounds harsh, huh? maybe it is. but it's true, and this destructive way to thinking is ubiquitous.
at some point, we all have the chance to accept things in our lives simply as they are. this includes our own human failings, the mistakes and foibles of those we love, the tragedies we've survived and, yes, the suffering we've somehow caused. the past is past. all of it. whatever happened back then, happened already. yes, it brings us to where we are in our lives now, but we can't really be who we are right now if we let the past define us. this means, we miss out on just about everything.
over the holidays, did you encounter any of these (or similar) scenarios:
your loved one was more interested in reliving past failures than noticing how you've changed your present perspective?
you were so busy being angry at a perceived slight from the past that you lost the fleeting chance to make a precious connection?
you were so involved with your own personal history that you left no room for anyone else's story, and lost the possibility on any authentic human exchange?
your version and interpretation of another person's past actions precluded you from experiencing any possibility of a different interaction, and so you don't actually know what might have happened... had you let it?
despite all your hopes for a better experience, relationship, reunion (etc.) nothing changes, because deep down you can't imagine what or how change could actually be?
do i sound angry? i am. but it's a righteous anger for all those who strive to show up in the current moment, fresh, carrying opportunity, vulnerable... and who are slapped hard in the face with other people's old hurts and hatreds.
let me be clear, i am not diminishing or dismissing anything: tragic or triumphant, painful or ecstatic. we are always accountable for our actions (constructive and destructive), and yes even our unspoken thoughts. there's no undoing what's already been done - but there is no need to continue redoing it (whatever it is)... especially when it causes suffering.
the bottom line is simple: this instant, right now, is all we can ever really have. this is the lesson of mindfulness: to be compassionate, aware and open. it is also the wisdom of all the world's great wisdom traditions.
try to hold your knowledge of the past in one hand, but allow the other to open so you invite the present and touch what's here, now. this stance bridges the present and future, because we reach out open-handed.
in contrast, if you clench your fists out of a pain-filled past, you will become fatigued with living or worse, you will strike someone in the present and cause more pain. or, if you forever hold back, you can never touch what's right here. neither of these options work. we all know this, but few of us dare to look at our own hands
i know you just want to get through this time. but i want you to woo this time. don't rush. take your time because nothing that is yours is a matter of harried timing. it's going to work out. it always does in its own inexplicable way. and everything occurs in its own right hour; you simply can't breach the laws of reality.
i am proud of you. you will make all the decisions that are right for you. and you will make new ones on the spot with new information. as you create this life, you will have a thousand chances. this isn't a multiple-choice exam in which you can fail. take your time. slog through whatever you need to go through in order to grow, even if it feels like cement. you are being given this chance. and it is a worthy one, followed by nothing but more avenues for your good. there is no scarcity of opportunity.
discover by following your desire, even if that desire is faint or seems as likely as a chocolate factory, or maybe the easter bunny himself, in the middle of the desert. it's real. it's there for a reason. use desire as a compass, and do not concern yourself with how it could ever happen. if you really want to grow and experience all that life can offer you, let go of calculation. this is a path of revelation. it's the journey of becoming who you did not know you could become.
the censoring voice that tells you that you only have one chance to get this right is a voice of smallness and powerlessness. it's got sour dinosaur breath—it's of the old regime. it's the voice of limitation, asking you to deny your birthright of choice and possibility. it only has one agenda, the agenda to make you wrong. really, do you think any voice is protecting you by shaming and threatening you? any advice that limits your spirit is not advice. it's damnation.
i am here to tell you that you are made of astonishment. you are finding your way, even when you are losing it. you may feel as though you're struggling or lost. you may ache for resolution, because it's human nature to want to skip steps and watch netflix. but here's what i want you to know. it is working out right now. that's the nature of life. it works out. a spiritual journey happens when we open our eyes to see it this way, no matter what. you are learning to tune in to the signal that will take you all the way; you are learning to listen to nothing in this life but that which strengthens you.
so, will you—right now—thank yourself for everything, everything, everything, and i mean everything, past, present, and to come, no matter what? now, that's a viable prayer. you can decide right now how you will view this time of uncertainty. you may not be able to choose different circumstances. but you can choose to thrive in every circumstance. this isn't positive thinking. this is positive incarnation. it's your minutes on earth. it's your melody. and it's your choice how you play the song.
besides, there are an exponential number of outcomes that will help you thrive. there is no outcome that will not gift you. you bring the light with you. you're the homecoming queen or king thinking you need to win the school's election. you've already won. you're already chosen. it's already done. the whole world is simply waiting for you to choose yourself and the perspective that most sets you free. it will wait forever with bated breath. you are that valuable and necessary. we all are.
no matter where you find yourself, you can always choose again. as long as you have breath, you can start over. there is no complexity except in the mind. there is only this simple moment. there is no promise in the distance. the promise is here. it's everywhere. if you are feeling lack, it is because you are not appreciating yourself and your journey. you are not forgiving yourself for things you imagine you should have done or been.
choose to be here. know that this moment in your life has a purpose and that this purpose is essential to your deepest happiness. this is a choice of mental focus that activates the power of the mystery. you're not thwarted or in a maze. you will be in amazement when you realize your freedom to choose how extraordinary you truly are.
do take in the privilege of being alive and having choices, drama and desires. there are those who are dying right now. they would give anything to be where you are.
and there are others who would give anything to have your problems. they ache to have the chance you have right now. and there are others, still, who are fondly looking back on times in their lives when they stood where you stand right now. the times you are trying to run from, some say, were the best in all their lives.
acknowledge your courage. it is not easy to be born strong and to crave higher ground. you may feel as though you're lacking. but truly, it's because you're burning to be who you really are. you have a bird of passage within you. you would never be happy at the end of your days having played it bulletproof safe, never knowing where your expression could have gone—especially because you do know deep down where the power of love is meant to take you.
of course you're frightened—but you didn't come into this lifetime to avoid desire and risk and get to the finish line without a smudge, a scar or a difference in your point of view. you want to have put everything into it. you won't look back and wish you'd given up. you won't wish you'd sat it out and watched others on television live fascinating lives. you wanted to get wet. you wanted to know. you did know.
yes, dear one, it's good to be afraid. it's important that you're living a life that matters.
according to a new gallup report released on wednesday, women in committed heterosexual relationships are as likely as their partners to work outside the home, and yet they're still more likely to do more work at home, too. women are more likely to clean the house, prepare meals and care for children on a daily basis, gallup said. and women report they're doing more of the cognitive household stuff as well, like anticipating needs (e.g., buying and switching out clothing) and making decisions.
of course, being the so-called default parent isn't really a problem unless it's a problem for the person doing all that work, whether they're in a same-sex relationship, divorced co-parents, or something else. but when the weight of it all — the scheduling of doctor's appointments and playdates, the cooking, the remembering which kid likes what and who has a big math project due tomorrow, and on and on — begins to crush one parent, it's time for a change.
so how do you start offloading some of your emotional labor as a parent? and how do you make big changes without starting big fights? here are five expert tips on making it happen.
one note: emotional labor has been a big buzzword in recent years, and there's some confusion about what it actually means. some people use it to refer broadly to the silent, unpaid work done to keep households and families humming. others — including the sociologist who coined the term — say we should stick more to its original meaning of needing to suppress your emotions while doing your paid job. we're using it pretty loosely and interchangeably here with the idea of being the default parent.
1. to start, ditch the idea of a 50/50 partnership.
conversations around fairness at home are often predicated on the idea that a 50/50 split is fair. and anything short of that kind of perfect split means one parent is being saddled with too much. but eve rodsky, a lawyer, mother and author of fair play — a book that helps couples divvy up domestic responsibilities — says 50/50 is basically bs.
what is fair is not always equal, and what is equal is not always fair, rodsky told huffpost. throw out 50/50.
if you have, say, 100 different household and child-related tasks that have to get done in any given week, it's hiiiiighly unlikely that one of you will take 50 and the other will take 50, and voila! what you need to do is sit down and proactively divide up tasks, really specifically spelling out what needs to get done and who is going to do it. like: you will own taking out the garbage and i will own getting the kids out the door in the morning.
2. have those conversations about who owns what task when you're calm.
conversations around resentment and domestic life tend to happen in the heat of the moment, says rachel sussman, a new york-based therapist and author of the breakup bible: the smart woman's guide to healing from a breakup or divorce. but that's the worst time and way to do it.
you definitely want to approach it when you're both calm, and you want to do it as soon as you realize you've started building up feelings of resentment, sussman said.
try not to frame your points as complaints. instead, frame them as observations — like, hey, i've noticed that i am doing a lot more of xyz and it is taking a lot out of me. and i'm wondering if you have noticed that too? i statements instead of you statements can also be helpful, according to sussman.
rodsky recommends weekly 20-minute check-ins. you can communicate about your domestic life, she said. you can give feedback to each other when emotions are low and cognition is high. maybe you do it over tacos and tequila, rodsky said. maybe it's while you take a run together, or are just sitting for a few minutes on the couch at home. just set a time and commit to it.
ownership of a particular task means remembering it, planning for it, then following through — without needing to be reminded.
3. establish that if you own a task, you own it from start to finish.
having to remind your partner to do something doesn't take that something off your list. it adds to it, rodsky wrote in fair play. which is why it's so important that when you divvy up tasks again, you set the ground rule that ownership of a particular task means remembering it, planning for it, then following through — without needing to be reminded.
too often, conflict arises when the partner who supposedly owns a task steps in only at the execution phase, foisting all of the mental load on the default parent. so if it's your job to bring oranges for halftime at your kid's soccer game, then it's on you to remember when the game is. it's on you to plan when you're going to get the oranges and get them ready without asking for guidance on how many or how they should be cut or transported to the game. and it's on you to make sure they're actually there on time — without your partner checking in on you.
4. embrace a minimum standard of care.
couples often argue not just about what needs to get done, but also how it should be done — as if there is some kind of universal standard. but the way you'd do something is not necessarily the right way. nor should partners be let off the hook for taking on a task, then doing a truly crappy job at it.
if you're going to try and swap tasks or lessen your load, it's important to first agree to what rodsky calls a minimum standard of care for that particular act. would a reasonable person, under similar circumstances, do the task in roughly the same way as you? she asks. if yes, great! you've met the minimum standard of care. if not, you haven't really done it.

it might be hard to tell from reading my column, but i love sports. too much, even. it's why i spend so much of my time watching, thinking, writing about and critiquing them. but i take a tough love approach. sports are a reflection of our greater culture and so, as with any part of our culture, they are rife with problems like racism, homophobia and transphobia, sexism, classism, etc.
at the same time, the focus on sports in our society means they can be a site where we work on some of these problems. changes on the field, court or pitch can reverberate back into society for the better. that is why it is important that those of us who love sports do not do so uncritically.
and so, at this time in the calendar year when we look ahead and make wishes for our lives that we then hope to implement, here is what i hope sports does better in 2019:
it's time to pay college players
it's time to pay college athletes for their work. amateurism does not create parity in sport. it is not a benefit to the student-athletes. it is exploitative at its core and so is not the feel-good moral or ethical position so many people wish it to be.
the ncaa rakes in over a billion dollars (that's with a b!) every year. coaches of big-time college sports make millions of dollars (with additional bonuses when their players do well on the field or in the classroom), which connecticut sen. chris murphy called immoral late last year.
people who oppose the idea of paying student-athletes (a group that just so happens to be mainly white people) argue that these kids are getting free college educations and those are very expensive these days, so they don't deserve any additional compensation. but this comes with caveats, too. not only do some schools create paper classes (classes that exist only on paper) to keep student-athletes eligible to play, but black student-athletes, who make up the majority of the teams that actually generate revenue for their schools, are less likely than their white counterparts or other black students at their schools to obtain degrees.
so what exactly are they really getting out of their free labor?
associated press clemson defensive lineman christian wilkins kisses the trophy after winning the championship monday night.
victoria jackson, a sports historian at arizona state university and a former ncaa champion runner, argues that giving student-athletes lifetime scholarships ― allowing them to complete their degree at any time ― would, in part, address this problem and would finally, finally, finally acknowledge that the current system of going to school while playing a sport on a professional level is a bad one.
journalist patrick hruby has made a strong case that the answer is to simply pay the players. we live in a capitalistic society that has figured out how to pay people in a whole host of other scenarios. certainly we can figure this one out, too.
but if you need incremental change, follow the olympic model of allowing players to make money off their own likenesses, give them lifelong health insurance to compensate them for the long-term detriments to their bodies and brains, or put a salary cap on the whole thing.
there are a lot of ideas here. let's start implementing them.
it's time to really invest in women's sports
my hope this year is that not only will more fans turn up in person and even more watch/stream women's games, but that sports media will make more space for them. 2019 is the year of the women's world cup, and so a perfect time to focus on embracing women's sports.
we are already in the middle of an exciting women's collegiate basketball season. there's never been more parity in the game. the university of connecticut looked mortal last week when they lost at baylor 68-57, the huskies' first regular-season loss since november 2014, snapping a 126-game streak. and that parity feeds up to a stacked wnba, which saw one of its strongest rookie classes ever last year, plus a season where postseason slots were decided in the final games of the regular season and where the semifinal matchups both went to five games in their best-of-five series. this can only mean great things for the 2019 season.
more sports fans like me must speak up and hold their favorite teams and players accountable. the more of us there are, the more rapidly things will change.
unfortunately, the ncaa volleyball season is over but put it on your calendar now to check it out in the fall.
i also want leagues and organizations to invest more resources throughout those communities and countries where girls and women have poor or simply less access to sport. i will die on this hill of pushing women's sports and i invite you onto the hill with me in 2019.
it's time to be better fans
while there are plenty of other things i could wish for this year (i.e., sports teams and related organizations improving their response to reports of gendered violence, or sports media diversifying who covers this beat and which teams or stories they follow), i have one last big hope ― this one directed at other fans. we, as a group, gotta do better.
look, i know that sports would be more fun if you never had to think about its seedy underbelly of sexual abuse, domestic violence, wage disparity, racism, homophobic taunts, terrible team names, i could go on. but for so many of us, there's no choice. the issues we face in our everyday lives also appear on the field, pitch or court.
the best way to deal with this is not to ignore it; these problems and those advocating for change are not going away. ignoring them simply leaves you morally bankrupt in pursuit of selfish enjoyment.
so, for 2019, i propose that you embrace being the loud-mouth fan in the stands and in life. i want more sports fans like me to speak up and hold their favorite teams and players accountable. the more of us there are, the more rapidly things will change. let's make sports more and more enjoyable for more and more people, and let's do it sooner rather than later.
here's to 2019 and loving sports even more than we do now!

chances are, you throw compliments around pretty freely on any given day. maybe you like a co-worker's shoes, or a friend's particularly adorable photo on instagram. but what we take for granted is the lasting effect a compliment can have on someone's ideas about self-love.
covet, a fashion-focused video game in which users complete style challenges, debuted 50 new digital models of all different sizes, shapes, heights, skin colors and facial features on tuesday. in conjunction with the launch, covet has released a video titled a beautiful perspective: how compliments can empower.
covet covet's new model options for its style challenges.
in the video, three covet users are interviewed about their own views of themselves and the insecurities they face ― and it's all too familiar to anyone who owns a mirror.
it takes more than a dress or a different hairstyle to change the way you feel about yourself, samantha said.
but after receiving makeovers, the three women are introduced to three other women who, according to the video, got to know them and shared what they saw.
slowly but surely, you can see the women's attitudes and emotions changing as they hear things like, you're very beautiful and you really do brighten the room up. it is a truly beautiful shift that, by the end, has you wanting to compliment just about everyone ― which it then challenges us all to do.
when joelle casteix heard pope francis accuse sex abuse victims in chile of slander, the pontiff's words hit close to home.
francis told reporters thursday that he hasn't seen any convincing evidence against chile's bishop juan barros madrid, whom victims claim protected a pedophile priest.
the day someone brings me proof against bishop barros, then i will talk, francis said during a papal trip to chile, according to the new york times. but there is not one single piece of evidence. it is all slander. is that clear?
casteix, a california native and advocate for abuse victims, knows what it's like to share a vulnerable story of sexual abuse and to have that story questioned. she is herself a survivor of abuse within the roman catholic church. from 1986 to 1988, she was abused by a choir director at santa ana's mater dei high school, in the roman catholic diocese of orange. by the time the abuse ended, she said, the teacher had left her pregnant and with a sexually transmitted disease. she was only 17.
it was proof of what she'd been saying all along ― that church officials knew about abuse taking place in the diocese and didn't do enough to protect victims.
given this history with the church, it's not hard to understand why casteix's voice sharpened as she spoke to huffpost about francis' attack on abuse victims in chile.
every abuser says to his victim: you have no proof. no one is going to believe you, said castiex, now an activist with survivors network of those abused by priests (snap). what pope francis did was put himself in the abuser's seat, in the power position.
what he's doing is revictimizing every single child victim and putting himself in the abuser's shoes.

unabashed support for a controversial bishop
francis' comments about barros came at the end of a papal trip to chile that was already fraught with tensions.
chilean abuse victims and their allies have been upset about the pope's continued defense of barros. several victims claim that barros covered up and, in some instances, observed abuse carried out by his mentor, rev. fernando karadima.
the vatican convicted karadima of abusing teenage boys in 2011 and sent him to live a cloistered life of penitence and prayer in a chilean convent. a judge found the allegations against karadima to be truthful and reliable but dismissed a criminal case against the priest because the statute of limitations had expired.
barros denied having any knowledge of karadima's abusive actions ― and it appears that francis still believes him.

in 2015, the pope appointed barros as bishop of osorno, in southern chile. politicians and even some church leaders in the country vocally opposed the move and called for barros to resign.
that same year, francis was captured on video telling a group of tourists at vatican city that people in osorno who protested barros' appointment were dumb and judging a bishop without any proof.
francis' trip to chile this week was marred by street protests and the burning of nearly a dozen churches as people voiced frustration with how the church is handling the clergy sex abuse scandal.
on tuesday, francis expressed pain and shame over the abuse scandal and begged for victims' forgiveness. he met and reportedly wept with chilean survivors of abuse, the associated press reported.
but he has also continued to show support for barros. the new york times reported that the bishop participated in the pope's ceremonies in the cities of santiago, iquique and temuco.
barros told reporters that the pope offered him words of support and affection during the visit.

words versus action on preventing sexual abuse
in the past, francis has shown signs that he's willing and ready to take serious steps to confront the problem of sexual abuse in the church. still, some victims' advocates are worried that the vatican is not moving quickly to keep kids safe.
in december 2013, victims' groups rejoiced when francis decided to assemble a vatican committee dedicated solely to fighting child sex abuse in the church. the group, the pontifical commission for the protection of minors, initially included two survivors of clergy sex abuse.
in 2017, one of those survivors, irish activist marie collins, announced that she was stepping down out of frustration with vatican bureaucracy. in an opinion piece for the national catholic reporter, collins wrote about facing a number of stumbling blocks, including a lack of resources and the resistance of some in the vatican curia toward implementing the commission's recommendations.
the last straw for her was the refusal of a group at the vatican to ensure that all letters from victims received a response.
i find it impossible to listen to public statements about the deep concern in the church for the care of those whose lives have been blighted by abuse, yet to watch privately as a congregation in the vatican refuses to even acknowledge their letters! collins wrote last march. it is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.
tiziana fabi via getty images irish activist marie collins attends a news conference on may 3, 2014, at the vatican. she criticized the vatican's fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.
in december, all of the commission members' terms formally expired and the initiative's future is unclear.
secular groups have also delved into the problem of sexual abuse in the catholic church. in december, the australian government concluded an extensive, multi-year inquiry into sexual abuse of children in the country. the commission's final report found that 59 percent of the more than 8,000 survivors interviewed said they were sexually abused in an institution managed by a religious organization. about 62 percent of that group said that the institution was managed by the catholic church.
the commission came up with a number of recommendations for the church. it urged the church to end the secrecy of the confessional when it prevents or discourages compliance with mandatory reporting laws. the commission also asked the church to rethink the requirement of priestly celibacy, which, while not a direct cause, elevated the risk of abuse.
melbourne's archbishop has dismissed both of those recommendations, since they involve changes to longstanding church tradition.
but kieran tapsell, a retired civil lawyer who submitted a paper on canon law to the commission, believes there are many other recommendations the commission made that could be put into practice ― such as ensuring there's no statute of limitations for canonical trials and requiring vatican congregations and courts to publish reasons for their disciplinary decisions.
″[these] recommendations had more to do with church law and practice, and could be more easily implemented, if church leadership is willing to take up this challenge, tapsell wrote in an analysis for the national catholic reporter.
but, as demonstrated in chile, much of that change starts with the pope.
the president of the chilean bishops' conference, monsignor santiago silva, told the new york times on friday that it would continue to support barros ― trusting in francis' opinion of the bishop.
the pope told us what he wants, and he wants monsignor barros to continue, silva said.

backlash in chile and across the globe
in chile and around the world, francis' remarks in defense of barros have caused outrage among survivors of clergy abuse.
juan carlos cruz, one of karadima's most vocal victims, was particularly unnerved by francis' demand for proof that barros had been complicit in the abuse.
as if i could have taken a selfie or photo while karadima abused me and others with juan barros standing next to him watching everything, cruz wrote on twitter, according to a bbc translation.
these people are absolutely crazy, and [the pope] is talking about reparation to the victims. nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.
patrick noaker, a lawyer who has represented dozens survivors of sexual abuse in minnesota, said that cruz's testimony appears to him to be extremely powerful. that's because when it comes to child sexual abuse, there is rarely evidence outside the testimony of the victim.
francis' defense of barros is a reminder to noaker that bishops are the princes of the catholic church, and they are protected at all cost.
the statement by the pope reveals a hard-liner position that he will protect bishops over children, he told huffpost in an email. this will discourage survivors of sexual abuse from reporting their abuse because they will not have photographs or other evidence of the abuse outside of their testimony.
other advocates for abuse survivors have the same fear that victims will be afraid to come forward with their stories. anne barrett doyle, co-director of the online database bishopaccountability.org, called francis' attack on the chilean sex abuse survivors a stunning setback.
the burden of proof here rests with the church, not with victims ― and especially not with victims whose veracity already has been affirmed, doyle said in a statement. exhaustive investigations by both church and civil authorities proved the allegations of juan carlos cruz [and others] in regards to karadima. a reasonable person would consider that they are telling the truth about barros also.
who knows how many victims now will decide to stay hidden, for fear they too will be attacked as slanderers? she added.
david greenwood, a volunteer lawyer with the british advocacy group ministry and clergy sexual abuse survivors, echoed doyle and noaker's concerns.
for the pope to be deliberately confrontational and challenging in this way will prevent survivors coming forward to share their ordeals, greenwood told huffpost in an email.

the church's handling of the abuse scandal in chile has disillusioned many of the country's catholics. a survey by the regional polling firm latinobarometro found that only 42 percent of chilean catholics approved of the job francis is doing, compared with an average of 68 percent for 18 other central and south american countries.
casteix told huffpost that, in her view, there's nothing the pope can do now to prove that his apologies to sex abuse victims are meaningful.
it is as if pope francis took a trip to chile, apologized for abuse, prayed for healing, asked for forgiveness, and then got on his plane and said, 'just kidding.'

natalia vetrova via getty images burn, baby, burn: these are the candles to help chill tf out.
while candles have become much-mocked, last-minute gifts for that person whom you just don't really know that well, the candle market has been, excuse us, burning up in recent years. and if you doubt the power of candles, there's even a national candle association that's been around since 1974.
right now, it seems like folks are (shakily) reaching for their matchbooks and lighters more than ever. gq staffers are igniting incense. coveteur's got a guide to calming candles. even elle has a wax gallery to help you escape.
it's like the summoning circle meme from last year is coming to life, and everyone's just trying to get some respite (while all of our monthly budgets must make room for our ever-expanding candle collection).
the trend of lighting up doesn't seem like it's going to be extinguished soon either, especially as it's tied to the movement for more wellness and self-care. candles are usually cited as stress-relieving, and scents like lemon and lavender might change the mood you're in.

one of the largest grocery chains in the u.s. has decided to end much of its in-house delivery service, outsourcing the work to third-party companies like doordash that rely on independent contractors to drop off food to customers on the cheap.
unions representing workers at albertsons say the chain's decision will end up degrading good delivery jobs by putting the work on a gig model. independent contractors tend to bear many of the costs of employment, providing their own vehicles and covering wear and tear, while forgoing traditional work benefits like health coverage and a retirement fund.
albertsons told huffpost that doordash was one of several third-party companies that the grocer would shift the work toward, to compete in the growing home delivery market more effectively. the company said it's e-commerce business has exploded during the pandemic.
while we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasn't a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration, an albertsons spokesperson said in an email.
while albertsons did not cite the new california law known as proposition 22 for the decision, several major california markets will be impacted by the policy change. prop 22 makes it easier for companies like doordash to classify their drivers as independent contractors.
the change is scheduled to take effect on feb. 27.
the decision by albertsons was first reported by knockla, which said that albertsons chains vons and pavilions would be firing union workers. but albertsons said it would be offering the affected drivers other positions within stores and warehouses, and both albertsons and union representatives said jobs under union contracts would not be impacted by the change.
for all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up. jim araby, ufcw western states council
the united food and commercial workers union condemned the move by albertsons. jim araby, director of ufcw's western states council, said his union represents around 250 drivers in california's bay area who work for albertsons subsidiary safeway. those drivers organized about two years ago and are in the process of securing their first contract; their jobs will not change as a result of the new arrangement at albertsons.
araby said third-party delivery services appeal to companies like albertsons because another company has to worry about the fleet and the logistics of employment: you don't have to maintain the truck, you don't have to worry about accidents and all that goes with that. and the third-party companies ultimately don't have to worry about much of that either, because everyone is using their own cars.
according to araby, both ufcw and the teamsters represent in-house drivers at albertsons, but only a small share of the overall workforce. he said even though union drivers would not be impacted by the change, he believes grocers' increasing reliance on companies like doordash will imperil more in-house jobs over time.

and for all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up, araby said. i think it's an example of corporate greed.
he said his union is considering filing a grievance, believing the change may run afoul of provisions it has bargained related to subcontracting.
albertsons declined to say how many positions would ultimately be eliminated, but that it plan[s] to offer positions to each impacted associate. those who don't accept the transfer may be eligible for severance pay: we will work with them on their individual situation.
the move comes against the backdrop of prop 22. in 2019, california passed a law known as assembly bill 5 making it harder for gig companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. prop 22, which voters passed in november, excluded app-based drivers from the earlier law, protecting the contractor system at companies like uber, lyft and doordash.
those companies spent heavily to get the measure passed. unions and their allies on the left viewed the success of prop 22 as a major setback in their fight with silicon valley and the growth of the contract workforce.
adan alvarez, a spokesperson for teamsters local 396, called the decision by albertsons a natural response to prop 22, now that the gig model is secure in the state among food delivery drivers. his union represents employees working out of albertsons warehouses in southern california. although no teamsters will lose their jobs, he said he expects the new jobs to be less stable than the ones being eliminated.
this is an example of what we predicted. it's giving companies an open door to chip away at employee-based jobs, alvarez said. these [albertsons] employees, they weren't unionized. but they were still employees with wages and benefits.

in november 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless business-as-usual changed. by failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere, they wrote.
former un climate chief christiana figueres and physicist stefan rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. in an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.
humanity is in a horse race with catastrophe. the good news is that we are in the race. but even if we win, it will change our economy beyond recognition.
we have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. back in 2009, stanford scientist dr. mark jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. his solutions project calculated how to do this for every state in the u.s. and many countries. more recently, scholars like christian breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.
stanford professor tony seba argues that not only is the transition to renewables possible, it is inevitable.
in his book clean disruption seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. he focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car.
these innovations, he argues, by delivering renewably powered, electric vehicle transit as a service will be ten times cheaper than current private ownership of internal combustion cars. in the process, the shift to evs will move us to a completely renewable energy system.
he reminds doubters that experts totally underestimated sales of mobile phones. in the 1990s, mckinsey told att to expect 900,000 mobile subscribers by the year 2000. they were off by 108 million. by 2014 there were more mobile phones on earth than the seven billion people, increasing five times faster than humans.
when the kentucky coal museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over
a new solar array goes up in the u.s. every 150 seconds, but can the whole world be renewable by 2030?
why? because the cost of solar is falling rapidly. in october saudi arabia announced the new world record low price in an auction bid: 1.7¢/kwh. when the kentucky coal museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over.
so we can run our society on solar energy, but what if the sun isn't shining or the wind blowing?
storage technology to make renewable energy available 24/7 is only in its infancy as an industry, but its prices are falling, too.
when the aliso canyon natural gas well blew out, spewing 100,000 metric tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the local utility feared it would be unable to keep lights on in southern california. in record time, tesla and others brought online more than 70 megawatts of energy storage at a price cheaper than building a new gas peaking plant, and vastly faster.
in late 2016 the financial times reported that fitch ratings warned: widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry, noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. in the u.s. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.
it endangers the banks, as well: a quarter of all corporate debt, perhaps as much as $3.4 trillion, is related to utility and car company bonds that are tied to fossil fuel use.
anyone doubting this risk must have been sobered when, in september 2017, china announced it was going to phase out internal combustion vehicles. given that china represents a quarter of the global automobile market, this – coupled with india, france, the uk, and norway making similar announcements – is an existential crisis for both the oil and car industries.
about a week after china's announcement, jerry brown, the governor of california, the world's fifth largest economy, asked mary nichols, head of the state's air resources board, whether california could do the same. two days later she said yes. two days later jerry said then we will. that was a friday.
on the monday, general motors, which had reclaimed its coveted status of the world's leading automobile manufacturer on the strength of its bolt electric car, announced that its future is electric. meanwhile, daimler, volkswagen and volvo have committed to electrifying their entire product portfolios.

in november, elon released an all-electric long haul truck, and china announced the launch of the world's first all-electric cargo ship.
we're three for three on seba's predictions. but in seba's scenario it's the autonomous electric vehicle (aev) that drives the real reduction in cost he claims will make the disruption inevitable. are aevs more than just science fiction?
to get the straight story, i talked to tom chi, the head of product experience at google x and one of the designers of the self-driving google car.
within ten years? asked tom. easy. tesla, he said, released its driverless vehicle when it was as safe as a human driven car. remember, hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car crashes. teslas have driven more than 5 billion miles in autonomous mode, en route to the company's 10 billion mile safety proof point. in fact, all teslas are now capable of full autonomous mode. the google car has driven four million real miles, and 2.5 billion simulated miles. gm just announced that it is pivoting its business model to offer autonomous electric vehicle transit as a service by 2019.
does that make it four for four? is tony right?
you decide. but realize that if the evidence laid out here is true, it has profound implications for everything. it will mean the dissolution in value, likely complete loss of the oil, gas, coal, uranium, nuclear, utility, auto industries, the banks that hold the loan paper for all of these companies and the pension funds and insurance companies that are invested in them.
it will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.
consider oil. in 2011, carbon tracker calculated that at least 80 percent of the fossil deposits still in the ground would have to stay in the ground if the world is to avoid warming beyond 2c more that pre-industrial levels.
given that those fossil assets are on the balance sheets of some of the world's wealthiest companies and form the basis of the sovereign wealth funds of many nations around the world, john fullerton of the capital institute predicted that this implied a write-off of at least $20 trillion dollars. in contrast, fullerton warned, the 2008 financial collapse was triggered by the stranding of only $2.7 trillion in mortgage assets.
it appears unwise to have any of your assets in the industries that will be disrupted. bevis longstreth, former securities and exchange commissioner, observed: it is entirely plausible, even predictable, that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.
where does your energy come from? are you dependent on an industry that is at risk? millions of people, communities and cities are going 100 percent renewable.
is your job at risk? companies will either become part of the solution, or they won't be a problem because they won't be around. the emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. will we substitute a universal basic income? will we descend into unimaginable darkness? or will we create a finer future?
either way, we will totally transform the global economy. the crises we face and the inevitabilities of change described here will drive this change.

atlanta (ap) — georgia voters are deciding the balance of power in congress in a pair of high-stakes senate runoff elections that will help determine president-elect joe biden's ability to enact what could be the most progressive governing agenda in generations.
republicans are unified against biden's plans for health care, environmental protection and civil rights, but some fear that outgoing president donald trump's brazen attempts to undermine the integrity of the nation's voting systems may discourage voters in georgia.
at a rally in northwest georgia on the eve of tuesday's runoffs, trump repeatedly declared that the november elections were plagued by fraud that republican officials, including his former attorney general and georgia's elections chief, say did not occur. at the same time, trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for georgia's tuesday contests.
you've got to swarm it tomorrow, trump told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.

democrats must win both of the state's senate elections to gain the senate majority. in that scenario, the senate would be equally divided 50-50 with vice president-elect kamala harris serving as the tie-breaker for democrats.
the democrats secured a narrow house majority and the white house during november's general election.
georgia's january elections, necessary because no senate candidates received a majority of the general-election votes, have been unique for many reasons, not least because the contenders essentially ran as teams, even campaigning together sometimes.

one contest features democrat raphael warnock, who serves as the senior pastor of the atlanta church where slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. grew up and preached. the 51-year-old warnock was raised in public housing and spent most of his adult life preaching in baptist churches.
warnock is facing republican sen. kelly loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the senate less than a year ago by the state's republican governor. she is only the second woman to represent georgia in the senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of warnock's sermons at the historic black church to cast him as extreme. dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.
the other election pits 71-year-old former business executive david perdue, who held the senate seat until his term officially expired on sunday, against democrat jon ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. at just 33 years old, ossoff would be the senate's youngest member if elected. he first rose to national prominence in 2017 when he launched an unsuccessful house special election bid.

even a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't guarantee biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. but if democrats lose even one of tuesday's contests, biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. a republican-controlled senate also would create a rougher path for biden's cabinet picks and judicial nominees.
georgia, the whole nation is looking to you. the power is literally in your hands, biden declared at his own rally in atlanta on monday. one state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.
despite fears among some republicans that trump's baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the two gop candidates strongly support him. perdue on tuesday said that trump would of course deserve credit if the republicans won.
what the president said last night is, even if you are upset about all of that, you've got to stand up with us and fight, perdue told fox & friends. we'll look back on this day if we don't vote and really rue the day that we turned the keys to the kingdom over to the democrats.
loeffler pledged monday to join a small but growing number of gop senators protesting congress' expected certification of biden's victory wednesday.

democrats have hammered perdue and loeffler, each among the senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of congress received information about the public health and economic threats of covid-19 as trump and republicans downplayed the pandemic. none of the trades has been found to violate the law or senate ethics, but warnock and ossoff have cast the republicans as self-interested and out of touch.
perdue and loeffler have answered by lambasting the democrats as certain to to usher in a leftward lunge in national policy. neither warnock nor ossoff is a socialist, as republicans allege. they do, however, support biden's agenda.
this week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. the stakes have drawn nearly $500 million in campaign spending to a once solidly republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground.
it's really about whether an agenda that moves the nation forward can be forged without significant compromise, said martin luther king iii, the son of the civil rights icon. there are a lot of things that are in the balance.
the results also will help demonstrate whether the political coalition that fueled biden's victory was an anti-trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.
biden won georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in november.
democratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of african americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped biden become the first democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win georgia. republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro atlanta.

more than 3 million georgians voted before tuesday. some precincts in metro atlanta showed light-to-steady turnout tuesday morning with no lines and voters taking just a few minutes to complete their ballots.
in downtown atlanta, henry dave chambliss, 67, voted for the two republicans. he said he wants republicans to keep senate control to ensure the incoming biden administration doesn't slide all the way to the left.
i'm moderately successful and i know they will come after more of my money which i've earned, chambliss said. i was born a southern democrat, and i just hope and pray that some moderate voices are heard and things stay more in the middle of the road.
beverly mcdaniel cast her ballot tuesday morning amid light turnout at a neighborhood center's gymnasium in atlanta. she voted for both democrats, saying she believes they would do better dealing with the hardships wrought by the coronavirus.
our kids are not fully, fully in school like they're supposed to be and people don't have jobs, said mcdaniel, a medical field worker. she said the virus is taking over where we should have the government taking over instead.

update: prime minister justin trudeau and u.s. president donald trump announced on wednesday march 19, 2020 that the canada-u.s. border will be temporarily closed to help slow the spread of covid-19. more details here.
ottawa — the federal government is retooling messaging for travellers arriving in canada amid criticism that it's not doing enough to ensure thousands of people entering the country don't drive a national spike in covid-19 cases.
but even as border officials are updating signs and pamphlets in order to ensure everyone coming in goes into self-isolation, prime minister justin trudeau said sunday the question of whether to close the border overall remains up for discussion.
hundreds of canadians are on their way back to canada as the novel coronavirus continues its global march, its epicentre now in europe where borders are closing, flights are being cancelled and entire towns are being ordered into seclusion to control the spread of the illness.
the canadian press prime minister justin trudeau holds a news conference at rideau cottage in ottawa on friday.
on saturday, the federal government had urged travelling canadians to return home while they still had the chance, but the liberal government continues to face pressure to close canada off as well from the outside world.
trudeau said sunday that what decisions his cabinet will make will be guided by science.
and canada's top public health official said what the science shows at the moment is that closing borders didn't work for other countries, and what's more important is how the society works together.
that's why all travellers are being asked to self-isolate, as they can't be forced to do it, dr. theresa tam said at a news conference in ottawa.
it is impossible to be essentially keeping tabs on every single traveller that comes in, she said.
this is a social phenomenon, this is a societal response and everybody must take that responsibility. public health is going to do what it can.
on sunday, authorities were updating signage and information at airports in the wake of many travellers reporting that as they re-entered canada from abroad, they were being given no details about what to do — unless they were arriving from the three historic hotspots for the illness: china, iran and italy.
tam said the epicentre of the outbreak has now shifted to europe as a whole, and as the situation continues to change, so too will the information travellers receive.
while tam said all canadians need to be taking what measures they can to curb the spread of the illness, she did not suggest the border close.
we have to maintain essential movement of people and services as well, she said.
canada now has more than 320 cases of covid-19, with all 10 provinces reporting infections though most, so far, are directly linked to travel. there has been one death, and a number of the early cases are now considered recovered.
trudeau acknowledged sunday that things are changing fast, and nothing is off the table — including shutting the border and making isolation and screening at the border mandatory.
we are hearing the concerns people have had, he told ctv's question period in an interview outside his home, where he and his family remain in self-isolation following his wife's diagnosis with the illness.
the shift in posture from the united states of course gives us significant things to think about and we will be discussing it later today among other measures at our cabinet meeting.
this week, u.s. president donald trump closed his country to travel from europe.
the opposition conservatives have been calling for trudeau to shut down the borders, and reiterated that call sunday.
asking people to act isn't good enough, said the party's critics on health and public safety in a statement.
it's not enough for the government to simply announce a policy, they must ensure it is being enforced and that front-line staff have the necessary resources and supports, matt jeneroux and pierre paul-hus said.
trudeau's wife sophie was diagnosed with covid-19 following a trip to the united kingdom. he said she continues to recover and currently has a headache but it is not worse than a bad cold.
while other world leaders, including trump, have been tested as a result of being in close contact with those who have the virus, trudeau said the advice he has received is that the test would be wasted on him as he continues to show no symptoms.
this report by the canadian press was first published march 15, 2020.

a week after getting engaged, i woke up in the middle of the night soaked in my own stress sweat. the excitement of the proposal had worn off and the questions began to race through my mind.
how would our relationship change once we got married?
do we need to get married or can we just ditch the legal document?
will i have to drain my savings account to fund this wedding?
speaking of money, what will happen to my money once we're married?
that last question has stuck with me for quite some time. my fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. we've discussed topics like having kids, raising kids with a certain religion and our future career and relationship goals. we've always found ourselves seamlessly getting on the same page.
we've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.
for a while, i didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets. we just figured we'd keep our separate bank accounts, for a while, and figure out how to split bills and financially plan together, while keeping some things separate.
in new york, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. which means, it's shared. money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.
my fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word -- prenup.
but the more i thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more i began to panic. i knew i had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.
i thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong. essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? why not get that out of the way beforehand. the idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.
when i brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. he questioned why i had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. for starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.
i thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong.
it also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which i find normal. you're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? we decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.
before continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. we each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. we also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).
taking this step not only allowed us to both organize any outstanding financial mess (like the need to merge an old 401(k) into a sep ira) but also have all our assets documented in an easy to consume way.
after sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. a lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; i wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.
a lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this.
an entire coffee shop of people stared at me as i yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. i found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that i've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. though i've made money mistakes along the way, i was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.
we spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. i would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. we didn't reach a resolution.
we realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.
we sat down with someone at the financial gym, which according to their website is a group of financial trainers looking to put you in control of your finances, one step at a time.
we realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.
we met with a financial trainer who asked us questions about what our individual and joint financial goals were, analyzed our assets and helped us determine how much we should budget and save for our ideal retirement and investment plans.
turning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. while i always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out i was wrong.
before making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. this felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.
we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.
when we go to that appointment next month, we'll be ready to share our assets with the divorce lawyer, our future concerns and how we'd like to handle the worst case scenario of our relationship, an unexpected ending. either way, we're way past the awkwardness of having the prenup or financial protection conversation. now when the word comes up, we laugh and share with our friends proudly that we're considering getting one. a lot of them look at us with wide eyes of shock.
over dinner with another engaged couple, we talked about the p word and the only thing they could share with us was that they are concerned we're approaching our engagement journey in a negative way, by planning for the worst.
none of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.
society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life -- the actual wedding day.
the more i talked to friends about this and told them i might want to get one, the more i felt judged. some friends even texted me asking if i was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. i'm not. i truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean i should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how i will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. the wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.
i've spent years making money and saving it. when life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), i feel like i have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. it might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but i think it's the opposite. we've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.

diocese de beauvais noyon et senlis / youtube bernadette moriau's healing was recognized as a miracle by a roman catholic bishop on feb. 11.
nearly 10 years ago, a french nun named bernadette moriau visited the catholic shrine in lourdes in a wheelchair. after she returned to her convent near beauvais, she said, she was miraculously healed and able to walk for the first time in decades.
the roman catholic church in lourdes investigated her claim, and on sunday a french bishop placed a stamp of approval on it, formally declaring moriau's recovery to be a miracle.
bishop jacques benoit-gonin of beauvais announced the 79-year-old nun's story of healing to be the 70th recognized miracle associated with lourdes, a popular pilgrimage site. he called her recovery a sudden, instantaneous, complete and durable change, according to the associated press.
regis duvignau / reuters lit candles are seen near the entrance to the grotto of massabielle in lourdes, france, on nov. 4, 2016.
the sanctuary of lourdes in southern france marks the spot where in 1858, a 14-year-old girl named bernadette soubirous claims to have seen apparitions of the virgin mary. millions visit the site every year, believing that water from a spring in the sanctuary's grotto has healing powers.
moriau visited lourdes on a pilgrimage in 2008. according to la stampa, the nun had cauda equina syndrome, a rare condition that affects the spinal nerve roots and can lead to paralysis of the legs. she'd had four operations on her spinal column and had been unable to walk since 1987.
moriau said that when she visited the grotto, she never asked for a miracle, per ap. she just asked for the conversion of my heart and the strength to continue my path as a sick person, la stampa reports.
she returned to her home convent and visited the chapel to pray.
i felt a [surge of] well-being throughout my body, a relaxation, warmth. ... i returned to my room and, there, a voice told me to 'take off your braces,' moriau said in a diocesan video about the event. surprise. i could move.
below, bernadette moriau discusses her experiences in french.
the nun's claims were evaluated by the international medical committee of lourdes, a team of medical professionals brought together by the bishop of tarbes and lourdes in order to assess whether stories of healing that emerge from lourdes can be explained on the basis of current medical knowledge.
the committee reportedly found that moriau's case could not be explained scientifically. the bishop of beauvais, who has the last word on cases involving people living in his diocese, agreed that her healing appeared to be miraculous.
she immediately started to walk without any help, in a totally autonomous way, benoit-gonin said.
the last officially recognized miracle at lourdes was announced in 2013. in that case, an italian woman who had visited the shrine in 1989 said she was miraculously healed of severe high blood pressure and other problems.
the catholic church requires extensive documentation to verify the claim of a miracle. the process, which can take years, includes fact-finding, psychological examinations and theological evaluations.
miracles are tied to canonization in the catholic church. before being declared a saint, the deceased candidate will usually have been credited with performing at least two verified miracles.

the world looked on in horror as a mob stormed the u.s. capitol building on wednesday, putting a country that touts itself as the planet's oldest, strongest and most exceptional democracy on the brink of succumbing to the authoritarian whims of president donald trump and his most radical supporters.
but in brazil, perhaps more than anywhere else, the capitol riots felt like a warning from a not-so-distant future.
since winning election in 2018, far-right brazil president jair bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that trump and the republican party fomented over the last six months.
that trump's provocations resulted in wednesday's melee in washington set off alarm bells in bolsonaro's brazil, as if it were merely the matinee.
attack on democracy, the front page of estado de s. paulo, one of brazil's largest newspapers, blared in bold, capitalized letters on thursday morning ― coverage of news from afar that nevertheless felt like a plea for brazilians to heed the danger facing their own republic.
for brazil, it is a warning about what can happen even worse here, if bolsonaro's authoritarianism and his militias are not contained, if violations of freedom and rights continue to be tolerated, former leftist president lula da silva, who sought to challenge bolsonaro in 2018's elections before he was barred from running, wrote on twitter.
(photo by lev radin/pacific press/lightrocket via getty images) pro-trump rioters stormed the u.s. capitol on wednesday, breaking through security barriers and entering the building in a desperate and conspiracy theory-fueled effort to stop the electoral college certification process from proceeding.
alessandro molon, an opposition member in brazil's lower house of congress, tweeted that the riots in the united states proved that not even the most stable democracy in the world survives right-wing populism with impunity!
that is why it is so important to come together: we need to protect ourselves and avoid the worst in 2022! molon pleaded, while são paulo state gov. joão doria, a former bolsonaro ally who may run against him in next year's elections, called it an alert for brazil, where a minority that flirts with authoritarianism and fanaticism tries to weaken institutions and threaten the rule of law.
for more than two months, as trump has parroted absurd claims of voter fraud and stolen or disappeared votes, bolsonaro remained one of his only international allies in the fight. he was one of the last world leaders to recognize president-elect joe biden's november victory, and still seems hellbent on pretending that trump isn't going anywhere yet.
this is not a new cause célèbre for the brazilian. bolsonaro, like trump, peddled conspiracies about the 2018 election, openly musing about malfeasance against him even in a race he won. he has not stopped since: although many of bolsonaro's other blatant threats to democratic institutions, as well as the destruction of the amazon rainforest on his watch, have received more international attention, he has spent the last two years attempting to undermine brazil's electoral system and the last two months using trump and the united states as a reason to ramp up his attacks.
ap photo/alex brandon trump and bolsonaro have fashioned themselves into international allies on every major topic of their presidencies, and have mimicked each other's often-conspiratorial approaches to climate change, covid-19, democracy and elections.
just as many brazilians have pointed to trump as an example of the horrors that bolsonaro could bring to their own nation, bolsonaro has warned that the problems that exist in the minds of trump and some republicans in america will make their way to brazil soon.
on thursday, he pushed brazil to abandon electronic voting machines that provide fast and reputable vote counts in favor of paper ballots ― a move some have warned could fuel the type of conspiracy theories that, in the u.s., baselessly alleged that mail-in voting was linked to rampant fraud.
there were people there who voted three, four times, dead people who voted, bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on thursday morning, according to folha de s.paulo, brazil's largest newspaper. and here in brazil, if we have the electronic vote in '22, it will be the same thing. … we're going to have a worse problem than the united states.
no such thing actually occurred in the u.s., and no such thing is likely in brazil, where the voting system is far more efficient and immediately accurate than any in the united states. but that doesn't matter to bolsonaro. the point is to find even the smallest kernel of evidence to bolster wild-eyed conspiracy theories.
such remarks would be dangerously anti-democratic in normal times, but any sense of normalcy ceased to exist both in the u.s. and in brazil years ago. in 2016, dozens of angry, right-wing brazilians evaded security and invaded the country's national congress building to call for a military takeover of the government, a small demonstration that nevertheless offered some indication of the discontent that would later drive bolsonaro to power and portended worse to come. more recently, bolsonaro has fueled similar outbursts that feel like direct precursors to the sort of insurrection that occurred in washington.
throughout the first two years of his presidency, bolsonaro's most radical supporters have called for the closure of the national congress and the supreme court, and last year, a handful of militants were arrested after shooting fireworks at the supreme court building, as if to mimic a bombing. bolsonaro doesn't always endorse the worst, but he's always there to stoke the fervor among them.
luis macedo/afp via getty images in november 2016, dozens of protesters invaded the brazilian congress to call for a military takeover of the government. it was peaceful compared to the riots that took place this week in the united states but foreshadowed further calls for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court from right-wing brazilians.
trump's instinct is also to throw red meat to his base when times are tough. and the riots, which broke out immediately after trump explicitly told his supporters to go to the capitol, offered brazilians an obvious look at how easily such agitation can erupt into a full-blown explosion, said bruno boghossian, a political columnist for folha de s.paulo.
if we only look at it from the perspective of political agitation, it seems like [bolsonaro] is only trying to get more support and make these people angry so they can support him with even more passion, boghossian said. but when trump really does something about it, when he does something concrete, then we see what bolsonaro can really do.
from the beginning, the worry in brazil was that bolsonaro was a more dangerous version of trump, a force that would offer a much tougher stress test for younger, less entrenched institutions. trump and the republican party ultimately proved american institutions weaker than many initially presumed, but in the end, the country's elections, the judiciary that oversees them and the congress required to certify them appear to have held ― if only just, and if only (possibly) just for now.
brazil's institutions, meanwhile, have at times acquitted themselves better than many thought they would, and divides in brazil's congress, where bolsonaro doesn't enjoy the support of a consolidated party like trump does in the gop, may help shield the country from total disaster.
(ap photo/andre borges) in may 2020, bolsonaro greeted supporters who had gathered in brasilia, the brazilian capital, to call for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court.
but it's also not clear, boghossian said, that other institutions, including lower ranks of the military and the judiciary, would stand firm in the face of an all-out challenge should bolsonaro manage to incite one.
in the united states there was objection from the military, from congressmen from the republican party, from electoral authorities from the republican party in the states, and from the vice president, boghossian said. i'm not sure that bolsonaro is going to have the objection of all these players in brazil. … the checks and balances and the democratic institutions and all the authorities involved in the political process might not be as hard on bolsonaro as the american authorities were on trump.
there are nuanced differences between brazil and the united states that the ready-made comparisons between trump and bolsonaro often obscure. still, it's undeniable that trump's election in 2016 was a preview of what followed in brazil two years later. brazil didn't learn the lessons on offer from its northern neighbor then. but this time, it still has a chance to heed the warnings before it's too late.
brazil must learn a lot from yesterday's terrible events in washington, miriam leitão, a columnist for rio de janeiro's o globo newspaper, wrote on thursday. this is exactly president bolsonaro's plan, and that is why he has been nurturing conspiracy theories around the electronic ballot box, the country's electoral laws, and the [supreme court] since 2018. he plans to reap what we saw yesterday in washington.
brazil should take everything that happened yesterday seriously, leitão continued. a president who lies for years and sabotages the bases of the republic will one day use his powers against the country. we need to strengthen the defenses of brazilian democracy.

ahmed elhubbish, a middle-aged yemeni living in yemen's capital city of sanaa, wants to know what his children — abdul rahman, khalid, wasim and siham — did wrong.
last year, they were killed in an airstrike launched from thousands of miles above them by sophisticated machinery from continents away. what could make them targets for the coalition led by saudi arabia and supported by the u.s. that has been bombing yemen since 2015?
there's not a single reason for persistent attacks on yemenis such as the may 2019 strike that hit his children, elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from hunger ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in yemen, which was directed by oscar and emmy nominee skye fitzgerald. (watch above. note: the video contains graphic images.)
the footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with huffpost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.
lawmakers, u.s. officials, humanitarian groups, anti-war activists, arms dealers, foreign representatives and others have debated the american role in yemen for years in washington ― though rarely with such vivid evidence of the policy's consequences as is documented in fitzgerald's film.
it's vital now to have a clear picture of what president-elect joe biden's choices could mean for yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change u.s. policy.
the country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when iran-backed rebels known as houthis ejected yemen's internationally recognized government from sanaa. six months later, saudi arabia and its allies, notably the united arab emirates, launched a military intervention against the houthis ― with crucial backing from the u.s. and other western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.
most national security experts believe that without american support for the bombing, the saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. that move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own yemeni partners.
the war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the united nations reported in december. airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the yemen data project, an independent monitoring group. the strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting state department lawyers to worry that american involvement could implicate u.s. officials in war crimes.
after nearly five years of fighting, the houthis continue to control the most populated parts of yemen ― and the saudis continue to bomb those regions with u.s. support, most recently on new year's eve.
under president barack obama, washington provided the saudi-led coalition with aerial refueling that enabled it to run longer bombing campaigns, as well as intelligence and regular supplies of fresh bombs, while defending the campaign from international criticism and supporting a saudi blockade of yemeni ports that drove up food prices and pushed millions of yemenis into famine-like conditions.
president donald trump continued that policy and took further steps against the houthis that had devastating consequences for yemenis, such as slashing u.s. aid for houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. when lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher u.s. approach to the saudis over their role in the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi, trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of american aid to the saudi-led coalition.
trump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.
biden has promised he will end the obama-era policy and treat saudi arabia as a pariah. but he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that trump crafted for the u.a.e. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional democrats opposes.
the humanitarian situation in yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, scott paul of oxfam america told huffpost in december after a slim senate majority approved the u.a.e. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in yemen. congress and the biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in yemen.

Already this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced at least 50 major gun control bills, including measures to expand background checks and ban lethal accessories like bump stocks, according to a count by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control organization co-founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived a 2011 shooting.

We have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAP's authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank.
For businesses, the desire to rely on PRI to strip out non-commercial risk from transactions will become greater than ever, for the same reason - to grow and generate ever greater revenue, deals must be done, even when the ground shifts beneath them. There will be ever greater competition for the product, but only those transactions with the best story to tell, and having the right combination of quality, tenor, size, and location, will receive coverage. Revenue in coming years will become increasingly associated with thought leadership and bravado, combined with deployment of the right risk management tools.
Rollins told Fox News' Lou Dobbs on Friday: If you're going to put her out front with her mouth ... the little girl who wants pre-Reagan economics of 70 percent taxes, the Democratic women are basically going to be damaged.
Over the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier.
In November, Scotland voted to make period products free, becoming the first country to do so. Slow strides have been made stateside, too.

But then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. Warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. Buttigieg seemed to have it out for Sanders and Klobuchar. And Biden and Sanders took their turns punching at Bloomberg, like the rest of them.

At this point in his presidency, there's no way to look at it other than Donald Trump is using his position and taxpayer dollars to make money for his businesses, said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. This is beyond a conflict of interest. This is corruption, plain and simple.
And yet big corporations like Microsoft still want more. They are fighting for legislation in Congress that would exempt all of their offshore profits from any U.S. taxes. Known as a territorial tax system, this will create even more incentives to shift profits--and jobs -offshore. Instead, U.S. corporations should pay the same tax rate on profits no matter where they are earned.
After initially saying it would require everyone to file a tax return, the IRS said it would use Social Security data to deliver the payments to people receiving Social Security retirement or disability insurance. But people who don't receive those particular benefits still have to file.
Biden, according to The New York Times, plans to keep FBI Director Chris Wray unless he's fired by Trump before the president leaves office. Wray, a Republican who once said he'd quit before breaking the law for the president, has upset Trump with his descriptions of the loosely organized anti-fascist movement known as antifa, his description of the limited impact of voter fraud, his discussion of Russian election interference, and his refusal to provide Trump's campaign with a last-minute boost by violating DOJ standards and publicly announcing some sort of politically advantageous investigation. Wray has defended the bureau from Trump's attacks, but he's been quiet post-election as Trump has made broad, sweeping claims about mass voter fraud, which law enforcement officials say could inspire attacks by right-wing extremists convinced that the election was illegitimate.
The vast majority of town halls will put up council tax and hike charges as 80% fear for their financial survival, according to a new survey. An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.
Cutting taxes, though, is a perennial priority for Republicans and almost certainly would have passed a GOP-controlled Congress with or without Trump's backing. Legislation pushing Trump's own agenda, on the other hand, was almost nonexistent.
Unfortunately, inadequate access to period products is rarely discussed even in the best of times.
Well-funded emergency savings: Before you start investing too heavily, it's important to have an emergency fund to fall back on. After all, you should never invest money you might need to pay bills or cover an unexpected expense. Having those emergency savings set aside can help you avoid falling into debt if the rest of your cash is tied up in the market.
That's about the amount of tax revenue Microsoft is not paying because it has stashed $108 billion in profits offshore. As revealed in a Seattle Times report last month, Microsoft uses a web of overseas subsidiaries to dodge U.S. taxes, knocking its tax rate down to a minuscule 4.5 per cent on its offshore profits. That's lower than most working families pay.
Before you switch, Ortega recommends looking at your bills holistically, consolidating accounts so you can see a full picture of where your money is going and coming from, and saving enough to cover fixed costs such as rent, mortgage, or car payments for three to six months. If you're taking money out of a 401(k), consider timing that action to when you are making less money and in a lower tax bracket, she said.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government now spends tens of billions of dollars each year providing financial assistance to people who buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the exchanges (like Covered California) that some states run on their own. The financial assistance takes two forms ― tax credits that discount premiums, and direct subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs.
Ending SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the program's beneficiaries ― most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled ― it would also rattle the economy.
Precisely how many taxpayer dollars wind up in Trump's pocket from these stays cannot be determined. The White House, despite numerous queries from HuffPost over a period of months, refuses to disclose how many executive branch employees stay with Trump when he visits his own properties and how much it is costing taxpayers. And how much of that revenue winds up as profit flowing to Trump also is not known because Trump reneged on a campaign promise ― and decades of precedent ― by refusing to disclose his tax returns.
Before period poverty can be addressed in a significant way, people need to be made aware it's even a problem, said Eiko La Boria, the founder of The Flow Initiative, a non-profit that addresses period poverty and gender equity in Jersey City.

This could be something really random, she said. You want income coming in, especially if you're leaving a job that you've been with for 10 years and you're used to having that every-two-weeks-a check-is-coming-in [situation]. It's a very hard transition for a lot of people, she said.

Trump promised when he was campaigning in 2016 not to cut Medicare and Social Security. But he also indicated in a CNBC interview in January that he was ready to shave benefits. He also said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that he would do so at some point.
She even took a jab — albeit a smaller one — at Sanders, whom she has often buddied up with on the debate stage.
Gun rights advocates have improved chances in some states this year. The NRA helped defeat moderate Democrats in the U.S. Senate, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. The Parkland students also faced a disappointing loss in their home state with the victory of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

So I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians' — and, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, Warren said in her first remark of the night.

One of the messages Wren retweeted was from Stop the Steal, another group identified as a rally participant on a website promoting the event. The Jan. 2 message thanked Republican senators who said they would vote to overturn Biden's election victory, including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas. She also retweeted a Jan. 1 message from the president promoting the event, as well as promotional messages from one of the president's son, Eric Trump, and Katrina Pierson, a Tea Party activist and a spokesperson for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

I have not been able to move beyond the belief that Jesus was one of the great teachers of mankind.

Biden took office at noon last Wednesday and did not arrive at the White House until nearly 4 p.m. Yet within two hours, he had signed 17 executive actions, including orders reentering the United States into the Paris agreement to combat climate change, ending the national emergency that Trump had declared to let him raid money for his border wall from the military construction budget, suspending Trump's ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, revoking Trump's order blocking the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census, and reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that halts deportation of many immigrants who came into the country illegally as young children.
If the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship, Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post, adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.

Sanders adviser David Sirota has also referenced the speech in the Jan. 7 edition of his email newsletter, Bern Notice, claiming that Biden had lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
As part of the action, the governor also pardoned 9,219 low-level cannabis conviction records, part of the state's efforts to repair the damage inflicted by the war on drugs ― primarily on residents of color.
Implication: a mad rush by consumers and businesses to establish direct import relationships with foreign suppliers. But this a) evades the tax and spoils the incentive, and b) has no rational economic purpose, so it undermines economic efficiency.
Social media is all about building relationships over time, and you can't build a relationship with someone if all you are doing is thinking of yourself and your bottom line.
Coincidentally, a Democrat is about to occupy the White House.
Your workout routine could be sabotaging you. Here are the moves you should do before sleep and the ones to skip.
Biden inaccurately claimed on Saturday that a video circulated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had been doctored to make him seem more supportive of Social Security cuts than he really is.
I haven't seen ya'll since the campout. I've got something to say, right? I'm tired of this fucking shit. I'm a father, I'm a veteran, and I'm an anarchist. Those are three people you don't want to piss off, all right? I'm tired of children getting attacked in the streets. I'm tired of them sleeping in the fucking streets. I'm tired of seeing the very people that I swore to defend get attacked by the state.
In one version of these scams, you might be asked to pay an application fee in order to apply for a job. The truth is that no federal agency, including the Census Bureau, charges an application fee, Weisman said.
We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love, Sanders said. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.
But Democrats aren't the only ones who are calling for conditions to bailouts for major industries that are severely affected by the economic crisis. Keith Anderson, co-founder of investment firm BlackRock, suggested in a letter to The New York Times this week that stock warrants should be attached to any loans given by the federal government, similar to what a private investor would require when bailing out a troubled company.
After being arrested and jailed for sedition in 1922, Gandhi retreated from political prominence for a few years. The letter to Frantz was written during this time.
The rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable Americans. According to one estimate, the cost of COVID-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.
Its depiction of Wall Street as infested with greed, devoid of ethics and indifferent to the real-life consequences of its conduct on Main Street Americans was spot on.
The Census Bureau will be contacting Americans in a variety of ways, including phone calls, letters and even Census Bureau workers who will come to your home, said Steven Weisman, a lawyer, professor, author and expert in identity theft and cybersecurity. And as a part of the census, you will be asked for certain types of personal information.
The issue of corporate accountability remains fresh in many lawmakers' minds. In 2009, amid the Great Recession, the insurance company American International Group (AIG) handed out millions in bonuses after receiving a bailout from the federal government. The move prompted widespread criticism from both parties on Capitol Hill and further soured the public on the idea of taxpayer-funded bailouts, especially to Wall Street.

On Tuesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) warned low interest rates could rise, that the federal budget deficit is frightening and that Yellen should be a voice of fiscal sanity within the administration.
The conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed, Super said in an email. But, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute.
That analysis, though, ignores the single biggest driver of presidential costs: the use of Air Force One.
I have to factor this cost into my already tight budget and I find myself filled with dread when my period comes around and I have to fork up that fee, she told HuffPost.

In his much-celebrated memoir A Promised Land, former President Barack Obama described his 2009 stimulus bill in sweeping terms. By any conventional yardstick, I was about to sign historic legislation: a recovery effort comparable in size to FDR's New Deal, Obama wrote.
President Barack Obama recently weighed in on the issue, saying that while he didn't know exactly why tampons were so often taxed as luxury items, he had a hunch.
New York hadn't passed a comprehensive gun control package since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in neighboring Connecticut. The legislature in 2013 passed a law that limited high-capacity magazines, implemented universal background checks and revoked the gun licenses and weapons of the severely mentally ill.
No offense to the NFL players, but — c'mon, dudes — the commercials were always going to be the Super Bowl MVP.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added on Twitter: There is no straight-face justification to give no-strings-attached cash to an industry that had the chance to use massive profits and tax cuts to build a rainy day fund, but instead used the money to pad investor returns and executive pay.
In a statement issued the same day rioters attacked the Capitol, Amy Kremer denounced the assault and said it was instigated after the rally by a handful of bad actors, while seeming to blame Democrats and news organizations for the riot.
GOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals.
Yet when asked what steps the federal government could take to break the impasse, Carr merely said all options are on the table.

There were six presidential candidates on the debate stage in Nevada: former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Each one still sees a path to the White House, but the clock is ticking.

Pricing is one of the fundamental building blocks of marketing. Many believe price is easy to understand when, in fact, it is one of the most difficult. McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the commodity mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies -- What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).
What's more, Biden's uses the term adjustments in reference to Social Security after going on a riff about whether affluent Americans actually need their benefits, making it sound as if he implicitly is interested in some form of means-testing or income-based benefit reductions.
Put he backpedaled with a tweet Friday, vowing to protect your Social Security and Medicare. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed he was talking about cutting the federal debt he has blown up through massive tax cuts, and not social programs.

Most of the Republican schemes under consideration, including a working draft of House legislation that Politico obtained last week, envision the federal government continuing to provide assistance to people who buy coverage on their own. But the assistance would take a different form ― with a new formula for the tax credits, and no special assistance for out-of-pocket costs.
Our mission is about setting businesses to succeed by being able to reach the customers they need to reach, Johnson said, explaining the thought process behind creating restaurant week.

That only opened him up to further attack.
She has repeatedly declined to repeat her recession-era critiques of the Obama administration and has largely refrained from relitigating the fight that brought her into politics: her battles with Biden over his push for bankruptcy legislation she said would sell out consumers. In general, with the exception of her now-famous wine cave attack on Buttigieg, Warren has avoided going on the attack against the other candidates.
States could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. That would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.
During the final week of the shutdown, sickouts spiked among federal employees who refused to show up for work, leaving staffing shortages, triggering airport delays and raising concerns over whether tax refunds would be processed on time.

It's possibly the most exhausted easy money-saving tip of all time: Cut back on those coffeeshop lattes, and you'll save enough to buy a home! Sounds straightforward enough, but also too good to be true. Besides, are we really spending that much on coffee? According to a new study, we apparently are. SurveyMonkey says that 44 percent of millennial women put less money into their retirement accounts this year than into their coffee funds. (Um, guilty.)
And even as the Trump administration continues to support its Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the Medicaid program amid the outbreak. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax Medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.
It's unclear, however, what Trump meant. Previous presidents visited the same western states numerous times, for example, and never once stayed in a Trump property.
Republicans sometimes dislike federal spending for other reasons that are less theoretical than the debt burden. Business owners complain that federal unemployment benefits put upward pressure on wages, and a booming economy will make it harder for Republicans to retake the White House in 2024.

While I hope that the citizens of our country who are most in need and the small businesses that have no access to capital markets are in the front of the line for assistance, when it does come time to lend a hand to these public companies, any loan or bailout should also provide a reward to the citizens of our country who are lending them money, he added.

Sanders faced some difficult subjects. He was met with familiar attacks on his health care plan and his self-proclaimed democratic socialism. And he was asked yet again to answer for angry online supporters.
As Biden notes in his conversation with the voter on Saturday, his Social Security plan would increase benefits and extend the program's solvency by lifting the cap on taxable income for Social Security purposes. The benefit increases he proposes include the creation of a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level, tackling poverty in late old age through a benefit bump-up for people collecting benefits for 20 years or more, and a change allowing surviving spouses to keep a larger share of benefits.

History shows that timing the market is extremely difficult to do, said Brittney Castro, in-house certified financial planner for the personal finance company Mint. It's a high risk for potential high return, but you can think of it like gambling in the sense that most of the time, you'll probably lose.
But if Nadella really wanted to show his support, he'd stop his company's tax dodging. And Congressional leaders would make true corporate tax reform a priority, forcing big corporations to finally start paying their fair share.

Though participating in the census is important and technically mandatory, you can't be fined or jailed for not completing your census survey.

As for my retirement-savings percentage, I have been telling myself that I need to up it to 7% (I'd love to get to 10%) but I have yet to actually do it.
Biden, for his part, acknowledged that executive orders and memorandums can only get him so far.
Trump will be flying Tuesday to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S-Mexican border. The city is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.
Aides have been urging the president to instead use the days he has left in office to highlight what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has repeatedly resisted their efforts as he has remained ensconced in the White House, behind closed doors, consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies.
State Sen. Sara Kyle (D), one of the sponsors of SB 2285, said the state should not tax a woman for having a menstrual cycle, according to The Tennessean. She ultimately would like to see the tax eliminated altogether.

In short, unlike other donors, the Mercers are not merely angling to influence the Republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets.

Now, state lawmakers are introducing gun control legislation even in states that have not taken up such measures in the past, Bocour said: 2019 is looking like it will be as successful, if not more successful than 2018.
Basically, Democrats believe there should be a right to decent, affordable insurance. They wrote the Affordable Care Act with that principle in mind. Democrats didn't achieve their goal ― millions of Americans remain uninsured, while millions more with coverage still face high costs. But something like 20 million people now have comprehensive policies they didn't have before. Overall, financial security and access to health care have improved.
Trump's failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden's signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump's legacy in a matter of days.
That's right, we have, Buttigieg jumped back. Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves to the backyards and diners.
Even more encouraging, the financial benefits of enrolling international students extend beyond the campus itself. A research study just released by the Brookings Institution analyzed 16 regions and concluded that in areas that would otherwise likely face economic hardship as a result of industrial job loss, colleges and universities act as an antidote, anchoring tax revenue, a wide variety of jobs, and often supporting industries that benefit from an educated and young workforce.
It's easy to get swept up in the GameStop success stories. One Redditor claimed to use his stock market profits to pay off his student loans. Another paid for his dog's lifesaving surgery. But that doesn't mean anyone with a Reddit account and some cash to burn should get into the same kind of day trading activity.
As a result of profit declines three quarters in a row, Bloomberg claims that the US is slipping into a profit recession. Some believe this is a result of a slump in crude oil prices and a sharp rise of the dollar. Of course, it is easy to point to those or even a slowdown of the Chinese economy. Instead of looking at the glass is half empty, some argue that these might be good things. There are definitely trade-offs. To increase profits, too many businesses focus on cutting expenses. That's the easier thing to do, and is one way to greater profits if there is not a corresponding decline in quality. Unfortunately, too many expense cuts come with quality declines -- especially when inferior materials are substituted or labor cuts cause drops in customer service.
The vast majority of states require people to pay sales tax on feminine hygiene products -- even though they often allow exemptions for necessities -- and there is a movement nationwide to change some of the laws.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, said: Councils are on the edge. They are for the most part holding services together (though a significant minority are not). But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector.
Like we saw last week with GameStop and AMC, at any given point, there are a number of factors that can come in and completely change the direction of any given stock or market index that may be completely irrelevant to the fundamentals of investing, such as investing in companies with strong balance sheets, Castro said. Those types of curveballs make successfully timing the market on a consistent basis nearly impossible.

We need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of un-protective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country, he added.
A day earlier, Castro ― the only defeated rival of Warren's to directly endorse her so far ― was in downtown Nashua for a meet-and-greet at Warren's office here.
The solution to our complex business tax code is to follow Milton Friedman's lead and eliminate all tax subsidies and lower rates so the free market can work without the government picking winners and losers. That's a true conservative's position. Speaker Ryan's proposals, on the other hand, pick the rich as winners and the rest of us as losers. That's a plutocrat's proposal and should be identified as such. We need to remember that the real function of the government is to protect the public from those who would abuse the system to enhance their power.
According to a report by the Government Accountability Office last year, the Air Force unit that operates the modified Boeing 747 normally used as the presidential aircraft spent $4.4 million for four round trips from Andrews to Palm Beach in early 2017 ― which works out to $273,063 for each hour of flight time.
The legislature in January passed six measures that ban bump stocks, extend waiting periods for gun purchases, prevent teachers from carrying guns in schools and allow law enforcement to remove guns from people judged to pose a danger to themselves or others.

We're in the top three in Iowa, and now we've landed in New Hampshire, and now we're out there fighting for everyone in New Hampshire, and then after that we have 55 more states and territories, Warren said during a short meeting with reporters Tuesday, indicating that there's little chance she would alter her campaign's long-game-focused, organizing-heavy strategy.
Seeing how feisty the rest of the field was, it's clear that some of the other candidates got that message, too: If things continue as they are, the race could consolidate around Sanders in a couple of weeks.
One trick for collecting personal information through the mail is sending postcards with a QR code and asking recipients to scan the code with their smartphones in order to access the census survey on a webpage, according to Rachel Willson, investigative coordinator in client relations for The Smith Investigation Agency.

Ontario is reviewing its Condominium Act and should insist that condo boards have tools to deal with this problem. A board should be forced to have a policy on short-term rents, stipulate conditions, and levy higher fees, but only if 80% of owners approve. Conversely, they should be allowed to ban Airbnb and their competitors and enforce that.

While states that participate may request additional federal Medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. Under traditional Medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.
So crazy, in fact, that despite not being an ultra-partisan fanatic, I am forced to the conclusion that either the GOP leadership is even stupider than ordinary political cynicism would assume, or the plan is simply not meant in earnest. (Is it a trap for Trump, to discredit him if he's foolish enough to buy into it? Dunno. A trap for the idea of tax-based trade reform? Ditto. But either of these hypotheses would make more sense than the idea that they actually mean it.)
In a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times, state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford (D) said the expungements are encouraging, yet ultimately incremental.
Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, decided to take into account how changes to financial assistance would interact with other changes that Republicans propose, like allowing insurers new flexibility over what to cover and how much they could charge. If such a plan became law, Blumberg concluded, it would be impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage, given their limited financial resources and potential medical needs.
As even casual visitors to Washington D.C. can attest, there are no multi-thousand acre tracts of active farmland or forests in the Nation's Capital. These features perform an invaluable environmental function in that they absorb rainwater and prevent it from gushing into - and polluting - lakes and streams. And so, rainwater, especially its virulent form, called stormwater, is a major nightmare for the District. So much so that the District, specifically its water/wastewater utility, called DC Water, has been working through a 25+ year solutioning process with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over what to do with the billions of gallons of stormwater that the District must deal with whenever there is a major rainstorm.

Ocasio-Cortez and other proponents of the Green New Deal have argued that the program would help alleviate inequality through public spending on sustainable energy sources aimed at curbing the devastating effects of climate change on low-income communities. Precisely how much the plan would cost, however, has not yet been hashed out.
Little of this description is accurate. Obama's $800 billion bill was equivalent to about 5.5% of U.S. economic output in 2008; New Deal spending amounted to around 70% of the economy the year before Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. There is no doubt the Great Recession would have been worse without Obama's bill, but it was not transformational legislation.

Right now, short-term, I feel that we can afford what it takes to get the economy back on its feet, to get us through the pandemic, and to relieve the burdens that it is placing on households and small businesses, she said, adding that helping a weak economy can result in a lower debt burden long-term.
Don't have an adorable pet-related to your business, or have a business about a topic most people aren't too crazy about? Twitter user @going_concern is a great example of how you can make light of an otherwise boring subject matter while still keeping it relevant to what you do.
Anyone who knows my history knows my history of standing up for people who have been hurt by bad actors, he said.
Since Congress passed a law calling for cash payments to most households in the U.S., people with low incomes haven't had a simple way to deal with the requirement that they file a tax return to get the benefit.
View your résumé as an explanation of where you want to go in your career, not a summary of what you have previously done.
The blame for this development rests squarely on the shoulders of Justin Trudeau. He has failed to take a single concrete step to ensure this project is completed. All he has done is give us empty words with no action, Scheer said.
As a former secretary of labor, I urge federal workers who continue to toil without pay to stop working and those who are furloughed to picket their workplaces. Trump's callous disregard for all of you and for the public welfare must end. He must reopen the U.S. government. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 22, 2019
It takes a while to gain that traction, you almost have to prove yourself against all the noise of everyone else.
He denied that the distribution was targeted at Palm Beach Country Club members. Shea did not respond to reports that the Macks were among those getting vaccinated. The brothers are both about 80 years old.

Freidman has been Cohen's partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said.
Ever wonder what Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher do at home? Well, it seems they run around the house eating each other's Cheetos and wiping their hands on the furniture. (Celebs really are just like us!)
Yes! she replied in English. (In a follow-up interview, Quito, who immigrated from Ecuador more than 30 years ago, confirmed that she is already an enthusiastic backer of his bid.)
Five of those requests involved potential school shootings, he said. Maryland judges approved around half of the requested seizures after evidentiary hearings, Popkin said.
Since Maryland's red-flag law took effect Oct. 1, state law enforcement has received at least 360 requests to remove firearms from residents considered to pose a risk, said Montgomery County Sheriff Darren Popkin, who led state sheriffs in implementing the law through new trainings and rewriting of forms.
There is a way to win as an investor. It starts with the realization that doing business with market-beating stockbrokers and advisors is designed to enhance their retirement at your expense.
Go where you are wanted, and make it about your customers instead of you.
It comes as a surprise to no one that Democrat-controlled statehouses are less advantageous to the firearms industry, he said. We'll see more restrictive gun laws, but we might see improvement to right-to-carry laws in other states in the country.
The Trump administration's new Medicaid funding plan is based on the same principles as those previous versions.
John Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) try to get in their time at the Democratic presidential primary debate Wednesday in Las Vegas.
HuffPost Canada reached out to Trudeau's office to respond to Scheer's claim.
We can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone, Buttigieg said. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.
Then there are the rights of other owners or neighbors in multiple unit dwellings where short-term rentals occur. Condo boards that allow or don't deal with short-term stays endanger or inconvenience other residents due to noise, pet, smoking or other violations.
My guess is, they're not documented, so my next call is to ICE to have each one of [them] kicked out of my country. They have the balls to come here and live off of my money. I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be here. The least they could do, the least they could do is speak English.
The Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.
A voter asked Biden at a campaign event in Indianola, Iowa, on Saturday about claims she had heard in phone calls that Biden supports Social Security cuts.
Garland will take over a Justice Department that Trump sought to weaponize against his political opponents and use as his personal law firm. Trump has fired or pushed out a number of key department officials, most famously former FBI Director James Comey. Trump appointees have used the Justice Department's power in an overtly political fashion, even if they've resisted Trump's desire to wield the department's prosecutorial power as a blunt political weapon.
Most importantly, however, both companies as constituted represent public safety threats. Strangers in buildings are a hazard because of access to residents, children, corridors, stairwells, gyms, pools, playgrounds, garages, storage areas, and lounges.
Super points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them.

Ask someone who has no idea what you do to look at your résumé so they can help you see what isn't clear and what industry vernacular from your old career you may still be using, Fitzpatrick said.
Indeed, the trip will mark the first time Trump has been seen in public since the speech he delivered to his supporters Wednesday, egging them on to fight before the Capitol violence.
A brokered convention has previously been more of a plot device than an active political reality, but I think it's an extremely live possibility in 2020, said Jeff Hauser, a Democratic strategist who supports Warren. In the context of a president who scares a party so much, and with the memory of 2016 divisions so sharp, I think the candidate who is disliked by the fewest members of the party is going to make a compelling choice.
I worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and Wall Street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue. It's that the underlying premise is fatally flawed. Many investors believe their stockbrokers have a legal obligation to put the interest of the investor first. They don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. Stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.
The Internal Revenue Service unveiled a new website Friday where people who don't normally file tax returns can enter bank account information so they can receive coronavirus payments.
Warren's campaign is now airing an ad in both New Hampshire and South Carolina featuring her work during the recession, but it doesn't show her sharply questioning Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner or Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White, two Obama officials Warren regularly scorned. It shows President Barack Obama lavishing praise on her.
Many career Justice Department employees who held on for four years of the Trump administration were likely to depart had Trump been reelected and able to mold the department into an even more overtly political organization.
T-Mobile's (possibly banned) ad says a bad phone network is why Tom Brady came back to football. And ... that's a bad thing? Maybe the message is a bit confusing, but Brady and Gronk still have that great connection.

Under Tillerson, Exxon Mobil shifted away from its scorched-earth disinformation campaign denying the existence of global warming. During his confirmation hearings this month, Tillerson said he believes in climate change, though he rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from burning fossil fuels are the chief cause. Still, in 2009, he publicly backed putting a tax on carbon, albeit as his preference to the cap-and-trade system then being debated in Congress.
The stigma and shame that exists around menstruation have been generations in the making, but the pro-period movement has been gaining traction.
In the fall of 2014, Toby Neugebauer, a garrulous oil-and-gas billionaire from Texas, took Cruz and his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, to the Breitbart Embassy, the website's Washington headquarters near the Capitol. Bannon flitted in and out. Nix, as usual, did most of the talking. After Neugebauer and Roe visited SCL's London headquarters, the Cruz team agreed that CA could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. However, it was made clear to Rebekah and Nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by Chris Wilson, CEO of the research firm WPA. A source close to Cruz told me that Wilson's operation had played a crucial role when Cruz ran for the Senate with only 2 percent name recognition in Texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. Why, then, was CA necessary at all? No one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring CA was that the Mercers would support Cruz, says someone close to Roe. Nevertheless, after CA was engaged, Neugebauer took a private jet to the Bahamas to meet Robert Mercer on the Sea Owl. When Neugebauer asked him to donate to Cruz's bid, Robert was matter-of-fact. The family would start with $11 million.
The investors who manipulated the market and made money off a few stocks got lucky, to say the least. But plenty more missed the mark, including YouTuber David Dobrik, who lost $85,000 trying to ride the GameStop wave.
In Connecticut, the gun industry advocacy group National Shooting Sports Foundation's Mark Oliva, a public affairs manager, said he was encouraged by the court's decision to take up the case. It was its first major Second Amendment case since the court upheld the right to possess firearms, striking down a strict Washington, D.C., gun law in 2008, Oliva said.
While several states are moving forward with their bans, the Trump administration has made the possession of the devices illegal starting in late March.
Bernie has started very much — has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisers say, eh, probably won't happen anyway.
In November 2013, I found out that a handful of my New York condo neighbors were renting out their units through Airbnb. This was unacceptable and I wrote an article in a major New York newspaper that helped fan a movement.
President Obama may well outline plans to address some of those public challenges in his SOTU speech. The audience, including the Congressional leadership and Microsoft CEO Nadella, will doubtless applaud.

The Sanders campaign has circulated video of part of a speech Biden delivered to the Brookings Institution in April 2018 in which he discusses his views about Social Security and appears to credit then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for zeroing in on the program's financial problems. Below is a version of the clip that Sanders advisor Warren Gunnels shared.

President-elect Joe Biden has said he'd halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump's restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions.
The policy, which the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services calls Healthy Adult Opportunity, is the Trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held Republican goal: to shrink Medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state Medicaid programs.
In Canada, the conversation about this business model is just beginning. This week, the Institute for Hospital and Tourism Research at Ryerson U's Ted Rogers School of Management held a symposium about Airbnb.

The anonymous White House official's claim that more motorcades would have been required also does not tell the whole story. A full motorcade ― including the presidential limousine, staff vans and various specialized trucks ― is needed in any city where Trump is traveling, regardless of whether it will be used to move him from an airport to an event site and back, or to an overnight hotel and then to the event site the next day.
After Kinder Morgan announced its decision Sunday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr released a statement calling on the B.C. government to end all threats to delay the Trans Mountain expansion.
Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security. The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security ― he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Saturday evening. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.

But it's unclear how the Warren team plans to jumpstart her campaign into actually winning the nomination, particularly as Sanders continues to raise gargantuan sums ― his campaign announced Thursday morning he raised more than $25 million in January ― and seemingly consolidates his hold on the left-leaning voters they once battled over.

If you end up on a site like this, leave immediately.
In a statement, Cruz was diplomatic: We were delighted to work with Cambridge Analytica, they were a valuable asset to my campaign, and any rumors to the contrary are completely unfounded. (The source close to Rebekah added, I was with Rebekah the other day and Ted Cruz was falling all over her. It's not fair to blame CA's methodology for Cruz's loss.) Others from Cruz's team, however, remain bitter about the whole experience. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican Party, says one, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her. … She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells.
Indeed, the repeated overnight trips to Las Vegas may have forced the Secret Service and other support personnel to keep a motorcade there for a full four days, rather than move it to the site of an upcoming presidential trip.

The nominee will face the challenge of determining how the Justice Department will approach potential criminal investigations into Trump and members of his administration. They will also face the prospect of rebuilding components like the Civil Rights Division, which abandoned key issues like police reform and focused on controversial religious liberty cases and attacks on college affirmative action programs. They'll also have to deal with the long-term consequences of Trump's attacks on the FBI, which has gutted Republicans' confidence in the nation's premier law enforcement organization. Biden's nominee may also have to figure out how to combat a rise in right-wing domestic terrorism cases, some of which have been directly inspired by the outgoing president's rhetoric against his political enemies and Muslims.
George Shea, a spokesman for David Mack and his brother, Bill Mack, said in a statement Wednesday that the Macks were helping MorseLife in its efforts to distribute the vaccine and did nothing wrong.

The Liberal government approved the project, which would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C., in 2016. The prime minister has repeatedly said the pipeline will be built but has faced calls from Tory MPs to be more vocal in advocating for the project.
As the Urban Institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using Medicaid or the costs of COVID-19 treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.
How GOP Tax Credits Would Work
Attorney General William Barr, who replaced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions after he was forced out following the 2018 midterm elections, went to bat for Trump during Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, releasing a misleading summary of the Mueller report which controlled public opinion about the report's findings about Trump's actions for weeks. Barr, who holds strong views of executive power, was also accused of covering up Trump's actions in the Ukraine scandal that led to the president's impeachment by attempting to hide from Congress a whistleblower complaint about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president. Barr announced he would leave the Justice Department on Dec. 23.

Just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States became unmistakable, President Donald Trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.
Pressed on whether he was up for the task of taking on Trump, given his focus on love as a driving force in American politics, Booker expounded on the compassion of white lawyers who helped his parents overcome discrimination in the housing market and other civil rights advocates who helped move the country forward.
So, the question now arises: why would DC Water pay more for success? Well, let us say that the project exceeds its goals by 100%. That could mean that DC Water doesn't need to spend a possible $300 million on 300 acres of green infrastructure. They might be able to spend half of that to achieve their targets. That's could translate to enormous savings. So, why would DC Water pay its EIB investors an extra $3.3 million? The answer is simple: they are happy to pay out $3.3 million because they might save millions more!

That would be a massive change from how the program currently works, with federal and state governments together spending whatever it costs to treat beneficiaries. This setup allows Medicaid funding to expand during economic downturns and public health emergencies.
Moving our resources to greater markets is a greater priority, not just for Albertans, but for Canadians, and we are going to do that in a responsible way, he said.
Whatever you may think of the ethics of Wall Street, no one disputes its ability to understand how to get a return (for itself) on its investments. Politicians know what is expected of them. If they fail to deliver, they can expect their opponents to receive this funding in the next election.
As a result, pads, tampons, cups and other similar products are now eligible for inclusion in health savings and flexible spending account allowances. (HSAs and FSAs give employees the option to set aside pre-tax earnings to pay for qualified medical expenses ranging from doctor visits to co-pays to sunscreen.) Menstrual products had been ruled ineligible by the IRS because they did not alleviate or aid in the treatment plan of a specific illness.

In fact, Congress has already recognized these realities. The first coronavirus emergency bill that Trump signed includes additional Medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. That law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. Extra Medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.

In other words, DC Water and QV want to motivate investors to support investments that can develop environmentally positive results - motivating by paying for performance - encouraging environmentally minded investors to underwrite the likelihood of success for the project and get paid according to its riskiness - as one does with the rest of the investment market - thus mainstreaming environmentally beneficial projects into the investment community.

The national debt is the sum of the federal government's past budget deficits, which result from the government spending more money than it raises through taxes in a given year. Economists have said that too much government borrowing could hurt the economy at some point or limit the government's ability to respond to a crisis, but the ever-widening deficits of the Trump years, which have pushed the national debt to historic levels, do not appear to have caused any problems ― or that much concern among Republicans.

This week is not the first time Trump used presidential trips to spend time at his own properties, even though it added considerable travel and security costs for taxpayers. In 2018, for example, he spent two days between official meetings in London and a Helsinki summit with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at his own resort in Scotland, rather than waiting in London. And last summer, he insisted on staying at his resort on the west coast of Ireland on the days surrounding his visit to Normandy, France, even though it required several additional hours on Air Force One.

Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care, Warren said of his so-called Medicare for All Who Want It public option plan. It's not a plan; it's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-it note, insert plan here.
In late January, South Dakota became the latest state to allow its residents to carry handguns without a permit. Republican lawmakers in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia are considering similar measures.
For close watchers of the debate, Buttigieg is repeating an attack that Sanders, and Warren, have confronted before. As proposed, Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans to a single government-run health insurance program, is more generous than most private-sector plans. He has not identified a payment plan but instead cites a list of possible taxes he supports. And for unions with even stronger health care plans, Sanders has since said he would include a provision mandating companies with union-negotiated health plans to enter contract negotiations under the National Labor Relations Board.
Will Ferrell is not pleased Norway is outselling the USA when it comes to electric cars, and he really wants Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina to know about it. Ferrell's basically like, Get in the car, lugers. We're going shopping.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is finally firing back at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' depiction of him as a longtime proponent of Social Security cuts, following a Tuesday debate in Des Moines, Iowa, that omitted the issue entirely.
Works as: Stay-at-home mom Annual salary: $0, husband's salary is $30K Monthly Coffee Spend: $6.50 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $0 I buy one 30-oz Folger's coffee jug for $6.50 (I keep coupons) and that usually lasts me two months-ish. I used to drink SO MUCH more coffee but I'm breast-feeding so now I have one cup a day.
Biden's campaign maintains that the plan on his campaign website, which would increase benefits, is what he meant by adjustments. Biden would not so much as consider cutting Social Security benefits in any way, according to the campaign.
It showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, Caddell told me. A whole new paradigm developing. No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle. As the Mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires.
The Illinois State Rifle Association is preparing a lawsuit against the state over the new store regulation law. Richard Pearson, the group's executive director, said with Democrats in charge of the legislature and the governorship, it's difficult for gun rights groups to block regulation efforts.
It is code for doing less, said John Holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute. It would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. Holahan published a policy brief on Wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal Medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.

This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the PRI industry, as well as those traders, investors and lenders who will utilize PRI to reduce their cost of capital and expand their business operations around the world. For the PRI industry, the challenge will be how to delicately balance a desire to underwrite more transactions with the need to impose even tighter underwriting standards. The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was. When paradigms shift, meaningfully predicting the future will become an even greater challenge.
Wren did not return messages seeking comment, and locked her Twitter account after the AP reached out to her last Monday to ask her about her involvement in the Trump rally and the tweets she had removed. Several days later, she blocked the AP reporter.
The contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued Hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.
The mooted GOP tax plan has drawn some positive attention from trade reformers because it's the first tax plan in decades to make serious moves designed to reduce America's trade deficit.
One of the ways scammers trick you into thinking you're talking with an official representative of the U.S. Census Bureau is through call spoofing. This involves manipulating Caller ID so that your phone displays the call as coming from the census, when it's really a robocaller or other kind of scammer.
When India achieved independence in 1947, Gandhi strongly opposed the country's partition into India and Pakistan, and he urged Hindus and Muslims to live together peacefully. He was killed on Jan. 30, 1948, by a Hindu fanatic who was angry about Gandhi's efforts to negotiate with Muslims.
Pringles thinks flavor stacking is out of this world.
At the Nashua event, unifying the party seemed to be her major message. Aides handed out Unite the party signs to attendees, and Warren took time to note she had won support from elected officials and organizers who had previously backed candidates who have dropped out of the contest.
Three health care experts broke down the original Price bill, to see how it would affect total costs for enrollees ― in other words, not just premiums, but also out-of-pocket costs. They published their results in Vox last week: Although premiums would be lower under the Republican plan, this decrease would be offset by an increase in cost sharing. Once the differences in tax credits are accounted for, the Republican plan would increase total costs for every age group except for those under 25.
Last year showed that Democrats could run on gun control and win despite opposition from the National Rifle Association, said Nico Bocour, the state legislative director at the Giffords Law Center.

There are so many women that have never heard of terms like period poverty or menstrual equity, yet once they do, it's as though a veil is lifted and they become allies, spokespeople, advocates in the fight to end it, she said. When we discuss it, we open the door to eradicating the shame and stigma associated with periods and period poverty, which will lead to a more menstrual equitable society.
The AP's review found at least three of the Trump campaign aides named on the permit rushed to obscure their connections to the demonstration. They deactivated or locked down their social media profiles, removed tweets that referenced the rally and blocked a reporter who asked questions.
We are shy to talk about periods, but they are a fact of life for 1 in 2 people, and feminine hygiene products are required for human dignity, added state Rep. Sherry Jones (D), the other sponsor of the bill. We shouldn't tax a woman to have her dignity, especially considering the gender wage gap. With this bill, we at least recognize the necessity with a lower rate equal to the sales tax on food.
It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the census process so you understand how and when you'll be contacted. Knowing the means by which the Census Bureau does and does not collect information is ultimately the key to being able to spot ― and evade ― a potential census scam, Tomaschek said.
That's an alternative to the Affordable Care Act ― not a replacement.

When skeptics like my seatmate hear these facts, support for international study programs rises dramatically. At a time of great concern over the fiscal health of our colleges and universities, examples of win-win solutions are hard to come by. And this economic story goes hand-in-hand with the powerful societal benefits of international education programs. American students benefit from attending schools with a greater diversity of ideas and perspectives from their international peers, while international students return to their home countries with a world class education and a better understanding of America and our values.
But what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman. A similar tax rate was imposed in the U.S. for 35 years after World War II, which included some of the most successful periods of economic growth in history, Krugman wrote.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for January's benefits. It's not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed.
Who the fuck are y'all to justify letting people die in the streets with your policies and your laws and your legislation. How do you justify that, killing people? I swore to give my life to defend the people from all forms of oppression. Eventually, the shit's gonna stop. Because when it's our turn, we won't make excuses for the terror. Marx.
Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends.
The review found the crowd was overwhelmingly made up of longtime Trump supporters, including Republican Party officials, GOP political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, off-duty police, members of the military and adherents of the QAnon myth that the government is secretly controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophile cannibals.
In addition, Biden's nominee will have to deal with the delicate question of how to handle the ongoing tax investigation into the new president's son, Hunter Biden, which is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. The nominee will have to reassure the American public that there won't be political interference in the probe, perhaps by walling off the investigation. Republicans, the vast majority of whom were unconcerned with Trump's repeated attempts to improperly interfere in Justice Department matters, might even call for a special counsel to assure the probe's independence.
Many others ― San Francisco, Berlin, Barcelona, to name a few ― have followed New York by restricting or banning both Airbnb and often Uber too.
As more and more women lost their jobs, people who used to be donors began to request products themselves.
Magerman, Robert's former colleague at Renaissance, recalls him saying, in front of coworkers, words to the effect that your value as a human being is equivalent to what you are paid. ... He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014. [1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do.
The scourge of COVID-19 has only exacerbated the problem. Many public places that supply free tampons and pads in bathrooms― school campuses, rec centers, libraries ― are closed.
Charlie Riedel/The Associated Press States across the country are attempting to raise the minimum age to buy a handgun. Gun control advocates are looking to capitalize on the momentum after the Parkland school shooting last year.
Booker calmly fielded questions about how he would respond to hypothetical attacks from President Donald Trump about Booker's ties to Wall Street, the perception that he is too corporate and his support for public charter schools at a moment of resurgent teachers union militancy.
The most important thing in my view that we can do today to put us on a path of fiscal sustainability is to defeat the pandemic, to provide relief to American people, Yellen said. To avoid doing what we need to do now to address the pandemic and the economic damage that it is causing would likely leave us in a worse place fiscally with respect to our debt situation.
Since it is mandatory for all households to participate in the census and since the census collects very detailed and sensitive personal information, it makes for quite an attractive target for scammers to take advantage of, said Attila Tomaschek, a data privacy expert with ProPrivacy.com. The good news, he said, is that if you know what to look out for, you can significantly reduce your chances of becoming a victim and having your sensitive information or identity stolen.
Cigarettes have become increasingly more affordable, according to the report. A 50 percent tax increase on cigarettes could see 47 million fewer male smokers and 20 million fewer premature deaths over 50 years.

They put together a tax-exempt municipal bond that DC Water would issue. They called it an Environmental Impact Bond (EIB). And it is, indeed just that: an environmental impact bond! Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest.
If a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%.
Meanwhile, there were indications of growing support for coordinated absences even as thousands of staffers were being encouraged to work without pay.

Last week, within minutes of an AP reporter sending her a LinkedIn message asking about her involvement in and understanding of what happened on Jan. 6, Salem blocked the reporter and did not respond to questions.
Just this week, for example, several conservative Republicans in Congress said they would vote against any bill with refundable credits, because they would consider giving money to people with no income tax liability akin to creating a new entitlement. Of course, a bill with no refundable credits would, by definition, leave out a huge chunk of the population now getting coverage through Obamacare.
A week after the rally, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president ever to be impeached twice. But the political and legal fallout may stretch well beyond Trump, who will exit the White House on Wednesday before Democrat Joe Biden takes the oath of office. Trump had refused for nearly two months to accept his loss in the 2020 election to the former vice president.
Hardy said the situation is emblematic of how many wealthy people have gotten richer during the pandemic, while many poor and middle class Americans have lost jobs and sometimes even their homes. He said many of his constituents have contacted him to get access to the vaccine for themselves, a parent or grandparent, but there is nothing he can do.
Booker, like Harris, is a co-sponsor of Sanders' September 2017 legislation replacing all but supplemental private insurance with one public federal program.
Buttigieg seemed most eager to pick this fight with Sanders, especially in light of recent news about the Culinary Workers Union — a powerful organizing force in Nevada that said it received harassing messages from Sanders supporters after signaling to its members that Medicare for All would be bad for them.
Recent research supports this thesis. For example, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in university tuition revenues, which partially offset the loss in appropriations [from state funding cuts]. The report concludes that in the absence of the pool of foreign students, many universities would have faced larger cuts to expenditures and potentially greater increases in in-state tuition charges.
The Larry Summers Age is over; the Biden era begins.
You don't want the stress of money coming up as you transition. The transition is already hard enough, said Ramona Ortega, founder of the personal finance platform My Money My Future. When you're making a big career switch, you need to have a pot of money that is going to hold you over, whether you're just starting a new job [and] it's going to be another three to four weeks before you actually get paid, or you're looking for a job, which can take an indefinite amount of time, she said.
The typed document, which contains Gandhi's handwritten signature, sold to a buyer in the Northeast for $50,000 on Friday, according to Nathan Raab, president of the historical document dealer Raab Collection in Ardmore, Pa. The company told HuffPost it does not disclose the identity of its buyers or sellers.
Democrats will, of course, still listen to Obama; he will remain a revered figure within the party, whatever intellectual paradigm we are now living in. But Summers is going out with the tide. By declining to hire Summers and nominating Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary, Biden demonstrated that he does not share Obama's admiration for Summers. Back in 2013, Obama had hoped to make Summers chairman of the Federal Reserve, but was forced to settle for Yellen when Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee blocked his man.
Republicans take a different view. They are willing to give people a tax break to defray health insurance costs, and some Republicans are even willing to extend assistance to lower-income people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes. But Republicans reject the idea of government guaranteeing coverage, and their proposals to replace Obamacare wouldn't even attempt to provide such a guarantee.
It's a point the Warren campaign has been hammering over the past month, downplaying her history of challenging other Democrats and arguing she's uniquely qualified to bridge the party's ideological, age, gender and racial divides. Some allies have gone further and argued it positions her well for a potential contested convention.
Congress created the one-time coronavirus rebate payments in order to help people get through the social distancing measures ordered by state and local governments to slow the spread of the virus. More than 16,000 Americans have died from it as of Friday morning, and more than 16 million have lost their jobs and filed unemployment claims.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of President Donald Trump's failed presidential campaign played key roles in orchestrating the Washington rally that spawned a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to an Associated Press review of records, undercutting claims the event was the brainchild of the president's grassroots supporters.
Republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.
Wren was involved in at least one call before the pro-Trump rally with members of several groups listed as rally participants to organize credentials for VIP attendees, according to Kimberly Fletcher, the president of one of those groups, Moms for America.
Evgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter.
Works in: Web Development Annual Salary: $100-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50-69 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $1K I don't actually have a 401k through my job, but I do put $1K a month into a brokerage account; I'm allowed to cash in at any time, but the plan is that I won't. I'm pretty good about making coffee at home and buying K-cups.
No objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like Larry Swedroe, John Bogle, Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of Wall Street. Movies like The Big Short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. But don't be fooled. While the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.
Largely, the schedule is set by the Secret Service. We do what they want us to, he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews just before the plane's departure. I don't set the schedule. I have nothing to do with it.
This costs a little more than your traditional snorkel but has two design enhancements you will definitely want. The breathing chamber is designed to eliminate fogging and make it easier to breath. This also has a GoPro mount to fit an action camera.
And that wasn't the only tense moment between the two.
Believe it or not, Senator Elizabeth Warren is closer to Milton Friedman's description of a conservative than Speaker Paul Ryan. But you'd never know it because the mainstream media has tagged Warren as a Progressive and Ryan as a Conservative. Milton Friedman, the godfather of free market conservatism, believed the market worked best when the government didn't pick winners and losers. Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing.
If you do receive an unsolicited email purporting to be from the Census Bureau and requesting you to complete a survey, you can bet that you're dealing with a scam artist, Tomaschek said. The best thing to do in such a case is to delete the email.
The Senate also blocked President Barack Obama's gun control package in 2013, following the Sandy Hook shooting. Significant legislative action on gun control remains in the states.
A policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want, Krugman wrote.
The conventional wisdom is that because the agency overseeing food aid is shut down, benefits for 38 million Americans may disappear after February. President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year.
Politifacts [sic] looked at it and they doctored the photo, they doctored the piece and it's acknowledged that it's a fake, Biden responded. What we're doing is we're putting out what the actual exchange between [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan and I were. And I have been a gigantic supporter of Social Security from the beginning.
We Need To Pull This Party Together
NEWARK, N.J. ― Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who announced his presidential candidacy on Friday morning, defended his record against criticism from the left later in the day during a news conference outside of his home.
In his op-ed, Summers charged that Biden would burn up all of his political and economic space to address those issues by supporting American families.
I've also kept Airbnb out of my Toronto building and have written about the so-called sharing economy (which includes Uber) and the public concerns they raise.
The IRS granted Women for America First tax-exempt status as a social welfare organization a year ago, with the exemption retroactive to February 2019. The AP requested that the group provide any tax records it may have filed since then, but received no response.
The result would be some fairly dramatic shifts in who gets insurance, how much they pay for it, and, eventually, what kind of insurance they have. This isn't accidental. The decision to restructure financial assistance for insurance flows directly from the very different way Republicans and Democrats think about health care.
Scheer also criticized Trudeau for refusing to greenlight the Northern Gateway pipeline and said the prime minister killed the Energy East pipeline with last minute rule changes and regulations.
Another website, TrumpMarch.com shows a fist-raised Trump pictured on the front of a red, white and blue tour bus emblazoned with the words, Powered by Women for America First. The logo for the bedding company My Pillow is also prominent. Mike Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow, is an ardent Trump supporter who's falsely claimed Trump didn't lose the election to Biden and will serve another four-year term as president.

If you're sitting at your desk right now longing for change, know that you may have more tools than you think to get the career you want.
The problem is that this results in a comically extreme disparity between the treatment of imported, domestic, and exported goods. Some examples:
His support for Tillerson may be more political than personal. Musk joined Trump's economic advisory team last month, along with the chief executives of General Motors, Uber Technologies and other big firms. He met with the newly sworn-in president on Monday to discuss the future of U.S. manufacturing, of which Tesla aims to be a big part. The company is building factories in Nevada and New York.
A pro-Trump nonprofit group called Women for America First hosted the Save America Rally on Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an oval-shaped, federally owned patch of land near the White House. But an attachment to the National Park Service public gathering permit granted to the group lists more than half a dozen people in staff positions for the event who just weeks earlier had been paid thousands of dollars by Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Other staff scheduled to be on site during the demonstration have close ties to the White House.
Your customers aren't thinking about you or your business.
And as the Sanders campaign is fond of noting, Biden has a long history of endorsing Social Security benefit cuts dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.
In phone surveys, staffers said, CA's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (Different models have differing levels of accuracy, Nix said in his response. I suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. In many previous articles the Cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) By September, CA's first six-month contract was up. A CA employee in the campaign's Houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and Wilson happened to fish it out. The invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that Wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. I can't fucking believe it, Wilson told Roe, who concurred. Jeff Roe (left) with Ted Cruz (right), who ultimately fell out of Rebekah Mercer's favor. We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon, a Cruz adviser said. ETHAN MILLER/GETTY IMAGES Nix disputed this account too, noting that the firm's fee was clearly stated in our statement of work and contract. However, a former consultant for the campaign, Tommy Sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. There was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through March 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. The heartburn felt by the Cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by September 1, 2015. When the Cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued.
A Secret Service spokesperson told HuffPost: The U.S. Secret Service works in conjunction with the administration on all presidential and First Family visits as our primary concern is the safety and security of those that we protect.
For products that will be sold to consumers, most companies employ a Most Significant Digit (MSD) pricing strategy. Why? Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the 2 in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant.
Clearly, both sides are playing a giant game, with the stock market as the game board, said Pam Krueger, founder and CEO of Wealthramp, a referral service for financial advisers.
Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has warned the next administration that easing Trump administration policies, including a halt to wall construction, would lead to a surge of people seeking to cross the border, creating an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.
When it comes to scams, the web is the Wild West. There are a multitude of ways criminals can trick you into sharing personal information ― even when you think you are not.
If you are making a radical pivot that is not reflected in your formal education, career experts advise putting your self-studies, such as LinkedIn learning courses and digital bootcamps you have taken, at the top of your résumé. That way, a recruiter skimming the page can easily understand your reasons for a career leap and how you're working toward it.

Florida state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat whose district includes the MorseLife compound, said it's appalling that the wealthy were given exclusive access to the vaccine while older residents of his district and throughout Florida have been struggling to get shots. Phone systems for scheduling appointments have crashed and older residents of some counties where the vaccine has been distributed on a first-come, first-served basis have been forced to camp out overnight to get inoculated.
The Post, citing unnamed sources, said that talks about deferring taxes for airlines, hotels and cruise businesses are fluid and haven't been determined. It wasn't immediately clear if Trump's own hotels would be beneficiaries of tax breaks under consideration.
Why on earth would you want to do that? she asked. Those international kids are taking seats away from American students.
Back in 2009, many if not most mainstream economists believed that excessive government budget deficits were a bigger threat to society than weak growth or prolonged unemployment. Going too big wouldn't just risk overheating ― it raised the prospect of a second financial crisis that could bring down the dollar and even American political hegemony.
By the time he wrote the letter to Frantz, Gandhi had already emerged as a leading figure in India's movement for independence from British rule. He had inspired thousands of followers to boycott British institutions and encouraged many to replace imported British goods with items produced in India.
With a 12-year-old son at home, Webley is eligible for $1,700 ― but the free tax sites wouldn't let her file, and she didn't have any luck with a separate new TurboTax program that is supposed to work better than existing free software.
In a recent example, 92-year-old Dallas resident Robert Cooper received an authentic-looking census package in the mail in December. The form asked for personal details, such as age, education and who else lived with him. It also asked for his and his wife's Medicare numbers, the Dallas Morning News reported.
Our staff received communications from people in March, April, and May saying things like, 'I can afford to buy products, but the stores don't have any in stock and I'm getting my period soon. Is there any way to get some from you? I will donate when I can!' Marlowe told HuffPost.
The verdict? Overall, these women are doing a startlingly good job of budgeting. Maybe I should ask them to talk me out of the cortado I just ordered.
Sean Hannity is losing it over progressive Democrats' Green New Deal, a policy proposal that would push the country toward 100 percent renewable energy over about a decade.
Sanders is a leading candidate. He's rising in the polls. He looks poised to win the caucuses in Nevada and have a strong showing on Super Tuesday, March 3.
Car manufacturers, the host said, would also hurt if multimillionaires were asked to contribute more to benefit social programs.
While global businesses have become accustomed to finding new markets and identifying ways to hedge risk, they are less adept at fundamentally altering their business models. Some U.S. businesses are already canceling plans to build foreign production facilities abroad. Some foreign businesses are already purchasing insurance in the event their U.S. investment proposals are not approved in the coming months. There is great unease about what the trade and investment regime will turn out to be 6 or 12 months from now, and with good reason. The paradigm shift that voters in the U.S., UK, the Philippines and elsewhere have ushered in is about to start sending shock waves around the world.
Federal Conservatives wasted no time blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for Kinder Morgan's decision to suspend work on its Trans Mountain pipeline, even as the company lauds federal support for the project.
So put me on record this thing is probably too crazy to be real. It's quite likely House Speaker Paul Ryan is just using the public's current attention to the trade deficit as an excuse to get this plan in circulation with the real intention of dialing it back to something less kooky but still lavishly rewarding to his corporate sponsors.
Exactly how much money you will need for your move depends on your comfort with risk. Ortega said some people fall into the Screw it, I'm leaving camp, while others who are risk-averse may need a longer period of time to plan and build a bigger emergency fund.
Republicans supported trillions in pandemic relief spending last year, but at a confirmation hearing for Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Republicans prodded the former chair of the Federal Reserve about how much spending is too much.

The newspapers reported that the vaccinations were organized by MorseLife CEO Keith Myers and New Jersey-based developer David Mack, who is a member of various MorseLife boards and chairman of the country club foundation's board. The vaccines were distributed at the Joseph L. Morse Health Center, which is on David S. Mack Drive.
I agree with the glowing reviews of The Big Short. The film does a wonderful job of exposing the mendacity of the financial industry and the role it played in almost causing a worldwide economic collapse.
Her allies routinely cite polling showing a wide swath of Democratic voters are still considering backing her and that she is the nominee who would disappoint the smallest portion of Democrat voters.
Women for America First, which applied for and received the Park Service permit, did not respond to messages seeking comment about how the event was financed and about the Trump campaign's involvement. The rally drew tens of thousands of people.
He previewed a presidential run that is likely to focus on uplift, appealing to American decency and goodness to overcome the divisiveness that has consumed the country under Trump.
Bloomberg should have expected these hits. His record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week. Yet he appeared unprepared on all fronts. He was muted in his defense of stop-and-frisk policies. He chalked up the harassment complaints to maybe they didn't like a joke I told, refusing to free the women at his companies from the NDAs they'd signed, and didn't have an answer for why he has yet to release his tax returns other than to say he's working on it.
The amount of abbreviation and jargon I see when it's just how you've always talked for years ― you forget that other people don't know, she said.
Patrick Murray, the Monmouth pollster who conducted the survey, noted the lack of a competitive Republican primary and said it meant more moderate and even some conservative voters would cast ballots on the Democratic side, causing problems for a progressive like Warren, who supports a wealth tax, mass student debt forgiveness and the decriminalization of border crossings.
Let's refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.
But the tax credits in the Republican bills are different from the Affordable Care Act's. Instead of adjusting the value to account for premiums and income, as the law does today, the Republican plans envision tax credits whose value would vary based only on age. In the leaked bill, for instance, 25-year-olds would get $2,000 a year, while 55-year-olds would get $3,500. It wouldn't matter how much these people make, or what insurance costs in their communities.
The Democratic presidential candidates didn't come to the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas to be nice.
For people who filed tax returns for 2018 or already filed for 2019, and who have bank information on file with the IRS, the rebate checks should hit their accounts soon. Individuals earning less than $75,000 are eligible for $1,200 and couples earning less than $150,000 are eligible for $2,400, plus $500 per child younger than 17.
In almost all cases, pricing strategies should begin with a Gross Profit Margin Target (GPMT) strategy. Companies typically know the gross profit margin they need to pay back their expenses and generate positive net income and cash flow. Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want. If you don't, there are some common guidelines you can follow.
Naturally, the same week we kick-start a nat'l convo on marginal tax rates endorsed by Nobel-Prize winning economists, I'm being described as 'vacuous,' tweeted Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday.
Whether or not that rosy assessment turns out to be correct remains to be seen. What is certain is that Wall Street will profit handsomely from the sale of these investments, regardless of how they actually perform.
Dupont Circle has been known as Washington's central neighborhood for gay life and business for decades. It is a trendy area filled with art galleries, bars, nightclubs and shops. Black business owners weren't seeing themselves represented in this vibrant area, prompting some entrepreneurs to plant roots in the neighborhood to try and attract black customers.
As one of his first acts as Illinois' newly elected governor, Democrat J.B. Pritzker signed legislation Jan. 17 that further regulates gun stores throughout the state by requiring certifications.
You're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience, Buttigieg said. You're on the committee that oversees border security. You're on the committee that does trade. You're literally in part of the committee that's overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.

Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump's presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.
For much of his adult life, Gandhi earnestly studied the religions of the world. He read the Quran, Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and the writings of Leo Tolstoy on Christianity. He was deeply influenced by the Bhagavad Gita, one of the core religious texts in Hinduism, and remained a committed Hindu for the rest of his life.

Every president wants to look on the bright side of his achievements, of course, and people will debate whether a bigger bill was politically possible until the end of time. But Obama's optimistic assessment of the 2009 Recovery Act rings hollow today not only for its statistical muddles. Over the past few years, a new intellectual consensus has emerged about how the economy works and what the government's proper role in managing it should be.

While the future of government operations and Trump's border wall remain unclear, Democrats and Republicans have until Feb. 15 to find a solution before key parts of the government could again grind to a halt.
During Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans often insisted that any spending on relief for workers be offset by cuts to other parts of the budget, even though the sums at stake typically represented a tiny fraction of what Republicans approved in the Trump years.
Tax avoidance by some of the richest and biggest corporations, which are using various loopholes to move their headquarters to various off-shore locations in order not to pay taxes, should be banned and declared illegal. Over the last decades, billions of dollars supposed to be paid on account of taxes, were successfully moved out of the country and pocketed by directors of such corporations. The theory that such untaxed money is used to start new enterprises and create jobs for Americans proved to be totally flawed. Rich are not starting new businesses that create more jobs. Instead, by-and-large, they end up hoarding their tax-avoided funds in their offshore accounts ... or ... buying out small start-ups to stifle the entrepreneurship that might compete with their hegemony. Morally and justly speaking, this money is tax payers' money that should be returned to the public purse for the benefit of the country.
As with so many scams, this scam exploits a kernel of truth, which is that the Census Bureau is looking for people to fill thousands of temporary positions, Weisman said. However, the scammers are using this as an opportunity to make you a victim of identity theft or steal your money.
The federal government is reopening for at least three weeks, but the prospect of a repeat looms. A second shutdown threatens to kick in Feb. 15 if Congress can't cut a deal on President Donald Trump's demand for money to build a border wall.

But, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which significantly loosened restrictions on political spending, Rebekah decided it was time to save America from becoming like socialist Europe, as she has put it to several people. She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant. (I love the fact that you're telling your story, but I'm the one giving the interview, he told me in a conversation.) Alexander Nix at Cambridge Analytica's New York office.
Tax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, Krugman noted. And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.
Those who don't owe federal income taxes are not normally required to file returns, so the requirement presented a new hassle to the 15 million households that didn't file in 2019 ― and volunteer tax clinics are currently shut down.

The World Bank's green bonds carried the exact same interest rate as did the Bank's other bonds. In other words, if investors wanted the Bank to invest in water pollution reduction projects, they could buy a green bond with, say, a 4% rate of interest. On the other hand, if they wanted to buy one of the Bank's other bonds that were financing, say, a coalmine, an urban highway or some other environmentally atrocious project, they could buy a regular World Bank bond that was also paying 4%. So, what is different about green bonds? Well, they assuage the conscience of sensitive investors. They make them feel good. They are Feel Good Bonds.
Have fun with it, but keep it relevant.
The violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot, said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center's Immigrant Justice Project. The president's planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence.
LAS VEGAS ― President Donald Trump's choice to stay at his own Las Vegas hotel each night during the western states swing that wraps up Friday likely cost taxpayers a million extra dollars as well as diverted thousands of them into his own cash registers.

Medicaid enrollees in states that adopt a block grant or per-capita cap could face new barriers to care, including monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and they could be kicked off the program for failing to pay.
Since the start of January, Warren has sought to capitalize on escalating intra-party tensions caused by Sanders's rise in the polls by offering herself as a way to satiate both of the party's ideological wings while remaining acceptable to Black and Latino voters. (This is intended to separate her from Buttigieg, who has also positioned himself as the middle ground but struggles with voters of color.)
But Democrats are calling on the Treasury Department to go even further, urging them to set specific conditions — that will apply beyond the coronavirus crisis — on taxpayer funds that go to corporations.
At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women.
The central issue is not economic. It's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. Such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.

To be sure, Republicans who still control most state legislatures likely will pass gun rights legislation. At least 26 state bills would significantly expand gun access, according to the Giffords Law Center.
When you sell investments in a nonretirement account at a profit, you have to pay a capital gains tax. In 2020, the capital gains rate is either 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your income and filing status ― that is, unless you held the asset for less than a year. In that case, your earnings are taxed as ordinary income according to current tax brackets. And keep in mind that your stock market earnings could bump you into a higher bracket.

(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street.
But Airbnb doesn't protect guests either by not vetting hosts. Recently, Las Vegas police arrested a host for filming with hidden cameras the bedrooms of his Airbnb rental for purposes unknown, possibly blackmail or pornography. Guests also have no knowledge as to who else has keys to their space.

Whether or not new shenanigans by Wall Street will precipitate another financial crisis is an open question. It certainly doesn't appear that lessons have been learned from the last go-around.
Even before the pandemic, with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and no recession or national emergency, Republicans abandoned their prior calls for fiscal discipline and added nearly $4 trillion to the national debt through tax cuts and new spending.
When you are pricing your products, what gives you control over the price is the uniqueness built into your positioning, or branding, strategy. If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C. Best of luck.

In a statement, the president's reelection campaign said it did not organize, operate or finance the event. No campaign staff members were involved in the organization or operation of the rally, according to the statement. It said that if any former employees or independent contractors for the campaign took part, they did not do so at the direction of the Trump campaign.
To address the severe economic shock currently gripping the country, the Trump administration is working on an emergency stimulus proposal of at least $1 trillion that includes $50 billion in loans for the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the crisis. The package calls for an additional $150 billion in loans for unnamed severely distressed sectors of the economy. According to The Washington Post, those might include hotels, casinos, cruise lines, and the oil and gas industry. Other groups are also lining up for a lifeline, including restaurant chains, the nation's mayors, and nonprofit groups.
Trump promised to balance the budget when he was campaigning to be president, but the national debt has now reached an all-time American record of more than $23 trillion. (Who the hell cares about the budget? Trump asked donors at a fundraiser in January.)

But as Warren stumbles out of a third-place finish in Iowa and seeks the game-changing result in New Hampshire that she failed to get in the Midwest, her pitch has a problem: Many of the voters she needs to win over aren't Democrats at all. Public polling here has shown Warren running strong with registered Democrats but performing poorly with the independents who plan to cast ballots in the Democratic race and often play a crucial role in Granite State politics.

If the public understood that Senator Warren is, in truth, a free market conservative and Speaker Ryan is a plutocratic proponent and not a free market conservative, don't you think that it might have an impact? Its time to end he said she said reporting. Its time for the media to analyze the various tax proposals and reveal them for what they are. Fortunately, Tax Notes provides a forum for experts to do just that. The real question is whether the New York Times and the rest of the general media will translate that information we provide into terms that the public can understand so they have the information they need to make rational decisions.

Rebekah was incensed that Trump had a tougher immigration policy than Cruz did—she particularly liked Trump's idea for a total ban on Muslims. Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him.
Warren's support is coming from traditionally liberal Democratic women, Murray said. When you only have one primary, you're going to get more independent voters who are further from the ideological extreme of the party. In this case, you're getting more voters from the center, or either more towards the right.
Ocasio-Cortez has been an outspoken proponent for reopening the government, as the partial shutdown hits its 18th day.

Rebekah Mercer was impressed by Nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue.
He is particularly upset about an idea from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people.

The Canadian Revenue Agency should force Airbnb, Uber and others to issue T4 income slips to all Airbnb hosts or Uber drivers so they pay taxes on their income. These T4s should also be sent to landlords or condo boards so they know what's going on as well as with other levels of government.
I was able to change my seatmate's mind, but overall there remains a lack of knowledge on the broader impact these international students provide. Like any industry facing rising costs and falling income, colleges and universities have been looking for ways to grow revenue.

So I'm running for president because I believe in us, I believe in these values, I'm going to put them before the American people ― hey, and if that's not what they want, then I won't be the next president of the United States.
Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who had to rebuild the Justice Department after controversies during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost that Biden understands that he needs to give the attorney general the space that he or she needs to restore integrity and the independence of the Justice Department.
The rise in inequality is widening at an alarming rate. Top 1 percent controlling 95 percent of the overall wealth is causing the rest of Americans to head to the poor house. America's financial elite has put a stranglehold on American citizens to the point of determining the quality of their life (or lack of it). They are effectively controlling the country's economic and political agenda through their powerful lobbies and monetary contributions to politicians and decision makers of their choice.
We wanted to combine the power of food, culture and community to foster an environment that welcomes and encourages artistic expression, cultural exploration and diverse experiences in hopes that, together, we can reimagine what's possible for our culture and community in D.C. and beyond, Rule told HuffPost.
In 1990 I published an article entitled Why Political Risk Insurance Will Grow in the 1990s. At that time, the former Soviet Union had recently disintegrated, the Gulf War was about to commence, and there was general uncertainty about where the world was headed. I predicted at that time that political risk insurance (PRI) would grow dramatically because of enhanced demand. Indeed, it did. The PRI industry stands at a similar precipice today. With the looming possibility of trade wars, a deterioration in investment climates, and ever tightening lending standards, there is every reason to believe that, as much as the industry has grown - and that growth has been dramatic over the past 25 years - it also stands to grow dramatically in the coming 5-10 years.
In an interview after the event, Thompson praised Warren: She understands intersectionality. For too long, marginalized people have been placed on the back burner. But he also said he was under no illusion about how much demand voters in New Hampshire, the third-whitest state in the union, might have for racial justice.
The New York State Attorney General's Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors.
Here's what you can start doing now while you prepare to make the leap:
Castro, in an interview after his speech, punted when asked if Warren needed to place more emphasis on her past intra-party clashes: I'll leave the political analysis to the campaign.
OK, so Budweiser isn't having an ad, but its parent company is? Sure. Whatever. Is someone going to do something about those horses?

Finally, if you're job hunting, keep an eye out for scams related to census jobs. Scammers are posting job applications for people interested in temporary positions with the Census Bureau.
Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare, Biden said at the time. That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.
Concluding that it was definitely worth a shot, DC Water, the District, the US Department of Justice and the EPA agreed to amend their consent order. The agreement was that DC Water would build about 300 acres of green infrastructure. Before jumping into a massive 300+/- acre project that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars, DC Water decided to experiment with 25 acres first to see what the green infrastructure would actually cost and, second, how much water flow it would actually reduce. So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was.
According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics.
Moore stressed that we shouldn't be supporting anything that requires someone who's not paid working for us, telling the audience to avoid flying and filing tax returns, suggesting they opt for extensions instead so as to avoid the need for workers.
That makes the census a perfect vehicle for identity thieves to pose as census workers in an effort to lure you into providing personal information that will be used to make you a victim of identity theft, said Weisman.
She gave the example of someone switching from the hospitality industry to logistics. If you're in hospitality and you had to work with suppliers and vendors and plan shipments or anything like that ― even though it was under that hospitality industry, those things are still transferable to new industries, Hernandez said.
They plan to provide newer brands shelf space to showcase their products and provide feedback from consumers and industry professionals to help them thrive in the market.
On his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)

During the signing ceremony, Pritzker said he wanted to tackle more gun control legislation, including a ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks — devices that allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire automatically.
In exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their Medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. Depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult Medicaid enrollees.
Ever since Paul Ryan 1st proposed paying for Trump's tax breaks to the top 1% by cutting Social Security & Medicare, I've been proud to be by @BernieSanders side fighting against it.
Weiss-Wolf is heartened to see local nonprofits meet the moment with such distribution efforts, but said she hopes to see the day when they won't be shouldering so much of the burden.
McKinsey & Co. ran a rough analysis on the leaked House bill, and presented its findings to a meeting of the nation's governors over the weekend. Some presently uninsured young people would get coverage, McKinsey's analysts predicted, because the GOP's tax credits would make insurance more financially attractive. But those gains would be more than offset by older people dropping insurance as it suddenly became a lot more expensive. Overall, McKinsey's researchers said, non-group insurance ― that is, coverage for people buying on their own ― would decline by 30 percent to 50 percent.
A few minutes after snapping back at Boot's column, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted another missive that said: Let's refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.
You are looking for professional, academic and technical skills that can be easily translated to that other industry, Jessica Hernandez, a career development coach, told HuffPost.
Look, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, You are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, Biden said. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works.

The federal government would still be spending a lot of money on tax breaks for people getting health care. But it wouldn't steer that money in the way that the Affordable Care Act does ― in other words, it wouldn't target people who struggle the most with medical bills.
Warren later added Klobuchar's plan was only two paragraphs to really drive the point home.
Joe Biden has a 40-year history of trying to cut Social Security, and he is doing everything he can to hide that record from voters. You can see Biden's record right here for yourself in 3 videos:

Ever since its inception, privately controlled Fed's monetary policies have been benefiting mostly the rich elite enabling them to widen the gap of inequality to historical levels. The Fed's time has passed. By admitting their own mistakes, it is becoming clear that the present day economy is dictating the Feds' policies and not the other way around. The Fed should be abolished and the monetary policies of America put into hands of elected politicians who must find a way to lessen inequality amongst its citizens.

They're very much antiestablishment, Murray said of the independent voters who are backing Sanders. If she had done that, she might've been able to dig into some of Bernie's independents.
DC Water's engineers told them that the project was likely to reduce flows between 18.6% and 41.3%. They said there was a 95% confidence interval that these goals would be reached. On the other hand, there was a 2.5% probability that the flow reduction would be below 18.6% AND a 2.5% probability that the flows would be reduced by more than 41.3%. The project was slated to cost about $25 million.
The concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.

The Warren campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.
More than 70 million people in the United States were covered by Medicaid as of December, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 30 million potentially could be subject to the new Trump limits on the program's funding, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

The department has been taken off a road that I think it's basically been on since the Nixon administration, where there's been that separation of the Justice Department from the White House, Holder told HuffPost ahead of the election. You really need to look at the department as a whole. The people there, both in the field and at Main Justice, their motives have been called into question, their patriotism has been called into question, and all of that has to be dealt with. The department has got to be restored to what it was and what it must always be and clearly not what it is now.

Where were you when you learned about the cow fart tax? For some of us, it was when we were watching this commercial.
Unfortunately, most tax reform talk these days focuses on the supposed need to lower America's official corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. But as the example of Microsoft proves, that rate is easily sidestepped. Numerous studies have found that, after all their deductions, credits and other breaks, corporations actually pay only about half the official rate. And all those profits stashed offshore have only been taxed at 6 per cent, because they are mostly in tax havens. A huge loophole lets U.S. corporations avoid income taxes on those profits until they are brought home--which may never happen.
Regardless of how you're contacted by the Census Bureau, however, there are a few pieces of information the census will never ask for.
Unfortunately, for months the left and the mainstream media told the American people that violence was an acceptable political tool, she said. They were wrong. It is not.
If experience isn't super solid for whatever reason, but then [applicants] are showing that they've gone to hackathons on the weekends ... or things on their own, that shows determination, that shows focus, it's self-motivation, and those kind of candidates are definitely highlighted in my experience, Alison Daley, the founder of a tech recruiting and training platform called Recruiting Innovation, previously told HuffPost. Moxie and determination sure compensate for certain education pedigrees.
Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email to The Associated Press that the governor has been extremely clear that vaccine should only be administered to Florida's seniors 65 and older, frontline health care workers, and long-term care facility residents and staff.
It's important not to make this transactional and ask them for a job, which may turn people off in a first encounter. Rather, you're asking them for information and actionable advice. Once you have a lot of these conversations, you'll start to notice patterns in these career paths, and in the meantime, you'll build relationships that could eventually lead to a referral, Hernandez said.
The President is holding gov operations hostage so that he can build a monument to himself on the southern border that the maj of Americans don't want. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 8, 2019
As then-President Barack Obama's vice president, Biden served as Obama's liaison to Senate Republicans at a time when Obama had put a cut to Social Security cost-of-living adjustment on the table in pursuit of grand bargain that would also increase tax revenue. Obama would make that technical change, the chained consumer price index, part of his 2013 budget resolution, prompting a White House protest where Sanders spoke.

This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State, Musk wrote in the tweet.
It came as Labour announced the party will help councils bring services back in house, set up new energy companies and develop local economies using a team of experts. Speaking in Preston Thursday, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will unveil the new 'Community Wealth Building Unit'. Preston City Council is reported to have returned almost £200m to the local economy and supported more than 1,600 jobs by using the town's anchor institutions and council contracts to and develop cooperatives. Tory austerity has blighted our communities and forced councils to cut and privatise many public services that we all rely on, he will say. The next Labour government will end austerity and properly fund local authorities, instead of cutting back and passing the buck like the Conservatives are doing. But we cannot afford to wait until we are in power nationally. Tory peer Lord Porter said local authorities face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2020, but children's services was the area most in need of urgent attention. He said: The LGA has warned about the urgent need to address the £2bn funding gap facing children's services. A child is being referred to council children's services every 49 seconds on a daily basis and councils started more than 500 child protection investigations every day last year - up from 200 a decade ago. This unprecedented surge in demand shows no sign of abating.

If you want to pick stocks, ask yourself what companies are poised for long-term growth, said Trevor Ward, a certified public accountant and financial planner at Kinetic Financial. Consider what competitive edge that company has and how it is changing its industry. Ward also recommended looking at its finances ― compare debt to assets and stock price to earnings. You should also understand who makes up the management team.

During a brief speech to the gathered supporters, Castro discussed the first time he met Warren.

It's not for lack of effort. At the end, the film raises the ominous possibility that this sordid history is about to repeat itself. An article in Bloomberg notes that Goldman Sachs, together with other banks, is selling a new investment it calls a bespoke tranche opportunity. The article explains that these investments are essentially a CDO backed by single-name credit-default swaps, customized based on investors' wishes. The pools of derivatives are cut into varying slices of risk that are sold to investors such as hedge funds.
There's such a wealth of inappropriate conduct coming from the Trump administration that I think that they're actually going to have to prioritize what they'll look at, Holder said. If you looked at all the negative things, all the inappropriate things, you would spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the inappropriate conduct by Cabinet members, White House officials, the president himself, and that could inhibit the ability of the new administration to focus on what the American people want them to focus on. But, Holder added, You can't simply let it go. People need to be held accountable.

(Clockwise, starting top right) Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz, Alexander Nix All modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. Roe, the straight-talking manager of the Cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. He has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. In the case of the Cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was Cambridge Analytica. And it wasn't long before Roe and his team suspected that Nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. On March 4, 2015, Cruz, Roe, Wilson and others gathered in the Hyatt in Washington D.C. for an all-day meeting with Nix and a group of CA senior executives. Wilson took notes on his computer. According to multiple members of the Cruz team, Wilson was dismayed to learn that CA's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. As far as the team could tell, the only data CA possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from Facebook. In addition, they recalled, CA hadn't set itself up with Data Trust, the Republican National Committee's repository of voter information.
There's been a flood of new legislation, he said. With more state legislatures in Democratic hands, with the sense you can enforce new gun laws and it not be a stigma, there's not only momentum but concrete evidence that those who want to see stronger gun laws are making headway.

In fact, 63% of workers who lost jobs because of COVID-19 have changed industries, according to a Harris Poll survey of more than 1,970 Americans conducted in October. The top reasons people gave for making a career switch were being laid off or fearing a layoff, needing more money, and feeling like there was no room for growth in their field.

In my view, the goal of Wall Street -- under the guise of managing your money -- is to maximize the transfer of your assets to itself and to avoid regulation that would hinder its attempt to do so. It succeeds in these efforts through massive contributions to congressional campaigns. In 2014, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a securities industry trade group, was the top contributor on Wall Street to these campaigns, investing more than $7.4 million.
The opposite is true. Republicans made clear this week they will not support even emergency economic relief from a Democratic president. Democrats will have no choice but to go it alone, and passing a popular bill will not hurt their ability to pass additional popular measures in the coming months. The economic growth enabled by Biden's COVID-19-relief bill will not crowd out other investments, but produce an expanding economy in which more investments are possible. His next bill to reform the mangled international trade system and update American infrastructure must be every bit as ambitious as his COVID-19 relief legislation, and Biden stated emphatically last month that it would be.
Since the financial meltdown, salaried employees have financed the cutting of expenses. Too many jobs and profits have gone bye bye. According to Bloomberg, US companies are keeping $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes. Some pay less income tax than you and I. When consumers have less money to spend, this creates a vicious cycle, which hurts these companies too. To help avoid these problems, many believe it is preferably to focus on revenue to increase profits because that can produce more win-win situations where all boats rise. Where does revenue come from? It's the result of price times quantity (Revenue = Price x Quantity).
In South Carolina, a proposal to add a 7 percent sales tax on guns to fund school resource officers was quickly dismissed by the state's Republican governor.
The Subcommittee, using Microsoft as Exhibit 1 of corporate tax abuse, called for real reforms. But nothing happened because corporate lobbyists control the agenda.

Political risk exists everywhere, as does uncertainty about how, when, or whether it will manifest itself in ways detrimental to international traders, investors, and lenders. For decades, conventional wisdom dictated that developing and emerging countries were the greatest sources of such risk, due to the absence of meaningful and enforceable laws, the prevalence of corruption, lack of financial resources, and security concerns. That of course remains the case, but as has been proven as a result of the Great Recession, the global war on terror, corruption scandals and growing income disparity, developed countries contribute every bit as much as those 'other' countries to the rising risks associated with cross-border transactions.

Washington, D.C., one of the blackest cities in America, has been experiencing an economic renaissance for nearly two decades — but that renaissance is considered nothing more than gentrification by longtime residents. According to the D.C. Chamber of Commerce's State of the Business Report, whiter and richer families are increasingly displacing low- and middle-income families. As affluent families move in, higher rents push out black residents, and black businesses leave with them.
It's not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations.
Phishing emails, for example, have long been a tool used by scammers to collect personal information or install malware on the user's device. The census is no exception; a popular phishing tactic for census scammers is sending an email requesting that you take a survey. However, the Census Bureau will never contact you via email to complete a survey.

If you don't fill out a form or self-report your census information by web, phone or mail, a census taker will come to your door to interview you some time in the next couple of months. If you aren't around, they'll come back a few times, or they may resort to asking neighbors for information about your household. This is all perfectly normal and legal.
Instead, he cast himself as a champion of higher public school teacher pay and better school funding that would enable more hiring of teachers, counselors and mental health professionals. One way he suggested to address the issue is by reforming the tax code so young stockbrokers, who may benefit from the carried-interest loophole or the lower tax rate on capital gains, don't pay a lower tax rate than teachers.

Today, by contrast, economists increasingly accept the idea that deficits are not inherently destabilizing, but a normal part of economic management. The price of going too big isn't a crash, but a little unwanted inflation ― something that can be reined in through Federal Reserve policymaking or some tax increases from Congress. These may be unpleasant when they come, but it will be much worse for people to lose jobs, incomes and homes in the meantime. When the costs of going too small are shattered families and broken faith in a shared national project, the choice is not difficult.
Before this point, Rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called Ruby et Violette. Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. I know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate.

With this economic boom, the tax base in Washington, D.C., has grown, but so has racial inequality, Hyra told HuffPost. There's a study by the Urban Institute that shows that white household wealth is 81 times that of black family wealth. There's immense inequality in the city.
You may receive false census documents meant to coax personal information from you, as Cooper did. Similarly, you could receive forms that are designed to look like official census mail, but are intended to confuse you and lead to inaccurate census counts. For example, Republicans were caught last month sending out mailers titled 2020 Congressional District Census, in envelopes labeled Do not destroy, official document, which mirrored the look of the official census form. However, these forms were not related to the census at all.

The Anticipated Rise In Medicaid Enrollment
The one thing that concerns me that nobody seems to be talking about anymore is the massive amount of debt that we continue to rack up as a nation and in fact, the president-elect has proposed a couple trillion dollars fiscal plan on top of that which we've already done, said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). Nobody seems to care much about it.
As the U.S. enters a period of unprecedented post-war political instability, many businesses are wondering how to plan for the near and medium-term future. Decision makers in business sometimes have short memories; a preoccupation with making profit will continue to cloud the judgement of some of them. Recent headlines have stated how optimistic some business leaders are about America's future, believing that the pro-business platform about to be implemented is a stairway to heaven. It may well be. A significant reduction in corporate tax rates combined with an orientation toward America First could indeed propel the U.S. economy to heights unseen in decades -- at least, in the short-term.

After 7 years of post-recession slow growth, numerous quantitative easing (QE) stimuli, and a doubling of U.S. federal debt, the economy is barely limping on at a stall speed. According to industry experts such as Lacy Hunt, since the introduction of unconventional and untested monetary policy operations like QE, an impressive amount of empirical evidence has emerged that casts considerable doubt on their efficacy. Ex-voting member of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher went even further. He told a rare bit of truth-ness in a CNBC interview last year; What the Fed did, and I was part of it, was front-loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect...and an uncomfortable digestion period is likely now. The wealth effect did not benefit an average American. In fact, America's middle-class lost nearly 30% of its wealth.
Here's what Wall Street doesn't want you to know and is terrified you will find out. Only about 2 percent of active fund managers generate statistically significant alpha (excess returns over their risk-adjusted benchmark).

Even if you could do so, once the impact of taxes is taken into account, it is unlikely even these funds would beat the after-tax returns of low-management-fee index funds.

A phone call was scheduled with Rebekah, Bannon and CA's attorney. I understand she's a nice lady, Wilson says politely of Rebekah. According to multiple people on the call, she accused Wilson of undermining CA. Bannon, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of profanities at the Cruz team. Someone on the call gave me a censored version of his outburst: The only reason this campaign is where it is right now is because of our people and I. My recommendation to the Mercers is just to pull them out of there and we'll have them on another campaign by Monday. Bannon's language was so foul it was difficult to listen to, says one person on the call who had never met him before. Another of the political pros, who knew Bannon well, wasn't shocked. That's Steve doing business, he says. The Cruz team was taken aback by Rebekah's reaction. Some even wondered if she'd been given all the facts. One person who was close to the campaign says, She is somewhere between the daughter of a brilliant hedge fund manager and mathematician and somebody who runs a bakery in New York. She clearly has a skill set, but the skill set we're discussing here regarding the understanding of the value of data and analytics doesn't fall into that area. She is operating under the information she's been given.

When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. (From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside.
The formula for calculating these tax credits is important. It varies based on income, so that you'll get a bigger tax credit if you make less money. The value also varies depending on how much insurance costs in your area ― in particular, the price of the second-cheapest silver plan, which the law treats as a benchmark. (Silver plans, which are less generous than typical employer plans, cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person's medical expenses.)

It's actually not so bad on the import side. Basically, it would force companies to pay their effective corporate tax rate on the value of imported goods. The average corporate tax rate is about 13%, so this would imply approximately a tariff of that amount. (To be fair, the average tax rate on importers is considerably higher, because importing doesn't offer as many loopholes as, say, running a hedge fund, so the de facto tariff would be more.)

If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican party, says a Cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells. The two sides were also diverging ideologically. In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz.

Under the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.

Today, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. The federal government finances more than half of Medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.

Does this mean the end of the type of green bonds discussed above? No. They will still be issued. There may be no financial implications to such bonds, but they do, after all, create good will. They do let investors know that the bond issuers are doing the right thing for the environment with the investors' money. As a matter of fact, DC Water is planning on issuing at least $100 million of green bonds in the near future. The proceeds of these bonds will go for stormwater reduction projects and other projects with direct environmental benefits, just like the World Bank bonds described above. And, soon DC Water will also issue a couple hundred million dollars of regular (non-green) bonds to pay for their other projects.

No one was holding back, but Warren was in a particular fighting mood, and it was a notable shift from past debates.
But ideology can't explain all of Warren's struggles with independents. Sanders, who is to her left, actually does better with independents than with registered Democrats in the Monmouth survey. That's partially because Sanders, who has long refused to officially join the Democratic Party, is seen as a less partisan figure. Warren, who rocketed to liberal fame in part because of her willingness to take on other Democrats, has downplayed her past criticisms in an attempt to become a consensus, unifying figure.

Warren has always balanced her criticisms of other Democrats with a team player attitude, hosting fundraisers for Senate candidates and using her robust email list to help other Democrats raise money. But throughout the 2020 campaign, Warren has often declined to engage in critiques of other Democrats, and her campaign has positioned her as the pragmatic progressive in contrast to Sanders's willingness to declare war on the establishment.

The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.
A Monmouth University poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters released Thursday illustrates her problem. Warren earns 13% of the vote overall, good for fourth place, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's 24%, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 20% and former Vice President Joe Biden's 17%. But Warren earns the support of 21% of registered Democrats, trailing only Sanders. Her standing is hurt because just 5% of independents plan to back her. (Other polls in New Hampshire, including ones by Marist College, WBUR and Suffolk University, find similar gaps.)
I explained to her that across America, college enrollment rates have been gradually declining after peaking in 2011. Last year alone, enrollment dropped 1.4 percent. This, coupled with a continued decline in state expenditures, has resulted in many colleges and universities scrambling to fill seats. International students not only provide a positive cultural impact, but provide a compelling economic benefit to the campuses and communities in which they reside.

Harris declared at a CNN town hall in Iowa on Monday that she supported a Medicare-for-all system that included get[ting] rid of private health insurance. But by Tuesday, under fire from Republicans, Harris' staff was clarifying that while Medicare for all was her preferred policy, she was open to multiple paths to universal coverage.
Warren has had a hard time finding her footing in the race. She had an epic rise in early fall of 2019, when her brand as the woman with the plans made her look like a favorite for the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then her support fled to other candidates, such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar. And her third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, stifled any momentum she had in earlier months of campaigning.
The pair wants the co-op to be known as more than just a shop to purchase beauty supplies. They hope the Brown Beauty Co-Op will also be a safe space for all women of color and a hub that provides mentorship for emerging black entrepreneurs and businesses.
On this night, the people inside The Caged Bird are choosing from the specially crafted menu at the venue for DMV Black Restaurant Week, the first of its kind celebrating the best black restaurants in the nation's capital.
Let's not forget that the reason many airlines are so short on cash right now is that they have spent billions on stock buybacks ― money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their customers and workers, Schumer said in a floor speech on Wednesday. That issue should be addressed.
People got mad at me, they said, 'Hannity, you were talking about, well, rich people won't buy boats.' No, rich people won't go to restaurants, because they won't have the money, he claimed without evidence. Rich people won't invest in companies, that means they're not going to hire people.

Then there is the assistance on cost-sharing. It is available only to consumers who buy silver policies and whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line ― about $30,000 for an an individual and $61,000 for a family of four this year. It gets very little attention because even most of the people who get the money don't realize it. (The exchanges factor in the assistance automatically, so that policies simply appear to have lower deductibles and co-payments.) But for the millions who get it, it's the difference between insurance that works and insurance that doesn't.
Other obligations are dodged. Airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes. (In New York, longer-term tenants must be approved and are assessed at least 25% more in condo fees for wear and tear to the building caused by their rentals. Insurance and mortgages are more expensive for rental units too.)

Without once saying the word charter, Booker affirmed, We shouldn't have one-size-fits-all education. Local leaders should be able to decide what works best for them.
In ordinary times, PRI has proven to be an indispensable tool for many businesses that operate internationally in order to maintain growth and profitability. But this is no ordinary time; The winds of change are about to hit us like a hurricane. As the global trade and investment climate deteriorates, and becomes more unpredictable, demand for PRI should soar. The ability to manage cross-border risk through PRI -- and other insurance products -- will ultimately make the difference between those businesses that find a way to thrive in this era of disruption, or merely survive.
We appreciate the support shown by the Federal Government and the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and are grateful for the strong endorsements among the majority of communities along the route and 43 Indigenous communities, as well as customers, contractors and unions, Kinder Morgan Canada's CEO Steve Kean said in a release.
The upshot of this struggle is a consent order under which DC Water must dig enormous caverns - right under downtown DC - to trap the stormwater before it can get to, and overwhelm, their sewage treatment plant. Over the last few years, DC Water has been looking at green infrastructure to see if it offers a cost-effective and more environmentally friendly alternative. Green infrastructure is basically vegetation that absorbs rain. Think of rain gardens instead of cement patios. Think green roofs instead of tiles or sheeting.
The girls were used to getting what they wanted. At Renaissance, Robert was an eccentric among eccentrics. The firm is legendary for shunning people with Wall Street or even conventional finance backgrounds, instead favoring scientists and original thinkers. Robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. Rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals.
It's simple: America is safer when everyone qualified to serve can do so openly and with pride, Biden said in an Oval Office ceremony.
In 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called Breitbart. I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge.
HuffPost reached out to Schlossberg and to Suazo, the man who posted the video, neither of whom immediately responded.
At least one was working for the Trump campaign this month. Megan Powers was listed as one of two operations managers for the Jan. 6 event, and her LinkedIn profile says she was the Trump campaign's director of operations into January 2021. She did not respond to a message seeking comment.
We are investigating this situation and will hold any bad actors accountable, she wrote.
One former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump's first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. They got it through while he had both houses of Congress, the former official said.

Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) haven't gone that far, at least not yet. The draft legislation that leaked last week still had refundable credits, and looked a lot like the plan that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price had proposed when he was in Congress last year. The Better Way proposal, a set of reform principles that Ryan released over the summer, also had refundable credits. President Donald Trump also endorsed tax credits during his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, although he didn't specify what kind.
A day later in Fort McMurray, Alta., Trudeau promoted his government's efforts to get pipelines built and reiterated that the Kinder Morgan project would go forward.
The Republican approach would be a lot more straightforward, and it would likely mean a lot less federal spending. But it would also mean many fewer people buying insurance, much weaker coverage for those who have it, or both.
He then said: I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise.
Previous presidents on extended trips away from the White House typically stayed in the city of each day's final event, or traveled to the city of the following day's first event. Trump, instead, traveled back to Las Vegas each night from California, Arizona and Colorado to overnight at his Trump International Hotel ― requiring several extra hours' flying time on Air Force One, a plane that costs taxpayers about a quarter-million dollars per hour in the air.
But in seeking to reassure voters about his commitment to protecting Social Security, Biden is mischaracterizing Sanders' tactics.
What did the investment world think of this Environmental Impact Bond? What did the market think about Quantified Ventures' proven Pay for Success type of bond? Well, the venerable bible of the municipal bond industry, The Bond Buyer, named the issue the 2016 Non Traditional Deal Of The Year!
Millions of workers struggling to make a living by working on minimum wages are turning the country into something akin to a modern day slavery. There are 62% of citizens that have less than $1,000 in savings and are one paycheck away from the street; the American dream has come to an end; the progression of inequality is rapidly eroding America's middle-class into impoverished masses. It may not be long before the rise of discontent will give rise to social unrest potentially causing destabilization of the very foundation upon which the American society was conceived and built. A recent Gallup survey showing 47% of Americans would vote for a President who was a socialist. This should be seen as a wake up call.
Researchers at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked exclusively at the premium tax credits and how they'd affect different groups of people. The results were predictably complex, with lots of variation from person to person, but the general pattern was clear. Lower income and older people and those who live in high-premium communities tend to get less help, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser, told the Huffington Post. Those who are higher income and younger and live in low-premium areas tend to do better.
When Narcissa Quito, a neighbor of Booker's from across the street, noticed the news conference, she opened up her window, waved and called out to him frantically.
After the Capitol violence, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center urged Trump to call off his visit.
Here are five takeaways from Wednesday's debate:
Republican political strategist and campaign consultant Ed Rollins dismissively referred to 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the little girl with a big mouth.
Warren arrived in the Granite State in a steady position after a third-place finish in Iowa, receiving neither the boost granted to Sanders and Buttigieg nor the preemptive postmortems delivered to Biden. Polling in New Hampshire generally places her fourth, but she remains in third in national polling and in position to pick up a significant share of delegates on Super Tuesday on March 3.
Keane later added, People have been writing about the demise of the Second Amendment for a long time. Politics ebbs and flows.
The AP reviewed social media posts, voter registrations, court files and other public records for more than 120 people either facing criminal charges related to the Jan. 6 unrest or who, going maskless during the pandemic, were later identified through photographs and videos taken during the melee.
Starting in the social media space can be daunting when you don't know what you are doing, but you can easily tackle it when keeping a few key things in mind.
Because the Census Bureau's first contact is usually through the mail, scammers will try and beat them to the punch and send out faux census documents to unsuspecting recipients.
The news comes a day after President Donald Trump said at a Fox News town hall meeting that he's also looking to cut so-called entitlement programs for Americans that include Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.
I am a constitutional officer of the state of Florida, but I can't pull any strings to help them — nor should I be able to, Hardy said. But these people can buy themselves a place at the front of the line.
Dr. Bernhard Schwartländer, China's WHO representative, said there needs to be more smoke-free policies across the country.
But if you take that time you will build a following of lifetime customers, which really should be the end goal.
Works as: Government Attorney Annual Salary: $100K-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50, including coffee made at home as well as Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts on-the-go purchases. Monthly Retirement Deposit: $620. This does not include payments made towards Social Security (that's about $500).
Judging by the extraordinary appreciating values of some urban centers such as San Francisco, LA, San Diego, Denver, Miami and Atlanta, foreign nationals that are able to (in many cases illegally) smuggle monies out of their own countries, mostly from China, Russia, Malaysia and others, are now out-bidding Americans with ease, driving real estate prices to higher levels than the pre-crash prices of 2007. If America does not curtail the foreign buying of American residential real estate, which has tripled since 2005, there may not be another cyclical correction to provide Americans with a chance of purchasing their homes. Charging any non-American citizen duty stamp on the purchase of residential property, is the only way to put a damper to rich foreigners snatching homes away from Americans.
Social media is another place online where census scams can pop up. Earlier this month, for instance, Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran a series of Facebook ads directing users to fill out the Official 2020 Congressional District Census. Those ads did not link to the official census form, however, and instead sent users to a Trump campaign website. People were prompted to submit personal information and donate to the campaign.
First, the Census Bureau will never ask you to provide financial details such as your credit card numbers, Social Security number, bank account numbers, banking passwords or your mother's maiden name.
And state Rep. Erika Connors, who said she was pretty sure she planned to endorse Warren after vacillating between her and Buttigieg, downplayed party unity as an issue.
WASHINGTON ― There's a way for the Trump administration to continue food assistance during the government shutdown ― at least according to one legal theory.
So Ocasio-Cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, Krugman added. Republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.
The Census Bureau does sometimes initiate phone calls to people in order to collect census data, but you can always independently verify that you're talking to a real census rep. You can call the Census Bureau's National Processing Center to confirm the identity of the census agent. If the caller cannot be identified, do not under any circumstances provide the caller with any information Tomaschek said.
Dealers P=1.5C so the formula is (1.5C-C)/1.5C, for a 33% GPM.
Elon Musk spent the last decade building an electric car and solar panel company into a $41.7 billion empire aimed at loosening fossil fuels' grip on the global economy.
Buttigieg and Klobuchar really don't seem to like each other.
Moms for America held a more modest Save the Republic rally on Jan. 5 near the U.S. Capitol, an event that drew about 500 people and cost between $13,000 to $14,000, according to Fletcher.
Ocasio-Cortez has floated the tax hike only on income in excess of $10 million. Hannity earned $36 million last year, according to Forbes.
If wealthy Americans were taxed more ― or, in Hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.
To answer your question, Chipotle, probably not. Aw, rats, right?
Now it has many aspects, most of which I won't go into because its trade aspects alone are sufficient to rule it out as serious policy.
WASHINGTON ― As Congress begins working on a huge fiscal package to prop up the economy and soften the blow for people who are suffering from the coronavirus epidemic and its effects on their livelihoods, Democrats are demanding that any taxpayer bailout to major industries include restrictions on corporate bonuses and stock buybacks.
The rapid-fire reversals highlight Trump's reliance on implementing change on his own rather than building support for his ideas in Congress in order to pass laws.
The Tory leader argued Trudeau did not champion the Trans Mountain pipeline and suggested the federal plan to phase in a price on carbon pollution only makes such projects harder. Scheer noted that Trudeau said the oilsands need to be phased out, remarks for which the prime minister said he misspoke last year.
Buttigieg brought up the subject again later in the debate, focusing on the cost of Medicare for All.
The transition team announced other Justice Department nominees: Lisa Monaco for deputy attorney general, Vanita Gupta for associate attorney general and Kristen Clarke for assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. They said the nominees will be introduced at an event Thursday afternoon.
In response to a question from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) about what economic metric might offer a clue that the government is borrowing too much, Yellen pointed to the amount that the government spends on interest on the debt. As a percentage of the U.S. economy, interest costs have risen much more slowly than the debt itself, reflecting the continued willingness of financial institutions to loan money to the government. Net interest outlays actually declined last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, despite a surge of pandemic borrowing.
President-elect Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion worth of new spending on things like direct payments to households, unemployment benefits and a national program for vaccinating people against COVID-19. The Biden plan would support the economy at a time when employers are shedding jobs and an out-of-control pandemic is still killing more than 3,000 Americans daily.

Our teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America, he said. If you look at this in an economic analysis, they are the professionals who contribute the most to a thriving American economy. And we cannot continue to devalue one of the greatest professions in our country, which is public school teachers.
Right now, 800,000 workers are without a paycheck.
The economic impact on the national level is significant as well. Across the U.S., the more than 1 million international students who studied in the U.S. last year generated over $35 billion for the U.S. economy. This represents a direct inflow of foreign capital to support U.S. universities and state and local economies. Looking at job creation, the numbers are equally compelling – international students were found to support over 400,000 jobs nationally. This equates to three U.S. jobs created or supported for every seven enrolled international students.
A federal approval of a project must be worth more than the paper it's written on,'' Notley said Sunday.

Had Trump held the same events but done so in a geographically logical order ― starting in Beverly Hills and finishing in Colorado Springs, but overnighting each day in the city where he would begin the following morning ― Trump would have spent four fewer hours aboard Air Force One, thereby saving taxpayers about $1.1 million.

Introducing steep taxes on short-term stock market trading and/or outright prohibition on high frequency trading would be a good start, but a serious way to combat inequality is progressive taxation of the super-rich income and their assets, both at home and abroad. Two or three percent increase would bring hundreds of billions of dollars into the public purse, the money that could be used to rebuild or improve municipal infrastructures, create quality jobs, help young Americans get an affordable education, and lower the national debt.
Those steps could be difficult in a country that is also the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, according to WHO. Forty-four percent of the world's cigarettes are smoked in China, and the profits show. In 2015, the smoking industry in China recorded $160 billion in revenue, according to Agence France-Presse.

If Nadella ever does take that seat at a committee witness table, he'd be following the Microsoft tax executive who testified about the company's offshore tax dodging before the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations three years ago. That panel outlined Microsoft's offshore tax dodging maze back in 2012; the recent newspaper report added important details, but the basic structure was already known.
This has become a source of great concern to many global businesses, which are scrambling to stay ahead of the headlines. Some of the things that used to be taken for granted - such as that Europe will always be a source of stability and growth, or that China is an investment destination that must be included in an investment portfolio - simply are no longer the case. Europe's rolling recession -- complete with anemic growth and security concerns - will mean the continent will be a source of instability for many years to come. China's incessant bubble economy, declining long-term growth rates, and increasingly unfriendly policies toward foreign investors have given many companies pause for many years now. There are plenty of other examples of how conventional wisdom has been turned upside down.
The coronavirus pandemic and the recession that's very likely to hit the U.S. economy offer a case study in how this kind of financing scheme puts Americans who earn very little at risk of getting sick or losing a job ― or both ― during a crisis.
Believe it or not, Jason Alexander is now a hoodie for Tide.
In a unique twist, the law also created a program that reinvests 25% of cannabis tax revenue into a fund for youth development, anti-violence programs, re-entry programs, economic development and civil legal aid services for R3 communities ― those dealing with high rates of gun violence, child poverty and incarceration rates.
However, you should be wary of answering the door for anyone you don't know. That person could be a scammer posing as an official census taker.
That same morning, the subcommittee also voted unanimously on SB 1610 to exempt gold and silver coins and bullion from sales taxes.
After a significant year for the gun control movement in 2018, momentum for stricter firearms laws in states across the country likely will accelerate this year.
The subcommittee vote doesn't necessarily mean that the tampon tax bill is dead. The legislators voted to give it a negative rating when it advances to the full committee, while SB 1610 received a positive rating. So in theory, the full 11-member committee could decide to buck the subcommittee members.
This is one of the best prices we've seen on the Bowflex 2. The unique system does away with bulky weights in favor of spring loaded rods for continuous and uniform resistance. No cheating on the weights with this machine. There are no shipping fees and it even includes a free mat valued at $100. If you have the space, the Bowflex is more convenient than going to the gym. Plus you save on a one time cost up front versus a monthly fee.
Bloomberg took a punch. And another punch. And then another one. And another one.
Corporate stock buybacks skyrocketed after Trump signed the 2017 Republican tax cut into law. In fact, over the last five years, 50 of the largest U.S. corporations repurchased a staggering $1.1 trillion of their own stock, according to a Wednesday memo from the advocacy group Economic Liberties Project.
The event also had a distinctly left-wing feel that could contribute to the skepticism some independents feel toward Warren: As Jordan Thompson, a former Harris organizer who later endorsed Castro and was now backing Warren, talked about how any movement for big structural change must be diverse and intersectional, other young people snapped their figures in approval.
It is an open secret that the best political reward is a tax subsidy because it continues indefinitely, is hidden from the public, and never has to be justified once its on the books. That is why the plutocrats have made our tax code so complicated and irrational. As my old boss, Senator Proxmire once said the more complicated a tax provision is, the less justification there is likely to be for it. Everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees that carried interest, for example, should be taxed as ordinary income. Just as everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees it is irrational to encourage the export of jobs and profits by deferring taxes on so-called foreign income. But they remain as part of our tax code because those who benefit from them are willing to spend whatever it takes to defend them while the ordinary citizen, who may know about them, isn't organized enough to mount a campaign against them or those who support them.
Trump's visit — no doubt a symbol of the president's defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of a second impeachment after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week in an effort to halt the peaceful transition of power.

Maggie Mulvaney retweeted several messages on Jan. 6, including one from the president that urged support for the Capitol Police. Trump's Twitter account has been suspended, but the message could be seen in a cache of her Twitter account captured by Google. She also retweeted a message from her uncle, urging Trump to address the nation.

Biden himself shows no sign of changing course. Every signal from the president and his top economists has been consistent and clear since his election victory in November: He will not roll the dice on the country or his presidency with a skimpy bill. On Friday, after the Senate approved an early version of his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the president told a meeting of House Democrats: We can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.

Trump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a big, beautiful wall across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat.

Americans should no longer support overseas economies such as China and others by buying their products that can be made just as inexpensive and more efficient in America. For example, the advent of 3D copier and other robotic technology should be used to entice millions of unemployed Americans to start their own businesses by producing goods now imported from overseas. Days of mega-size ships, loaded with containers up to their chimneys, pulling into American ports should come to an end.

In May, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) introduced the Good Samaritan Menstrual Products Act, which would allow for more menstrual products to be donated to and distributed by nonprofit organizations during the pandemic.
If the president had stayed in three different cities over three different nights that would mean three different advance teams traveling out ahead, three different USSS teams traveling ahead, it would mean impacting traffic with road closures in three different cities, taking rooms for security and communications at three different hotels, and various other necessities for presidential travel in three different cities, said a senior White House official on condition of anonymity. The hotel the president is in is well known to USSS in terms of security and the footprint needed. In short, doing it the way we're doing it saved money for the government and Las Vegas is most central to all the stops. Only a small contingent of required staff with specific roles stay at the hotel with the president. The majority of staff stay at a different hotel. All hotel stays are at the government rate.
Lorrie Belinsky, a retired school administrator and independent, said she was still considering Warren, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). I don't know. That's one thing I maybe worry about. I'm not sure at this point, she said when asked if Warren could unite anti-Trump forces.

The riot at the Capitol, incited by Trump's comments before and during his speech at the Ellipse, has led to a reckoning unprecedented in American history. The president told the crowd to march to the Capitol and that you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After days out of sight following the Capitol siege, President Donald Trump travels to Texas to trumpet one of the pillars of his presidency: his campaign against illegal immigration.
Some unscrupulous owners have rented space out short-term to prostitutes, for orgies and noisy parties. In Toronto, about three years ago, a meth lab blew up in a condo building in Liberty Village due to the activities of someone who shared an apartment.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who recently dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, laid out what she called a progressive litmus test for the bailouts on Tuesday. The eight-point plan calls for companies who receive taxpayer funds to provide a $15 minimum wage, keep people on their payrolls, maintain collective bargaining agreements, and permanently ban stock buybacks, among other steps.
But Sanders was doing just as much of the attacking Wednesday. He came to the debate already a winner of a primary contest and with the momentum behind him.
The alternative argument is that the U.S. is about to lead the world into a wave of destructive economic nationalism that threatens to undermine the core of the post-war global trade and investment regime. In a zero-sum world where my gain must come at your loss, everyone stands to lose, of course. Imposing unilateral tariffs simply results in more of the same. Protectionism implies less competition, higher prices, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. Some of those foreign companies that previously couldn't wait to earn tax breaks by investing in the U.S. and hiring American workers are about to become a thing of the past.
For the average investor, however, it's a dangerous world to get involved in.
These, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. The firm has worked on campaigns in Argentina, Kenya, Ghana, Indonesia and Thailand; the Pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in Iran and Afghanistan. Best of all, from the Mercers' perspective, SCL operated entirely outside the GOP apparatus. (A source close to Rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.)

Robert preferred to focus on his work at Renaissance, often operating from his Long Island mansion, Owl's Nest. He wouldn't look under the hood, because that's not what he does, says Bob Perkins, one of Caddell's associates who worked on the Smith Project. Besides, Rebekah was the political animal in the family. (Her older sister Jenji has practiced law; her younger sister Heather Sue is, like Robert, a competitive poker player). This was a relatively new phenomenon. Rebekah isn't known to have been particularly political earlier in adulthood, while gaining a master's degree in management science and engineering from Stanford, or in early motherhood. (She has four children with her French-born husband, who became an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.)

She wanted to know what I was going to do to hold Wall Street accountable as people were losing their mortgages, she wanted to know how we are going to keep people in their homes, Castro said.

Despite some staples, such as Coke and Budweiser, reportedly taking themselves out of big game advertising this year, CBS says most spots were sold well ahead of the Feb. 7 kickoff. And at around $5.5 million for a 30-second time slot, advertisers aren't horsing around.
One of the few dissents from this new consensus is Larry Summers, the principal economic architect of the Obama stimulus who only a few months ago was among the chorus of economists urging President Joe Biden to go big. But Summers abruptly changed course on Thursday, arguing in The Washington Post that Biden's agenda risked inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, along with consequences for the dollar and financial stability ― in other words, another crash.
So it's a hyper-aggressive subsidy for exports. Boeing can sell a $100 million airplane to Air France, make $20 million in profit, and yet book it as an $80 million tax loss. It's the biggest corporate giveaway I've ever heard of.

Funds must come with strings attached to ensure that the money goes to maintain payroll, not to enrich shareholders or pay executive bonuses, Warren said in an op-ed this week. Giant corporations that receive substantial loans from taxpayers should be required to set aside one or more board seats for a representative elected by the company's workers. Violations should trigger criminal penalties and clawbacks.

This is not a statistic to scoff at. But what do those numbers — and that shocking savings vs. caffeine spending discrepancy — look like on a day-to-day level? We spoke with 13 women* who were willing to share the breakdown of their monthly spending in both categories.

So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?
The insurrection at the Capitol prompted Mick Mulvaney to quit his position as Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland. He told CNBC a day after the assault that remaining in the post would prompt people to say 'Oh yeah, you work for the guy who tried to overtake the government.'
I have strong reservations against them, he said, explaining his concern about regulating guns generally. I don't think there's much support. Even the Democrats in Arkansas are conservative.
That shift played out in the November midterms, when federal and statewide candidates promising gun control won in red and blue states. Lawmakers will carry that momentum into the new legislative session.
It would be about getting public attention, and even more important, causing the government to focus on this problem, he said. And hopefully, to delink the payment of wages to federal workers from the dispute that exists over the border.

The tax credits are also refundable, which means that if your income tax liability is smaller than the value of the credit, or if you have no liability at all, you still get the full value. This is very important in health care because a large number of people buying through exchanges are working in low-paying jobs. They are hotel housekeepers and clerks at big-box stores, home health aides and security guards. If the credits weren't refundable, they wouldn't get much or any assistance, even though they are the ones who need it most.

In states where Democrats made big gains in the November elections, lawmakers are quickly moving legislation to raise the buying age for guns and to ban assault-style weapons. Other measures, including bills to limit gun access for domestic abusers and people who may harm themselves or others, have increasing bipartisan support.

This year, Americans will be asked to participate in the 2020 census, a process that occurs every 10 years. While you should expect to be contacted by the U.S. Census Bureau in the coming weeks (and maybe you already have), it's also a time to watch out for scammers pretending to represent the census.
Among critics of red-flag legislation is Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner. The Republican said that in his state, such a bill has almost zero chance of getting out of committee and zero chance of passing into law.
Under the Affordable Care Act, if you buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, you can get tax credits that help offset the cost of premiums. These are special tax credits, in that they go straight to the insurance companies at the beginning of each month, so you don't have to wait until tax-filing season to get the money.
In the following days, Biden restored collective bargaining power for federal employees and ordered the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to find ways to keep workers across a range of industries safe from COVID-19.
It is not merely the left pushing back against Summers. Mainline party brass Democrats are convinced that the cost of going too small is a broken Democratic Party. On Friday, over 200 former Obama administration officials ― including recently departed Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ― signed a letter saying the undersized 2009 stimulus bill ended up prolonging the economic pain and inhibited our ability to bounce back quickly. They urgee the Biden administration to learn the lessons from the last economic crisis and pass a large stimulus package.

The break for business is in stark contrast to Trump's statement Thursday about cutting social programs for Americans.
In the five short years since then, the risks we wrote about – rising tuition costs, decreased public funding and the financial shortfalls – have all worsened. But we have also seen that strategic and thoughtfully implemented programs that appeal to international students not only improve the educational experience of domestic students, but also provide much needed revenue for universities.
The fact-checking site PolitiFact indeed rated Sirota's claims in his newsletter false, because Sirota omitted some words from Biden's speech to Brookings.

Yet when Kinder Morgan announced the decision to halt non-essential activities on the project Sunday, the company cited B.C.'s continued active opposition and legal challenges to the project.
None of this should be surprising. The architects of the Affordable Care Act were trying to make sure everybody could get decent insurance, regardless of income, and they were willing to adjust financial assistance in order to make that possible. The Republicans who would replace the Affordable Care Act aren't trying to put insurance within everybody's reach. They are simply trying to offer a tax break that would available to people buying health insurance, and even then only under some circumstances.

Various people who have worked with the Mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. Instead, their mission was a systemic one. Steve Hantler, a friend of Rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. Similarly, SCL claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters.
Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package is welcome and robust, but like Obama's Recovery Act, it is not transformative lawmaking. It will enable the country to weather a difficult year, but it will not update the antiquated American economic infrastructure for the 21st century. Biden's payments to families will be welcome and its support for small business is urgently needed. The crises of inequality, climate change, and post-COVID-19 globalization will remain.

So, in 2008, everybody thought that the World Bank's green bonds would have a lower rate of interest than its traditional bonds. The bank would then pass the lower payments on to its developing country borrowers, who, in turn, would be more likely to do more environmentally beneficial projects. Socially Responsible Investors would be willing to accept a lower rate of interest in return for the satisfaction of knowing that their money was creating environmental benefits. What a neat system!

Another major question facing Biden and his attorney general is the fate of the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys across the country, most of whom are Trump appointees. Those officials, who serve as the nation's top federal prosecutors in federal districts, have sometimes been allowed to stick around until their replacements are confirmed. Trump's decision to ask the presidentially appointed holdover U.S. attorneys to resign set off some controversy in March 2017, not long before Comey's firing.
Now the rule of thumb in environmental finance is that the lower the payments, the more projects will get done. Is a farmer going to build a fence to keep his cattle from fouling a stream? If it costs $500, probably yes. If it costs $5,000, maybe. If it costs $50,000, definitely not. Are you going to put solar panels on your roof? If the payment is $20 a month, probably. If its $200 a month, maybe. If its $2,000 a month, definitely not.
President-elect Joe Biden named Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general, the transition team said Thursday.

I think it is more accurate to refer to the problem — and the solution — as one of 'menstrual equity,' she said. That means ensuring that menstruation — and the inability to access products, information, education — does not deprive a person of their dignity or ability to participate fully and fairly in daily life.

Sanders got to take the first swing at Bloomberg: He went after Bloomberg's record on police policy when he was New York mayor.

In markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies.

Times of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.

ahead of confederation, the area now covered by saskatchewan and alberta was proposed by the then-northwest territories premier as a possible large province called buffalo.
forget an arc ― my story became more linear than ever as i jacked up my quest to get white people to see and accept me as white.
last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a michigan courtroom to describe how larry nassar altered their lives with his abuse. they were heard and heeded. the judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. and their abuse, it seems, counts for little.
surely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said jesse bragg, the media director at the boston-based anti-corruption group corporate accountability. experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.
the power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from constantinides in a little over five weeks. in november, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. that would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the green new deal for new york city.

the historical victims of lynching should not, as i do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.
the raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as republicans in november were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives.
while politicians and policy-makers have made mouth noises about the amount of time spent on the big standardized test and the prep therefor, those elements only scratch the surface of how test-and-punish policy has messed with american schools.
other provinces are deploying similar measures.
some twitter users warned that rudell's decision to include screenshots of alleged conversations he had with hathloul could pose a risk to the jailed activist.
this is the new normal in the sense that we live in a globalized world where people are travelling and carrying pathogens and bacteria with them, which do not carry passports. so we just need to be prepared.

during their campaigns, neither warnock nor ossoff endorsed the green new deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a world war ii-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. but both georgia democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and warnock, a baptist reverend, draws on a long history of black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.
that's nonsense, said ali. if you study infectious disease and their origins, they all have their origins in an animal reservoir. he said given the increasing rate of globalization, disease can come from livestock here as well.
meanwhile, environmental groups hope the president's executive order is just the start of aggressive government action to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
the decision that i made, as the longest-serving independent in the history of the united states congress, i said, 'if we are going to win this race, we have to do it within the democratic primary process,' sanders said in a 2016 interview with nbc's chuck todd. he decided to not run as an independent because he didn't want to be a spoiler in the presidential race.

there are approximately 14,900 nuclear weapons ready to fire or in stockpiles. 13,800 are deployed by the usa and russia, while the remaining 1,100 are deployed by china, the uk, france, india, pakistan and israel. north korea may have a handful of weapons. based a range of published or leaked nuclear war plans and statements by political leaders, there are two key types of nuclear war to consider.
federal workers were poised to receive a 2.1 percent pay increase in january, along with an annual locality pay increase.
first, as with most industries, there's automation, which has reduced the number of jobs available in the energy sector over the last several years. when oil prices crashed in 2014, the houston area shed some 86,000 oil and gas jobs and by 2019 had regained only 24,400 of those jobs. why? in large part because in the wake of the crash, oil companies became more efficient and began to embrace automation in a big way.
biden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the american rescue plan, on thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. on average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. nearly 1.2 million americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the department of labor.
on the other hand, xi jinping's close allies are being promoted to key positions. it can be clearly seen from the recent reshuffle. what's most eye-catching is the position of mayor shanghai. ying yong, a former close subordinate of xi jinping, is expected to step up from deputy role to replace yang xiong, who is considered a member of the shanghai faction.
but actually, bishop and medlock believe the changing energy landscape is not such a big problem for the sorts of white-collar workers profiled by the times, whose skills are largely transferable to any segment of the energy sector. in fact, according to bishop, it's a boon to clean energy startups like his to be able to hire oil and gas workers.
the consensus from economists from everywhere from the fed to the imf to other top institutions is that at this very precarious moment in the crisis, the senior biden official said. the risk of doing too little at this moment is far greater than the risk of doing too much and therefore. the investments in this package will actually deliver real relief, prevent scarring, prevent human suffering and actually put us on a path to a stronger recovery, and a stronger and more stable fiscal position.
when mccaul finished, she stepped back from the podium, emotional but resolute, and stared down nassar.
when news of the novel coronavirus first started spreading, asian-canadians like ye felt they were grappling not just with the outbreak of a new mysterious virus, but also the onslaught of racism they've come to expect.
both abeka and bju press have ties to christian colleges. abeka was launched in the 1970s by arlin and beka horton, who also founded pensacola christian college, a florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. bju press is affiliated with the evangelical bob jones university in greenville, south carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.
i find it really interesting how many people are still willing to put money and medals and institutional reputation ahead of survivors ― even under intense public scrutiny, mccaul said.

besides the economic hit, asian communities in canada faced racism at personal levels. the ontario government's post-sars commission found cases of chinese workers getting terminated from their jobs and chinese tenants unlawfully kicked out by landlords. funeral homes cancelled victims' funerals if they heard the body came from a hospital dealing with sars.

antony blinken, biden's choice for secretary of state, said on tuesday the united states would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact.
the whole time, i was surrounded by a lot of white people. a lot. however, i take far less issue with that ― i made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than i do with my attitude along the way. i was in full-on racial denial. i didn't even join any affinity groups for black, indigenous and other people of color or try to make any friends who looked like me.
the interior department did not immediately respond to huffpost's question about whether oil and gas operations have been identified as mission critical services. but in an email statement, an agency spokesperson said that the health and safety of the public and our employees is our highest priority.
yeezy busta, a youtube influencer with 448,000 subscribers who asked not to use his real name for privacy reasons, confirmed to huffpost that perk from mystery brand offered him a sponsorship deal for tens of thousands of dollars in july. after doing some research into the website and deciding it was a scam, he turned it down.

these textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said kathleen wellman, a southern methodist university history professor who is working on a book about the two christian publishers. i'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.
if parents received tax credits in advance ― as house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and ways and means chair richard neal (d-mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.
hoffman said there's no need to panic. however, health agencies must be ready, which is why investing in public health even between outbreaks is so vital.
in choosing to create a three-way race, sanders is dividing the left and making more likely the defeat of an incumbent liberal woman governor by a more conservative republican, in these times wrote. (at the time, kunin was one of only two female governors in the country.)

the 19-page outline sprawls from taxes to health care to workplace safety, and it's not clear which of its policies will remain top priorities when negotiations begin in earnest. some items, such as unemployment benefits, are already on the coming capitol hill agenda this year.
leading up to bushroot, i had spent nearly two decades as a girl who was half-black but hellbent on being seen as fully white. from as early as i can remember, i harbored the belief that in white america, there was a minimum threshold that a human had to meet before the rest of society even considered whether that person could be cute, beautiful, sexy, professional and successful. and that threshold was ... whiteness. the way i saw it (and the way the world had made me see it), if you didn't look white, well then you better hope to be super talented at something that white america valued.
intense city-wide fires loft extensive high-altitude smoke clouds similar to a large volcanic eruption. these clouds block sunlight causing cooling. the latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional india-pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. a 1,800 us - russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°c, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°c. this is greater than the average cooling of 5°c experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.
but it's not unwarranted. ye is feeling the impact of it on his day-to-day life.
it's common for victims of a crime to be given the opportunity to read a statement. but this was different. ingham county circuit court judge rosemarie aquilina took a unique and at times controversial approach, allowing every single person to speak ― which meant that instead of lasting a day or two, the hearing ran an entire week.
the offices of both rempel garner and richards did not respond to huffpost's request for comment.
historic wildfires in california, buttressed by back-to-back united nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. then democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the house of representatives, with nancy pelosi, not yet the next house speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. in response, the sunrise movement staged sit-in protests in pelosi's office demanding democrats instead champion a green new deal.
while emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.
bernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during zinke's tenure, as mother jones highlighted in an october profile. those efforts include a plan to dismantle obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the endangered species act, one of america's bedrock conservation laws. the proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.
at the beginning, the democrats were very angry with him, jane sanders, sanders' wife, said in an interview with huffpost. burlington's board of aldermen — a part-time, 13-seat city council — resisted sanders' efforts. they wouldn't let him appoint any of the mayoral appointments. they stopped him from hiring the city attorney, city clerk, city treasure ... [the democrats] were outright enemies in the beginning.

five states ― connecticut, delaware, massachusetts, minnesota and rhode island ― and a number of cities ― including new york, baltimore and oakland, california ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the u.s. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.
with the likelihood that this will happen again, social and psychological factors of outbreaks should be considered as important as the technical issues — but they're not, ali said.

mcdonald's goes on trial at the national labor relations board in new york city on monday. the proceedings will set out to answer two fundamental questions: should mcdonald's be considered an employer alongside the franchisees who run its stores, and if so, did the company violate its employees' rights amid the mass protests?
i think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in china, anyone is susceptible to the virus.
the incoming administration also wants to pass a slew of changes to low-income tax credits that democrats have sought in recent years, including an increase in refunds for parents from the child tax credit and a boost to the earned income tax credit for childless adults. but biden has apparently not embraced proposals to make the credits payable in advance, meaning the changes wouldn't benefit anyone until 2022, and would only boost refunds for one tax year.

however, scholars who study religion in america say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. christian nationalists argue that the united states was founded as a christian nation and has a special covenant with god, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with god. the textbooks parrot these ideas, said andrew whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the association of religion data archives at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis.
the much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. as well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.
bernhardt represented interior at wednesday's cabinet meeting at the white house, sitting directly next to trump.
if the health and the well-being of the people that you hurt is at the forefront of your mind, i think that that will create an environment and create a mindset for actual progress, she said.
china has put at least 12 cities under lockdown, attempting to restrict the movements of around 35 million people. hoffman said a quarantine on that scale is unprecedented and is unlikely to work, either in china or hypothetically in canada.
much of biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. it includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs.
pakistan eyes this hallmark development as a step towards reinforcing the policy of credible minimum deterrence, the military's media wing said in a statement.
many traditional banks charge a maintenance, or service, fee on checking accounts -- about $10 to $12 per month.
how do you reflect on that contrast?
there's new hope of passing covid-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, k-12 schools and universities. biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. there's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year.
it isn't often that a franchisor like mcdonald's is held accountable for labor law violations at its stores. roughly 90 percent of mcdonald's locations are technically run by franchisees -- the much smaller companies or individuals who tend to the day-to-day operations and ultimately sign workers' paychecks. according to mcdonald's, it's the franchisee who's responsible for the working conditions inside a mcdonald's store.

the only conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that any use of nuclear weapons would be a global disaster and cause unacceptable suffering. nuclear weapons do not keep us safe but under a constant threat of disaster. we now know we have avoided this only by sheer luck in several nuclear close-calls. in 2017, this understanding led 122 countries at the united nations, to support a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in the same fashion as chemical and biological weapons and to press the nuclear-armed states to negotiate major reductions in weapons. we need to get rid of nuclear weapons before they get rid of us.

there's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. but the impact could be huge. of the 24 power plants in new york city, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. the other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.

but the incident ― on which constantinides is scheduled to hold a feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.
huffpost confirmed that youtube's algorithm has promoted mystery brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both google and the content creators. as the hosts of marco and alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: we were nothing before mystery brand. we were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first mystery brand video, they said. through mystery brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing youtube for a living. they now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.

other climate groups have taken different approaches.
despite president obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. groups such as black lives matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. mixed messages from the obama administration, the department of justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.

the interior department is also moving forward with fossil fuel lease sales, as the bureau of ocean energy management offered up a sweeping 78 million acres in the gulf of mexico for bidders on wednesday despite environmental groups' calls to halt the sales during the pandemic. john filostrat, a spokesman for the bureau, said the event was live-streamed with only a handful of boem workers, with bids submitted either by mail or in person at the bureau's new orleans office.
but what is this document and how seriously should you take it?
separatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. opponents of equalization say alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.
the document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how canada works. many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal conservative party before pushing trudeau on them.
gabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the u.s. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. it's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of iraq. (why have politicians of both parties gotten americans trapped in these far-away places?)
mystery brand is not much different from those projects, except for the fact that we make the whole process of buying and receiving items from a mystery box fast and transparent in real time, said perk. he added: sometimes, shipping may take up to a couple of weeks since we mostly use the [online marketplace] stockx platform for purchasing and delivering prizes.
she added: if pay freezes are wrong for those at the top, then surely they are wrong for those on the front lines, and we urge the president to make sure that everybody gets an adjustment so they can keep up with the cost of living.

so i feel proud. i hope that women, particularly those who were never really organizers and started becoming active in the last four years, i hope that they see the fruits of their labor. i hope that black and brown organizers who have been organizing for decades see the fruits of their labor. that's what i'm excited about.

biden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from venezuela, guatemala and hong kong, among others. the house passed a bill to do that last month, but republicans in the senate blocked it. the president-elect has also pledged to work with congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.
many critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using buffalo in its name.

here is an example. three years ago, the borrower purchased a house for $200,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $190,000 at 4%, and a monthly mortgage insurance premium of $65. she expects to be in the house another 4 years. the house is now worth $225,000, requiring an investment of $11,098 to bring the loan balance down to $168,750, which is 75% of $225,000. the return on investment in dollars is the $65 a month insurance premium for 68 months, plus the $14,280 difference in the loan balance in month 84 when the owner expects to sell the house. the rate of return is 8.96%
the fight for $15, which is funded by the service employees international union, has challenged that entire premise. it argues that mcdonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs. the franchise model, it says, merely helps the company shirk its duties to workers, by shifting legal liabilities onto franchisees when workers get shorted on pay or fired for union activism.

bushroot was a squat, gnome-like creature that one of the bros had sketched out at the beginning of the semester to be our dorm mascot. it had bulging eyes and a dark shaded face ringed by short spiky hair. the guys proudly hung photocopies of the bushroot sketch up on all their walls. they would approach the sketch and ask, bushroot, should i take another hit from this bong? or someone in the room would suddenly whisper 'shroot and then they'd all repeat the name in turn, escalating the volume until they were shouting. they would invite the girls, myself included, to chant bushroot along with them and then they would hoot and holler when we did.
johnson takes the reins at ice less than a week before president-elect joe biden's inauguration. he has worked at homeland security and one of its predecessor agencies, the immigration and naturalization service, for more than 25 years, including senior positions in ice's enforcement and removal operations division.
many people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. but the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. one way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.

unity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done, said biden, who has often insisted he will find common ground with republicans despite skepticism from other democrats.
the only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the senate adopted and can easily end. reforming the filibuster is something biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several democratic senators have said they would oppose that.

while the trump administration, industry groups and other project supporters touted the pipeline's potential to create thousands of new jobs, environmentalists and native american groups have long warned about its potential climate and other environmental impacts. the pipeline has already suffered a number of failures, including a nearly 400,000-gallon spill in north dakota in october 2019.
a number of measures now have a chance of passing the senate, including the national origin-based antidiscrimination for nonimmigrants act (or no ban act), which passed the house last july. it would immediately terminate trump's travel ban on several muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban.
but there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. democratic leaders included this proposal in their covid-19 relief demands late last year.

white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said friday that the administration was aware of the issue and was exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.
canadian officials were among those who expressed concern this week after several media outlets reported on biden's looming action. jason kenney, the premier of the province of alberta, said in a statement that repealing the project permit would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important canada-us relationship, and undermine us national security by making the united states more dependent on opec oil imports in the future.

support for having trudeau acknowledge alberta as a distinct culture is likely vastly different than rewriting the constitution to give alberta more seats in parliament.
on the four-year anniversary of that first protest, huffpost spoke to linda sarsour, an original organizer and co-chair of the women's march. (she is no longer affiliated with the group. sarsour and two other original co-chairs stepped down from their positions at the organization in 2019 after reported in-fighting and accusations of anti-semitism.)
at issue is a requirement under president barack obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. the trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.

house democrats also plan to pass the for the people act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. the bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. other bills like the protect our democracy act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as donald trump did, will also get a senate hearing now.

state agencies are already making a push. last june, new york's department of public service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. in december, the state's public service commission released a plan requiring utilities such as conedison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. the new york state energy research and development authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.
the goal of the tour is to invite tens of thousands of young people into the movement, stephen o'hanlon, a spokesman for sunrise movement, said by phone. we want to go where they are, and one thing we've learned … is young people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a green new deal could mean for their communities.
if fannie mae or freddie mac own the mortgage, the cancellation rules apply to the current appraised value of the property rather than the value at the time the loan was made. borrowers can request cancellation after two years if the loan balance is no more than 75% of current appraised value, and after 5 years if it is no more than 80%. the ratios are lower if there is a second mortgage, if the property is held for investment rather than occupancy, if the property is other than single-family, or if the borrower has had recent delinquencies.
after people called the website out on twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. angry reviews on reddit and mystery brand's facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. critics, including controversial swedish youtube influencer pewdiepie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: in their promotional posts, paul and le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their mystery brand videos. le quickly won an $11,000 chanel purse which, according to odds listed on mysterybrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.
for its part, the u.s. olympic committee, the very organization tasked with righting the ship post-nassar, has not been able to land on its feet. the organization announced in november that it planned to decertify usa gymnastics, but usag filed for bankruptcy ― a last-ditch effort to stabilize the flailing organization ― before the decertification could take place. as of this writing, usa gymnastics is still up and running.

according to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. they encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and god, reads the abeka american history textbook. however, many conservatives and christians within america have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn america into a united, moral nation.

the war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the united nations reported in december. airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the yemen data project, an independent monitoring group. the strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting state department lawyers to worry that american involvement could implicate u.s. officials in war crimes.
paul and le respectively pulled in around 2 million and 2.6 million views on their promotional mystery brand youtube videos in one week. content creators can earn an estimated rate of up to $5 per 1,000 views on the platform from ads. after coming under fire, paul addressed the controversy in a pair of snarky tweets last week before reminding children not to gamble. le filmed a subsequent video acknowledging he was somewhat in the wrong for doing business with mystery brand, lamenting other youtubers had done the same in the past without major scrutiny, and complaining the ordeal had been blown out of proportion. neither paul nor le responded to huffpost's requests for comment.
the old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in, he said in an interview published tuesday.
by 2015, when he launched his bid for the democratic presidential nomination, sanders had fully changed his mind about the ability for progressive politics to flourish within the party.
in response to backlash it received for staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, liberty counsel released a statement thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the onenewsnow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the justice for victims of lynching act would limit the law's application.
del duca says he would start implementing the plan within 100 days of winning office. three of its measures — funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, rebates for electric vehicles and discounts for public transit — would be introduced no later than the government's spring budget in 2023.
every shred of admiration i had for you is gone, mccaul told nassar, the doctor she said she'd once respected and called a friend. the man i thought i knew did not exist, only a selfish predator whose atrocities know no bounds.

there are huge implications and consequences surrounding proposed policy changes and lease sales, phil francis, the coalition's chair, said in a statement. these actions should be given full and deliberate consideration, not rushed through at a time when we should be focused on the health and safety of the american people.
images from the capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old mel garman, who grew up attending evangelical christian schools.
frederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming biden administration. among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing oakland's case against five oil giants, including shell, to move forward in the california courts were vice president-elect kamala harris; biden's secretary of state pick, antony blinken; his future climate diplomat, john kerry; his choice for climate czar, gina mccarthy; and xavier becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.
even with republicans out of legislative power, biden faces a potential crisis in the supreme court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the aca's constitutionality. the republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. biden and a democratic congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the aca and rendering the lawsuit moot.
in fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though i had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and i've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). one tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. so districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school k-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.
protecting the aca is but a preliminary step. biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like healthcare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their medicaid programs under the aca. and he has called for lowering the medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a democratic majority makes possible.
paddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the route 91 harvest festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at mandalay bay on oct. 1. he then killed himself. he had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons. it's not clear what his motive was.
lawmakers like sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), sen. patty murray (d-wash.) and rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.

biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.
after news of zinke's resignation, the liberal environmental group western values project launched a website detailing bernhardt's work with special interests. in an accompanying statement, the nonprofit's executive director, chris saeger, called bernhardt the ultimate dc swamp creature.
representatives from bju press and abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. however, a 2017 huffpost investigation found that about one-third of christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called accelerated christian education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. the number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)

since the cold war, both the us and russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. this nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. but this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.

a series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the sunrise movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. the group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the democratic hopefuls to take a position on the green new deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. it's also preparing to stage protests at as many democratic debates as possible ahead of the democratic national convention in july 2020.
in the u.s., gambling is generally defined as paying to place a bet or wager to win a lottery or other prize, and is restricted for minors. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit has ruled that internet gambling on a game of chance is not prohibited by law, however the justice department maintains that all internet gambling by parties in the u.s. is illegal. within the european union, there is no broad policy on gambling regulation, so each member state enforces its own laws.

that sort of response, you didn't get it in the 2003 outbreak, said ali. the racism responses were more interpersonal and individualized — shunning on the street, hate messages on telephone answering machines, canadian-chinese community centres facing verbal abuse.
we must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases, trump wrote in a letter to house and senate leaders.
many americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that obama was inaugurated. unfortunately, americans' views of race relations declined after obama came into office. race riots in places such as ferguson, missouri, and baltimore, maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. president obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.

an even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. this means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. in addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.
sanders' relationship with the party has notably softened since that first presidential run. he served on the senate democrats' leadership team and his 2016 campaign managed to push the democratic national committee to change rules around superdelegates, lessening the power of party insiders in the nominating process.
the school immediately drew criticism for the harsh policy — not only does it have the potential to leave students dehydrated, but it also punishes them for needing a drink. parents raised the alarm about the sign and made it clear that the policy was unreasonable. you're not going to fail my kid because he's thirsty and he wants a drink, one concerned parent said to a local news channel. if my kid's playing in the gym room and he's hot and sweaty and he asks for a drink and he goes to get a drink, are they going to deduct a point from him? asked another. a mother put it simply, i thought it was not right that they were depriving the children of having water.
canada should start considering how to properly deal with the social impacts of outbreaks, ali said, especially given that with globalization, they're more likely.
we have been preparing with the provinces and territories since we heard about the first cases in china. we began implementing new measures to mitigate the risk of introduction of the virus into canada and to control and prevent its spread, said maryse durette, the agency's senior media relations advisor.
the sierra club's beyond coal campaign empowered local communities across the country to organize around shutting down coal-fired power plants, but it's limited in scope. the organization's broader 100 percent renewable energy effort struggled until the emergence of the green new deal rhetoric to address concerns over the impact on jobs.
the senate confirmed bernhardt as interior's deputy secretary in july 2017. before his confirmation hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, citing his ties to the industries he is now charged with regulating and labeling him a walking conflict of interest.

the analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of christian educational materials ― abeka and bju press ― looked at how the books teach the trump era of politics. we found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative christian policies. language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.

indeed, the sale came the same day the price of oil plummeted to its lowest level in 18 years, with west texas intermediate, the primary u.s. benchmark for crude, falling to $22.90 per barrel on wednesday, a 15% plunge and the cheapest price since 2002. brent crude, the global gauge for oil prices, dropped 9% to $26.16 per barrel. at those prices, it's nearly impossible for many u.s. fracking companies, responsible for the majority of the country's oil production, according to the energy information administration, to pay back steep debts, prompting the trump administration to consider measures to bail out drillers.
william becker served for nearly two decades as a senior official at the u.s. department of energy, specializing in energy efficiency and renewable energy. in 2007 he left doe to create the presidential climate action project, which convenes national thought leaders to develop recommendations on federal policies to promote clean energy and to combat global climate change. bill began his career in journalism, beginning at age 19 as a combat correspondent for the u.s. army in the vietnam war. he has been a reporter with the associated press and the publisher of his own weekly newspaper in rural wisconsin, where he proposed and helped implement the relocation of flood-prone village to higher ground and its reconstruction as the nation's first solar-heated community. the village is nationally recognized as a pioneer of nonstructural flood prevention. since then, he has assembled teams of experts to help disaster-affected cities rebuild as more sustainable and resilient communities, ranging from the lower ninth ward of new orleans after hurricane katrina to the reconstruction of homes in thailand for victims of the christmas tsunami. bill has had an eclectic career including stints as the research director for the republican caucus in the wisconsin state senate; executive assistant to wisconsin's attorney general; and counselor to the administrator of the u.s. small business administration. he has authored several books and major policy studies. he lectures nationally and internationally on sustainable development, clean energy and how to address global warming.
plains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to indigenous communities.
loujain didn't know anyone in la, so she was tagging along with fahad for the day. they were young, cool, cosmopolitan, and incredibly nice. i liked them right away. we chatted. — kirk rudell (@krudell) january 2, 2019
we support premier jason kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's fair deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the canada pension plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads. but we must go further. much further.
democratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.
but former vermont gov. peter shumlin, a democrat who has endorsed former vice president joe biden in the 2020 nominating contest, said he was skeptical that sanders could keep the party together during an election against trump.
johnson has been attacked for being slow to take action to stop the spread of the illness, such as shutting down large gatherings to head off widespread contagion.
an additional 18 members of the 116th congress responded don't know or didn't list a religious faith on the latest questionnaire.
huffpost spoke with almost all of the women we talked to for last year's article, plus a few additional survivors: mccaul, klein, thomashow, larissa boyce, christine harrison and jessica smith. a year later, now that the public is finally listening, i wanted to know ― have msu and usag righted their wrongs?
it took welcoming these two beautiful boys into the world for me to realize the journey i had been on was not the journey i wanted to stay on. i do not know what would've happened if i had not become a mother to them ― if the realization that i was hiding from who i really am had not accompanied them when they appeared in my world. but it did. and it made me rethink ― and re-feel ― everything.
huffman appears to have responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith on the faith on the hill survey. but his office said the data was outdated, and confirmed that huffman identifies as a nonreligious humanist. raskin, meanwhile, is among the 34 members of congress who identify as jewish.

under another provision of this law, lenders must terminate insurance at the borrower's request when the loan balance hits 80% of the original value. borrowers can accelerate the process of getting to 80% by making extra payments.
after bearing the brunt of the social and economic impact of sars in 2003, chinese-canadians were left to rebuild their lives by themselves. the asian canadian labour alliance noted in their post-sars report that though the government had put aside $150 million to help ontario recover from sars, not a single cent went to chinatown businesses or workers.
survivors of the bombs dropped over japan at the end of world war 2 speak of a bright sunlit day plunged into darkness as black oily rain fell. dead figures, charred black still standing. burned and terminally injured survivors, their skin hanging off; eyes and other internal organs hanging out of their bodies. cars and vehicles tossed like toys, strong structures reduced to piles of rubble. huge fires.
the textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes black lives matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. the book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the obama administration were.
the country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when iran-backed rebels known as houthis ejected yemen's internationally recognized government from sanaa. six months later, saudi arabia and its allies, notably the united arab emirates, launched a military intervention against the houthis ― with crucial backing from the u.s. and other western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.
if you regularly have to deposit cash or like to visit a branch, try brick-and-mortar credit unions, which usually have lower fees and higher interest rates than big banks. credit union membership may be restricted to residents of certain geographical areas or workers at qualified employers, but you may be able to join by making a donation of $5 to $10. that's generally less than one month's service fee at a big bank, so it's worth the investment.
in a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. in pennsylvania, ap test results can count toward a school's ranking. many states are now moving toward using sat's as the bs test for high school ranking. consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (will the ap credit be any use to her at her chosen school? does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. this spring, somewhere in america, a high school principal is going to say, i don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at pat's school in pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. you get pat in there to take that damn ap test, whether pat wants to or not.
as the democrats take control of the house, i'd like my fantastic @repadamschiff to have fahad and loujain in his thoughts.
but the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond america's shores. like sanders and warren, gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. what she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.

plunging prices and mergers aren't the only things that could cost big oil companies in the near term. almost immediately after wednesday's auction took place, the legal challenges began. earthjustice filed a lawsuit wednesday on behalf of several environmental groups asking a federal judge to block the gulf of mexico lease sale on the grounds that it violated the law by failing to fully analyze the risks new drilling posed to the public. brettny hardy, an attorney for earthjustice, called it the latest example of the administration putting profits before the health and safety of people and the planet.
president-elect biden has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic, sanders said in the statement.
the campaign for trauma-informed policy and practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.
roughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the house on thursday. but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) vowed to block the bill, and trump said he would veto it.

by the time the midterm elections began, the sunrise movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. the group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and michigan gubernatorial hopeful abdul el-sayed. the sunrise movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like new york gov. andrew cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.
on jan. 25, health officials confirmed a man in his 50s who had travelled from wuhan to toronto had contracted the virus — the first reported case in canada. officials said the man was in stable condition in a negative pressure room at a toronto hospital. a second case in toronto — the first patient's wife — as well as a case in b.c. have now also been identified.

thomashow said that for msu to improve, the school needs to listen to the team of experts and advocates it has on hand as part of the recently created relationship violence and sexual misconduct expert advisory workgroup. the group consists of rock star advocates, thomashow said, including andrea munford, the lead msu special victims unit detective who broke open the nassar case in 2016.
the automation trend has continued, medlock said. so when production grew again from 2017 to 2019, that growth didn't require a lot of additional labor input.
over the course of my life i can see how what i was taught in christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on jan. 6 played into it. that whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said garman, who is now a social worker. it's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.
the humanitarian situation in yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, scott paul of oxfam america told huffpost in december after a slim senate majority approved the u.a.e. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in yemen. congress and the biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in yemen.
but the messages i was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. as i got old enough to make my own decisions, i chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. i made no efforts to diversify my social circle. ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.

may said immediately after the vote she would embark on a round of cross-party talks to find a way out of the brexit deadlock amid suggestions from cabinet ministers that she could be edging towards a softer withdrawal from the eu.
during roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.
intuitively, it would appear that the sooner you pay down the balance and rid yourself of the pmi premium, the better off you will be, but this may or may not be the case. it depends on the circumstances and preferences of the borrower.
the canadian home builders' association (chba) is also growing more vocal. in early march, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. the housing supply deficit - not enough homes for families with young children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. the report notes that if current trends continue, canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade.
when discussing protests against the iraq war and president george w. bush's low approval rating at the time, the abeka 11th-grade u.s. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in america was the media, supported by a large number of hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.
you don't get 2 million people together without having some radicals in the crowd or some simple people in the crowd that you could lead anywhere, right? he said, also greatly exaggerating the size of the crowd that day.
but analysts told huffpost last week to expect a wave of bankruptcies of smaller producers that could lead to consolidation within the industry as oil majors, the companies that almost exclusively had the capital to bid in wednesday's auction, buy up troubled rivals.
del duca couldn't project how many emissions his plan would cut, but said he'd align himself with the federal liberals' goal to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. and he hasn't worked out how much the plan would cost.

as with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. another important answer to get on paper: what counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. if you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as gemsafe.

as one of the top contenders going into the iowa caucuses in early february, sanders now clearly believes that he can bring about a progressive revolution within the democratic party — one that he's worked to change.
other potential names reportedly under consideration for solicitor general include sherrilyn ifill, director of the naacp legal and educational defense fund; david cole, national legal director of the american civil liberties union; and barbara underwood, new york state's solicitor general.
the sanders/warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the u.s. and in rivals like russia and china. in that view, challenging the status quo of american foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as gabbard did with brutal syrian dictator bashar assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-american regimes like assad's or u.s. partners like saudi arabia.

the questionnaire identified only one representative ― sen. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz.) ― who says she is religiously unaffiliated. sinema, who has taken issue with the atheist label in the past, has been the only openly unaffiliated member of congress since she was elected to the u.s. house in 2012. (she's also the first openly bisexual member of the u.s. senate).
the law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement sunday. today's court ruling stops another attempt by the trump administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. it's 2019, yet the trump administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.

at the time it made me feel excluded and made me feel invalid in who i was.
and it connects seamlessly to another trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly muslims. gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from iraq and syria to enter the u.s., courted indian prime minister narendra modi, despite his links to anti-muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a fox news darling for her willingness to claim president barack obama was making americans less safe by supporting arab rebels in syria and not using the phrase radical islam. (obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; gabbard and trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the islamic state.)
in alberta, we have proactively issued a province-wide advisory to doctors to ensure physicians are aware of the virus, are able to take recommended actions and promptly alert public health officials if they encounter a suspected case, tom mcmillan, a representative for alberta health, told huffpost canada.
scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the u.s. capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism. before storming the capitol, some groups prayed in the name of jesus and asked for divine protection. they flew christian and jesus 2020 flags and pointed to trump's presidency as the will of god. the linkage between christian beliefs and the violent attack on congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with trump and their support for the rioters.
the federal government feared this would concentrate too much power in one province and grow to rival quebec and ontario, the authors argue, though there is little historic evidence proving this.
in 2003, toronto was hit especially hard by sars. there were a total of 44 deaths, all in or around the city. as the toll rose, people started staying away from chinese restaurants and grocery stores, cbc news reported in 2003. businesses in toronto's chinatown reported their customers dropping by 70 to 90 per cent.

donald trump has a long history of shortchanging workers, mccollum said in a comment to huffpost. while the government is shut down and federal employees are going without pay, he's doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. i find this outrageous. the president must rescind this action, or congress must work to prohibit it.
for federal employees, this can be an unsettling time with many unknowns that include probable policy changes and new personalities calling the shots. but it also can be an opportunity for career executives to lay the groundwork for productive working relationships with the new team.
at the start of his career in politics, sanders viewed the democratic party as hopeless. by 1985, he had already made several failed bids for elected office in vermont as a member of the progressive liberty union party. he finally succeeded in 1981, becoming mayor of burlington, the state's largest city, and toppling a five-term democratic mayor.
nearly one-quarter of u.s. adults now consider themselves to be religiously unaffiliated, compared to just 0.2 percent of congress, or 1 in 535 members, according to pew. meanwhile, more than 88 percent of congress identifies as christian ― including all but two republicans, both of whom are jewish ― compared to just 71 percent of the u.s. public. overall, the 116th congress is slightly more religiously diverse than the prior congress, according to pew.

the citizens' climate lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.
today, we expect the incoming u.s. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years, he said.
by parroting such conservative political views under the guise of christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. while all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

but a large share of new york city's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of queens that constantinides represents. the plants, located in the councilman's native astoria and neighboring long island city, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. the stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of no. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. the long island city plant, called ravenswood generating station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.
it's hard to imagine a better moment for democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. the coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of covid-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.
trump transformed the supreme court with three new justices, the most named by any president since ronald reagan. progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal stephen breyer, the oldest supreme court justice at 82, to retire as soon as biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late justice ruth bader ginsburg. if breyer does step down, biden is expected to nominate the first black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.
i can teach people power, but i can't teach people the process, procedures and mindset for these big energy projects, he said. just in texas alone, we're putting over $100 million of capital to work and we need a level of rigor around project management, safety and process that oil and gas companies are really good at.
guitar center has been wrapped up in a nasty labor dispute with the retail, wholesale and department store union, which provided the arbitration documents to huffpost. in 2013, rwdsu won elections at three guitar center stores, including las vegas, but the union is still without a contract at any of them. the general counsel of the national labor relations board accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, leading to a recent two-week trial. a decision hasn't yet been issued.
here are some answers to your buffalo declaration questions.
consider the example given earlier where after three years the borrower earns 8.55% on an investment of $11,098. if the same borrower decided to make the investment after 4 years instead of 3, her dollar savings would be smaller because both the number of pmi premium payments and the balance reduction in the payoff month would be smaller. on the other hand, the required investment would be $7326 instead of $11,098, which might make it affordable, and the rate of return on investment would be 10.52% as compared to 8.55%.
every time a politician talks about climate policy or a newspaper runs a big story on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the question of jobs comes up. for those who are opposed to the transition, the common criticism is that moving away from coal, oil and gas would leave hundreds of thousands of americans out of work. for those in favor, the question is how to train hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers for different sorts of jobs.
since reports of larry nassar's misconduct to michigan state faculty began in 1997, two years before i was even born, i can't help but wonder, mccaul continued. how many little girls could have been spared from this lifelong battle if someone at the university had just done the bare minimum and listened?

you could get a pile of shit or you could get a rolls-royce, 21-year-old paul, youtube's second-highest-paid star, told his 17.7 million subscribers in a recent video sponsored by mystery brand. i want you guys to go to mysterybrand.net right now and play this game and tell me or tweet me or something if you guys win this, ok? urged paul, who said in 2018 that his youtube audience is primarily comprised of 8- to 16-year-old kids.
one year ago, almost to the day, morgan mccaul stood in a tiny courtroom in lansing, michigan, ready to face down her abuser, former usa gymnastics and michigan state university trainer larry nassar. with her pixie-cut hair and tortoiseshell glasses, the diminutive 18-year-old university of michigan student didn't look especially formidable.
mysterybrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium california real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of paul and le's viral videos. its now-deleted photo of a $250 million most expensive los angeles realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million bel air home, the daily beast and others reported. and until recently, mystery brand's prize list included a 2018 lamborghini centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). the same goes for its real car rolls-royce phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.
rarely do the talking points — or the debates that follow — get into the details of what's actually happening in the oil and gas labor market: that it's an industry already grappling with a dwindling talent pipeline and that a push toward automation was making tens of thousands of oil workers redundant even before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out more jobs.
youtube stars have made big money directly through mystery brand sponsorship deals. daniel keemstar keem, a youtuber with 4.7 million subscribers, claimed he declined a $100,000 offer from a similar company to promote its service on his channel. le, who has 10.8 million subscribers, suggested mystery brand paid him well above that amount for his sponsored video.

iran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to trump's maximum pressure policy by gradually breaching the accord. tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if u.s. sanctions are removed.
the plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by wyden and many democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the september cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.
on the campaign trail in 2019, joe biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. we should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a february debate. and on his campaign website, biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.

i feel proud. the women's march was a warning to the country that we were going to mobilize in large numbers to hold this administration accountable. we reached women across the country, including a majority of women who never ever marched or organized a day in their lives, and we were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. a white woman won't be free if black women and muslim women and refugee women are not free. it was a very powerful message.

stefani reynolds via getty images david frederick would run the office that represents the united states before the supreme court if he became joe biden's solicitor general.
biden has promised he will end the obama-era policy and treat saudi arabia as a pariah. but he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that trump crafted for the u.a.e. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional democrats opposes.
that said, democrats do have a lot of political considerations to take into account. many biden officials remember the political failures of the 2009 economic relief package, the american recovery and reinvestment act, a policy that economists maintain was economically sound, but republicans made so politically toxic that democrats lost control of the house just a year later.
at various times in ed history we have talked about teacher-centered schools, community-centered schools and student-centered schools. what we have seen over the past decade is the rise of the test-centered school.
the proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. the proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid.
also in the rescue proposal: a call to hire 100,000 public health workers, both to combat the pandemic and create jobs, as well as funding for schools to test and prepare classrooms for a return to in-person learning.
how do you think the women who marched in 2017 can channel that energy into four years of a biden presidency? a president they likely see far more common ground with, but still need to demand big change from.
passages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which america is constantly moving away from a moral center, with christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.
one passage in an 11th-grade u.s. history textbook from abeka states, although many false philosophies were popular in america before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism.

but the senator's view of the party — and the role of progressive politics within it — has evolved. he's since refined his critiques to focus on the corporate wing of the democratic party, which is composed of the same centrists, including organizations like third way, that pushed the party to the right during the 1980s and '90s.
ali says outbreaks are going to keep on happening, just because of the way we live.
meanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. the fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. so even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.
these six words shattered the little world that i created for myself during my freshman year at syracuse university. up until that point, i had considered myself to be pretty much nailing the whole college thing as i adjusted to life eight hours away from my maryland childhood home. i was getting good grades, keeping my homesickness mostly in check, convincing myself that i enjoyed cheap beer and making new friends. cool new friends. cool new bro friends, to be exact.
foreign nationals from all 26 countries of the schengen area, which make up most of europe, will be barred from entering the u.s. for at least 30 days as protection against the spread of coronavirus, trump announced wednesday. the united kingdom and ireland are not part of that group, but they do have cases of coronavirus — and trump golf resorts.

in 2015, usda and epa announced the first-ever u.s. food waste reduction goal—a bold and aggressive goal of halving our food waste by 2030. if the federal government doesn't invest in food waste reduction, then we will fail to hit the mark. it is time for congress to tackle the issue of food waste in the u.s.; a farm bill that remains silent on the topic is a missed opportunity to break our food waste habit and achieve significant social, environmental, and economic benefits in return.

the affordable care act ― biden's famous b.f.d. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of americans, it needs work. biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer medicare for all system. a fully democratic congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.

other provinces are dealing with their own economic- and market-specific challenges and opportunities.

in march and april, the sunrise movement will host events in florida, california, pennsylvania, new york, kentucky, michigan and elsewhere. the tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.
so here i am, in all of my vulnerable glory. i am sharing the bushroot story to belatedly call out racism and cruelty but also to illustrate just how powerful white favoritism and, let's be honest, white supremacy can be in this society. by hiding the pain that i felt at syracuse and, more generally, by focusing so much time and energy throughout my life into trying to convince others and myself that i am just as white as they are, i have undoubtedly caused pain to myself and to those who look like me. i don't want to do that anymore. especially not to my son.
the biden plan also calls for the federal government to launch community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination clinics to hard-to-reach areas, although the transition team has not specified whether the federal government will be creating and running those centers directly or whether it will simply be providing support to state and local governments, many of which have already launched some efforts along those lines.

that hasn't been enough for many of his critics, who accuse him of only half-heartedly campaigning for former secretary of state hillary clinton in 2016 after dragging out the primary, and question whether he would be willing to support down-ballot democratic candidates who don't share his progressive ideology.
as we learn and move forward, the university continues to engage and invest in an intense reform and cultural change effort to ensure michigan state university is a safe campus for students, faculty, staff and our community, she said. msu has made many strides in addressing sexual misconduct situations, including implementing a new chaperone policy and strengthening mandatory reporting policies for all staff.

while those responses were unwarranted and irresponsible, ali says that the anonymity of the web means those responses can happen faster than ever.
plus, the trump administration is stacked at every level with officials who reject the very reality that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, making it hard to envision green new deal legislation passing until 2021 at the earliest.
with some members of congress likely identifying as religious only to avoid the potential negative repercussions of saying they don't believe in god, the nonbeliever community must show that it will have the back of any politician who publicly embraces the atheist mantle, said speckhardt.

bernie fights when he has to fight, jane sanders said. bernie's interest is getting things he wants done, done. he found that he had to fight effectively against the democratic party at the beginning as mayor. but over time, by organizing, he learned he can change the democratic party.
and that ultimately is the problem with test-centered schools; the relationship between the school and the student is turned upside down. instead of asking, how does this help us meet the educational needs of our students, the school asks, how will this affect our test scores? in a test-centered school, the school is not there to serve the students -- the students are there to meet the needs of the school. and no -- there isn't a scintilla of evidence that test prep serves student needs, nor that test results are an important indicator of their education.
what is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. we've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. i believe that the women's march ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the women's march ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. we cannot defeat donald trump or his policies in silos. once donald trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. so i think in the next four years, under the biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.
i first addressed my hair, which seemed like an obvious place to start at the time. i felt grateful that at this point in my life, i was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. i began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream. i figured it was the price i had to pay to scorch out any traces of bushroot.

that amounts to roughly half the previous lease sale, which took place last august, and marked the first time since region-wide sales began in 2017 that total bidding failed to surpass $100 million. it's a sign that oil prices are too low for anyone but industry behemoths to make offers, said an analyst for energy consultancy wood mackenzie.

note that the $65 monthly saving in mortgage insurance extends for only 68 months because in month 69, the ratio of loan balance to original property value falls below 78%, which under the law requires the lender to cancel the policy.
what sanders and warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of u.s. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not americans' problem. they're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with clinton and many republicans — the idea that u.s.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. they have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like russia for the sake of american global standing. instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of u.s. citizens as well as people abroad.
at first, while i was still hurting inside, i felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as i could from the position of being a victim of racism. i would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, suck it, syracuse! as i became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. i am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka type a), so i began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were. i began to go long stretches of time without thinking about syracuse or bushroot or any of that pain. in fact, i never told a soul about bushroot until this year.
but kong said the damage was already done.
during the partial government shutdown that started in december 2018 and became the longest in u.s. history, the fossil fuel-friendly trump administration plowed ahead with its energy dominance agenda. as about 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, the interior department worked to boost oil and gas development in the alaskan arctic, processed fossil fuel drilling applications and permits, and even brought back dozens of furloughed employees to ensure offshore drilling activities continued.

congressional democrats also want to reverse some of trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that republicans included in the tax cuts and jobs act. among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.

as a women's march leader, i remember during the [brett] kavanaugh hearing i was the first protester in that senate chamber, and all i did was get up and say, this is a travesty of justice. this is a mockery of justice. that's all i did. and i was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the capitol police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. i did not engage in violence. i did not have any weapons. i was an unarmed woman just saying that i was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and i was brutalized by the capitol police.
in a marked change of tone, however, similar to that exhibited by trump, johnson said thursday that the virus threatens the worst health crisis in a generation and that many more people will die. but he wasn't quite prepared to stop major sporting events.

huffpost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize nelson mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive south africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. many of the schools that use these books also ban lgbtq students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. at one point in an abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.

we have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the dignity for incarcerated women act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. introduced last summer by senators cory booker (d-n.j.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and co-sponsored by sens. kamala harris (d-calif.) and dick durbin (d-ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.

congress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. the upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. industry groups are already on board—the food marketing institute and grocery manufacturers association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.

in ontario's greater golden horseshoe (the gta, hamilton-burlington, oakville-milton, guelph, kitchener-waterloo, cambridge, brantford, the niagara region, barrie and nearby cottage country), the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly tight. this is expected to lead to continued double-digit price growth, resulting in further erosion in affordability and sales activity in the absence of a significant and sustained rise in new supply, crea says.
against this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. in ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the ontario home builders' association, ontario real estate association, and the building industry and land development association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. and to speed up the approvals process.
the left realists are present in a lot of places and are able to be spoilers quite effectively, hurlburt said. though their numbers are vanishingly small, they're loud and articulate, and they have a critique that can be very resonant when you look at some of the disasters going on around us.
the bottom line is that bernhardt is too conflicted to even be acting secretary, saeger said.
there are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. for example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. for other programs, directing usda to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.
unlike the '80s, oil companies these days are competing for workers with more stable and more popular industries, including clean energy.
but passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the sunrise movement faces considerable challenges. labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. the sunrise movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential green new deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to e&e news. in a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.

mccaul, like thomashow, stressed the importance of prioritizing and centering survivors in nassar's wake.
the idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (aros) are fulfilled. consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the u.s. in need of remediation.
the province needs to cut emissions from non-electricity sectors to meet future targets, according to a report by the environmental commissioner of ontario, an independent office that was cut by ford's government.
a high-school-level textbook from bju press also blames the black lives matter movement for racial discord. it says:
the sunrise movement is working with electoral groups such as justice democrats and climate hawks vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a green new deal. early polling already shows the group could make a difference. democratic voters in new york's 4th congressional district, a densely populated swath of suburban long island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.) if she voted against a green new deal, according to survey data released last week.
bishop said he's not worried that the people he's hired away from oil and gas will defect back to fossil fuels if prices hit $100 a barrel again.
on domestic matters, gabbard is in line with her counterparts: she supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. yet on foreign policy, she's gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every democrat (and republicans like president donald trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by american empire.

international aid organisations and health bodies all agree that the tens of thousands of casualties from just one nuclear bomb would overwhelm all attempts to help the injured. as a result, there would be no hope of treatment for severe injuries including burns, broken bones, deep cuts from flying debris.
so, for me, when i watched insurrectionists and white supremacists storm the capitol ― people who had announced days in advance that they were coming to the capitol ― and to see that they were treated with kid gloves really shows you everything we were trying to expose in the last four years under this administration. law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. and i've experienced that. i've been arrested over 20 times on capitol hill grounds, inside the capitol and outside the capitol. so to watch people just walk right in, break windows, steal mail from federal government officials ― it was a very triggering but eye-opening experience for the rest of the country.

i think this time around it's made so much worse by social media, where anyone can say anything they want, whether it's trying to take advantage of it for views and making these fake claims, or it's people like this who are spreading a racist message.

this is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. the bureau of labor statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. and while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.

women said this would happen, noted rachel o'leary carmona, the executive director of the women's march. this is exactly who we knew trump to be. this is exactly who we said he was. and this is exactly why we got him out of office. because this attempted coup is just the beginning of what he could have done if he got another four years.

if my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on tv, here's where i ― the black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. i would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that i wanted so badly to be white in the first place. post-bushroot, i would have taken a hard look at all the other times i had experienced both covert and overt racism. i would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which i was the butt at syracuse. i would have sought solace from other people of color ― maybe even my own family members ― who might have understood and helped me deal with my pain.

i think that nationally, the party has on issue after issue sold out so many times that if you go before the people and say, 'hey, i'm a democrat,' you don't usually generate a lot of enthusiasm, sanders said in 1991 about the idea of a progressive trying to work within the party.

half a dozen survivors described a feeling of hopelessness before the sentencing, telling huffpost last year that it seemed as if the country simply did not care about the abuse they experienced. some attributed it to sexism. others believed the lack of public attention was because most of nassar's victims were not olympic gymnasts.

the sign went public on tuesday, and as of wednesday, carson elementary has already removed it. the school district is calling the policy a misunderstanding. it released a statement apologizing and clarifying the issue: there was a sign posted at carson elementary intended to remind students when it is appropriate to ask to leave class for a water fountain break. the sign's directive was outside school policy, a result of a misunderstanding about the school's procedures. when school officials learned about this, the sign was removed. students are permitted to ask for permission to leave class for needed restroom or water breaks at no risk to their grades. the school district has since confirmed that students' grades will not be affected.

a vaccine could take years of research and testing to develop. mers, for example, which emerged in 2012 and has already killed 851 people, still doesn't have an approved inoculation. sars, which was identified in 2002 and killed 774, mostly ran its course on its own by the end of 2003. most people with various forms of coronavirus recover on their own, but older people and those with chronic disease are more likely to be hit with severe forms of the illness.

contrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.
realistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. it has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.

conventional wisdom tells us to drink eight eight-ounce of water per day. according to the mayo clinic, the directive is easy to remember, and it's a reasonable goal. some people may need less than eight glasses per day. as they say, most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. that extends to students — and means way more than one trip a week to the water fountain.

in the test-centered school, there are remediation courses, but these are not remedial courses in the classic sense of trying to help students who are behind in their comprehension of content. these are test prep courses, in which students' time and attention is devoted to practicing the skills of test-taking. perhaps the school uses a program package so that students can work independently on computers, drilling multiple choice responses to test-style questions, over and over and over and over and over, day after day after day after day after mind-numbing day, until the students have been taught that english and/or math (because these remedial courses are never required in non-tested departments) are miserable disciplines filled with nothing but drudgery and boredom.

jail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. the remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. in 2016, the vera institute of justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.

another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from republicans, making it less likely. how much action biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what biden proposed as a candidate.
paramount among these is the john lewis voting rights act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. the proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the vra in compliance with the supreme court's 2014 decision in shelby county v. holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. that decision freed state-level republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. former president barack obama called on the senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for lewis.

the 2018 farm bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. in massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure. the farm bill could provide dedicated planning and implementation funding to support state governments that implement similar bans, making the wins seen in massachusetts replicable across the nation.

according to beijing sources familiar with the chinese government information on wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the ccp leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. they are the communist youth league faction and the shanghai faction. they deserved to be the main powers since the youth league faction produced former president hu jintao and premier li keqiang, and the shanghai faction produced former president jiang zemin. their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. but now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. it's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. chinese vice chair li yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of hu jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.

liz vladeck, a lawyer with cary kane llp who represents the union, said she questions the legality of guitar center requiring its employees to sign such a document. although federal courts have ruled different ways on the issue, the nlrb has declared that such mandatory agreements illegally infringe on a worker's right to protected concerted activity with colleagues.
these remediation courses will have two other side effects. first, they will fill up the student's schedule, so that students who have not done well enough on the test must take remediation 101 instead of shop or art or band or accounting. these will be the students whose strengths are not english and math, but they will not be able to fully pursue their strengths, but must instead spend their school day focusing on their weakness, their area of failure. if you have never spent your days being bad at something, you may not understand just how corrosive to the spirit it is.
as president, trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in scotland and ireland, which have struggled financially. he took an entourage to doonbeg after a state visit with queen elizabeth ii last year. vice president mike pence went three hours out of his way to stay at trump's resort in doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in dublin. the u.s. air force spent nearly $200,000 at trump's turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.

the legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. that would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the new york waterfront. those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.

the pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. two of the biggest cases against rival exxon mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in new york and massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.
the legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft huffpost obtained. by dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.

if international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? she said, adding that money repeatedly took precedence over girls' lives.
what shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said jeff hauser, director of the center for economic and policy research's revolving door project. frederick is selling to shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.

spring has sprung, and while spring season is normally an occasion to celebrate, with days growing longer, weather getting warmer and real estate heading into busy season, everything feels a little different this year.
at a time when 800,000 federal employees aren't getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the vice president and its political appointees, lowey said in a comment to huffpost.
the raises could cost $300 million in taxpayer money over the course of 10 years, the senior executives association told the post.
sanders never won full control of city government, but he organized enough voters to elect some allies onto the board and win veto power. he soon became popular enough to win reelection by a 20-point margin.
in one of the most glaring missteps, usag appointed mary lee tracy to the prestigious role of elite development coordinator, only to learn that she'd defended nassar in december 2016, when more than 50 women had already accused him of serial sexual abuse. days later, she resigned.

a democratic majority in the senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. the federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. with democrats holding the house, the senate and the white house, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.

check your bank's policy for exact terms so that you can set up direct deposit and keep the minimum required balance to avoid maintenance fees. if you can't meet the requirements, look for a bank without these fees.
it was fascinating to see the comparison of the beginning of trump's presidency to the end, the crazy contrast of people registering their reactions to losing an election. one, the women's march, was peaceful and joyous, while the other was a violent insurrection.
[we have] to point out to them that we would much more appreciate their openness about their deeply held convictions, versus hiding them or lying about them, he said. their integrity and their alliance on issues matters to voters much more than whether they happen to believe in god or not.
we do not take this action lightly, the board said in its statement. this is a matter of public safety.

in a youtube video defending the organization, jonathan alexandre, liberty counsel's public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching's horrible history to push unrelated political agendas. he confirmed that liberty counsel is questioning members of congress about the created list of protected categories.
in 2015, astoria and long island city suffered from higher pollution levels than the rest of the borough and the city, according to new york city department of health findings. the levels of pm2.5 ― a fine-grain pollutant that wedges into lung tissue when inhaled, making it one of the most harmful types of particulate matter ― hit 8.9 micrograms per cubic meter, higher than the 8.4 average for queens overall and the 8.6 average citywide.
president donald trump continued that policy and took further steps against the houthis that had devastating consequences for yemenis, such as slashing u.s. aid for houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. when lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher u.s. approach to the saudis over their role in the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi, trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of american aid to the saudi-led coalition.
some small cities have managed to shift to renewable electricity but nothing on the scale of new york, said david pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit energy and policy institute, which tracks the utility sector.
people often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy, says jerry ehrenwald, president and ceo of the international gemological institute. however, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item. every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started.
there were the christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside american flags. the rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of god, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white christian supremacy. last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. she felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.
meanwhile in albany, the new democratic majorities in both houses of the new york legislature are preparing to push the climate and community protection act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. the ccpa has repeatedly passed in the state assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous republican majority in the state senate refused to hold a vote on it. gov. andrew cuomo (d), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.
the pakistani military said the babur-3 missile was capable of delivering various types of payloads and will provide pakistan with a credible second strike capability, augmenting deterrence.
there's not a single reason for persistent attacks on yemenis such as the may 2019 strike that hit his children, elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from hunger ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in yemen, which was directed by oscar and emmy nominee skye fitzgerald. (watch above. note: the video contains graphic images.)
that's a more modest increase than top congressional democrats are currently demanding. sen. ron wyden (d-ore.), who will be the chairman of the senate finance committee once democrats take control of the senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in march, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit.
trump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.
in 2015, president barack obama rejected keystone xl, saying that u.s. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. trump, in turn, revived both keystone xl and the dakota access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. legal challenges followed and in november 2018 a federal judge halted construction on keystone xl and ordered the trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company transcanada to again proceed with construction.
it has an enduring psychological impact, he said.
on its surface, the justice for victims of lynching act isn't about queer rights. the bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. according to the naacp, lynching was used after the civil war to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. at least 4,742 people, predominantly african-americans, were reportedly lynched in america from 1882 to 1968.

most national security experts believe that without american support for the bombing, the saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. that move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own yemeni partners.
your workout routine could be sabotaging you. here are the moves you should do before sleep and the ones to skip.
borrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. when they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. if the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. in that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.
sean lynch, a sales employee at the company's las vegas store, said he and his colleagues were told they must sign the agreement by end of day friday or they forfeit their jobs.
outside of the women's marches, i reflect on the direct action that was led by women over the last four years. i remember in 2018, during the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers, we organized the largest women-led civil disobedience in history. and the capitol police figured out how to arrest over 640 women that day who were engaged in non-violent direct action inside of the senate hart building in the atrium.
it would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, she told mps.
but speckhardt also called into question the accuracy of the latest faith on the hill survey. he noted that rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of god and said he embraces the humanist label, which holds that one can lead meaningful, ethical lives capable of adding to the greater good of humanity without theism or other supernatural beliefs, according to the aha. rep. jamie raskin (d-md.), a member of the aha, has similarly identified as a humanist in the past, though he's distanced himself from the atheist label.
ontario's emissions have been falling since the mid-2000s, largely because the liberals phased out coal plants. wynne, who still sits in the legislature as an mpp, sometimes shouts, you're welcome, when pcs say ontario has cut its emissions.
until then, we were looking to the 2017 federal budget, tabled on march 22 to see what, if anything, ottawa would include to begin tackling some of these challenges. at the very least, it would have been reasonable to expect some modernization of the existing home buyers' plan to allow canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty. many thought such changes would be included in budget 2016, but none were forthcoming.

in other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. in chicago, high school teacher raven althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are black.
commenting on civil rights activist jesse jackson's democratic presidential runs in the 1980s, sanders said he did not agree with jackson's decision to work within the democratic party. (sanders endorsed jackson's candidacy.) his skepticism of the party continued in subsequent decades. in 2011, he said democrats could be called republican-lite for considering cuts to social security and medicare in order to lessen the deficit. and his first presidential campaign in 2016 didn't shy away from blasting the party apparatus.
obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said adam laats, professor of history and education at new york state's binghamton university. there's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.
there's a mass feeling across the public… that trump has walked away from what are perceived as american values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, hurlburt said. she sees sanders and warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.
✅ michelle rempel does not represent me.
amid that cultural backdrop, there have been no open atheists in congress since 2012, when then-rep. pete stark (d-calif.) lost his seat to a challenger. stark had already been in congress for over three decades when he publicly acknowledged his nonbeliever status in 2007. former rep. barney frank (d-mass.) also waited until after he'd retired to announce that he doesn't believe in god. no candidate has ever entered congress as an avowed atheist.
if you organize, the people will elect new people, jane sanders said, citing those like rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), who famously ousted a top-ranking house democrat in the 2018 midterm elections. you will see bernie supporting and raising money for the best of the democrats. you will not see him doing that for others.
it's clear that fame, money and attention is what's motivating them, smith said of usa gymnastics and msu. let's be clear, though, you can't buy us off. there's no amount of money, there's no amount of fame or attention that can get us to stop.
kong thinks that, going forward, it's all about balancing a needed policy-based response and not producing unjustified hyper-fear. even within the community, he said, fears are fluctuating between oh, i'm so scared to this is no big deal.
the plan, as currently designed, would likely need bipartisan support to pass congress. but democrats, who will soon have control of the senate majority, also have a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation available to them, which will allow them to pass certain proposals with only a simple majority.
the first is a global nuclear war involving the us and russia. in this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. this is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.
sen. dayna polehanki has pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session. the livonia democrat said monday before the panel vote that an open carry ban does not go far enough and will lead to a false sense of security for those who work at and visit the capitol.
since the virus has already been genetically sequenced, diagnosing new cases is a fairly quick process. the world health organization is monitoring the situation but has not yet declared a global health emergency because the spread outside of china is still contained.
the executive order on the oil pipeline, which biden signed just hours after his inauguration, is part of an anticipated blitz of early executive actions to reverse trump-era policies. several are expected to target the previous administration's industry-friendly rollbacks of environmental regulations.
at the very least, a democratic senate should allow biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the trump era ― not just legislatively through the congressional review act, but by reshaping the national labor relations board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. the trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is deposed as the senate's leader, biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.

in comparison to other investments, an investment in pmi payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. the drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is. eliminating this uncertainty is the reason we developed the spreadsheet.

the vulnerability of society to nuclear attack
the quiet hope among backers of sanders and warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.
queens officials, including constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern astoria the nickname asthma alley. in 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using no. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and no. 4 oil by 2030. the new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.
last week — a century ago by 2021 standards — social media lit up with various opinions about a new york times story that highlighted the waning fortunes of new college graduates looking to work in the oil and gas industry. some sympathized with young people graduating into a pandemic, but most wondered why they had chosen to work in the industry in the first place, given what we know about both its impact on climate change and its financial prospects in years to come.
climate and a green new deal
while jared kushner's buddy mbs was planning to murder khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including fahad and loujain.
salaries for hundreds of top government executives have been frozen since 2013, when congress enacted a pay freeze amid debate surrounding the fiscal cliff bill.
the legislative push builds on high-profile efforts from other top city hall officials. in december, new york city comptroller scott stringer announced a significant next step in divesting the city's $200 billion pension funds from the oil and gas sector as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city's fossil fuel risks.
fahey's announcement surprised employees. he joined homeland security in march as a senior adviser for immigration policy after years as a federal and state prosecutor in virginia.
the representative did not respond to further requests to elaborate on details of the interactions or what staff may have observed. the spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed.
your bank may charge you an overdraft fee if your withdrawals and transactions total more than the balance in your checking account. most large u.s. banks charge at least $35 per overdraft, according to a recent pew study. if you don't correct the negative balance in a certain amount of time, you could get hit with an extended overdraft fee -- that median is $20, the study said.
the bill, announced tuesday and set to be introduced wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. six cities across the united states already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. the city council in washington, d.c., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. but it would be a historic first for a metropolis like new york to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.
atm fees can be avoided by using your own bank atm. that may require choosing a bank whose atms are easily accessible from your home or workplace, or looking for local bank branches and atms when you are out and about. you could also get cash back when making debit card purchases at many retail locations, eliminating the need for a trip to the atm.
david bernhardt, the interior department's no. 2 official and a former fossil fuel lobbyist, took over wednesday as acting secretary after the resignation of scandal-plagued agency chief ryan zinke.
the industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between march and august 2020, according to the bureau of labor statistics and consulting firm deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said ken medlock, senior director of the center for energy studies at rice university's baker institute for public policy.

liberty counsel has spent years advocating against lgbtq rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative christians over the civil rights of queer americans. the organization represented kim davis, the now-former kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical christian heroine, comparing her at one point to jewish people who were persecuted by the nazis.
there will still be pushback from conservative democrats like sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that congress considered. manchin, sen. krysten sinema (d-ariz.) and sen. angus king (i-maine) voted against a resolution in march 2019 outlining the core tenets of a green new deal. newly elected sen. john hickenlooper (d-colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.

her bid makes sense on its face: democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (she is a military veteran and was the first hindu member of congress.) much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. in 2016, she surrendered a plum democratic national committee post so she could endorse sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and argue top democrats were unfairly helping former secretary of state hillary clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.
even if we did try to stop travel, it still happens anyway. the good news about travel that's done through official channels like flights is that you can track it and if someone does get a case, you can use some contact tracing knowing who that person traveled with and who they were around, he said. generally travel bans don't work and people find ways around them.
it's structurally quite similar to the 2001 firewall letter, written by future-prime minister stephen harper and other prominent albertans to then-premier ralph klein urging him to to fully exercise alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the canada pension plan.

the inauguration of president joe biden is expected to bring a return to the paris climate agreement, immigration reform, economic relief and more. on a less policy and more pawlicy-focused note, biden's swearing-in to the highest office in the land also marks a return of dogs to the white house.
the general counsel's case has put the entire franchise industry on notice. the international franchise association, a trade lobby, has led a publicity blitz against the board, claiming it threatens businesses and entire industries if it deems companies like mcdonald's joint employers. republicans in congress have publicized their cause, holding hearings and pushing legislation that would block the board from moving forward with such cases.
there is real pain overwhelming the real economy, biden said. it's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis.
this has been updated to include comment from mccollum and sanders.

meanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. but it's now possible for congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.

the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since independence from britain in 1947. both nations have been developing missiles of varying ranges since they conducted nuclear tests in may 1998.
arbitration agreements have become highly controversial for the way they hamstring employees and weaken their legal power. by sending disputes to an arbitrator, they force workers to pursue their claims individually and outside of court, preempting any collective action. and even though they're supposed to be neutral third parties, arbitrators are often cozy with the companies that workers are squaring off with, as the new york times detailed in a recent series.

the challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, anthony leiserowitz, the director of the yale program on climate change communication, said of the upcoming sunrise movement tour. one-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, i would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.
engagement ring insurance plans work on an annual basis, and according to investopedia, you'll be paying $1 to $2 for every $100 the ring is worth. the number fluctuates according to where you're based: you'll be expected to pay more for your coverage for places with higher theft rates.
but bushroot had enough similarities to my appearance that i had to believe it. the shaded skin, for one. and the spiky hair. i understood that my afro-style cropped cut was an unconventional look for our white, affluent, sorority-laden upstate new york campus. it was for me, too. i had never done anything so bold when it came to my appearance. i had gotten a burst of confidence after high school, though, and wanted to make a start strong in this new chapter in my life. i wanted to show up to college and really be someone.

modern society is heavily reliant on electricity to power central heating pumps, to provide water, information via tv, the internet and mobile phones. nuclear strike will mean no water supply, no heating or lighting, no information, no mobile phone signal.
a core pillar of biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's covid-19 relief bill offered. biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer.

homeowners should view paying off pmi as a potential investment that can yield a high return. until now, figuring out how large that return was exceeded the capacities of almost all borrowers, but no longer. my colleague allan redstone has developed a pmi payoff spreadsheet, which shows the investment required to eliminate pmi, and the rate of return on that investment, for each of three rules: 80% of original value, 75% of current value after 2 years, and 80% of current value after 5 years. the spreadsheet is on my web site and is available for anyone to download.

days before mccaul and her legion of self-proclaimed sister survivors confronted nassar in court, i published a piece about the 140 women who had publicly accused nassar of sexual abuse at the time. while their stories had commanded attention in the lansing area (thanks to first-rate reporting from local media), they hadn't yet garnered the international attention they would ultimately receive. it was frustrating, and disappointing, to see dozens of stories of serial abuse brushed aside by mainstream media.

determine the type of coverage you actually need: most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. however, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a rider — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you.

like other coronavirus strains, the wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.
under federal law, lenders are required to cancel private mortgage insurance on most home mortgage loans made after july 29, 1999. cancellation will occur automatically when amortization has reduced the loan balance to 78% of the value of the property at the time the loan was made. the borrower cannot accelerate this process with extra payments.
the other side effect will be on what the school can offer. your english and math teachers will have to make room in their schedule for test prep 101, which means that they don't have time to teach any elective courses.
the dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.
so now we dipped into politics.
trump blamed the european union for exporting cases to the u.s., a strategy some critics said was intended to deflect criticism from his administration.
it takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #buffalodeclaration after an animal sacred to first nations, when most of their complaints stem from how canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — jeff rybak🍁 (@jeffrybak) february 21, 2020
founded officially in april 2017, the sunrise movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the occupy wall street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. by the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the sunrise movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), the group finally took form a few months after president donald trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.

after the end of the cold war some 30 years ago, public debate and understanding of the enormous scale of impact of nuclear war fell to very low levels. this has changed with recent nuclear weapons tests and missile firings by north korea. in this article i explain why the threat of nuclear war may now be higher than it has ever been and why we should all be aware of the latest scientific studies of the impacts of nuclear weapons.

initially, the disease wasn't readily transmitted from person to person and all patients had visited the market believed to be the source of the outbreak. but the virus appears to have mutated, giving it the ability to transmit more easily between people and having infected some health-care workers. however, all transmissions are still first and secondary. that means so far, people who got sick either went to the market or were in contact with someone who was at the market, which has been closed for disinfection since jan. 1. no one has gotten it from third or fourth degree transmission, hoffman said.
use of a nuclear weapon today would be much worse for two reasons: a typical modern nuclear weapon is now 8 to 80 times larger; modern society is much more reliant on vulnerable information technology and long distance supply routes for food and fuel.
it was hard to say no to the money, but i felt like in my position it was better for me to save hundreds if not thousands of people from losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars, he said. it really hurts me to see so many kids losing their money. a hundred dollars to me or to other creators isn't a whole lot, but to these kids it might be their savings or their holiday money.
this whipsaw effect is confusing for voters and businesses and sabotages climate action in the long run, says ontario liberal leadership contender steven del duca. that's why he says — if he wins the leadership convention and the next election — his government would collaborate on climate policy with opposition parties.

to add to the multiple impacts, most locations in western europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. you may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.

with preparations for the 2018 farm bill already under way, now is the time to rethink the role the federal government can play in reducing food waste to protect people, preserve our planet, and provide economic benefits, while helping us value food as a resource. this week, the food law and policy clinic of harvard law school, in partnership with food policy action and refed, released opportunities to reduce food waste in the 2018 farm bill, which recommends policies congress can implement to tackle food waste in the next farm bill.
last year the interior department blocked a proposed casino partnership between two connecticut tribes. the project would have been competition for an mgm casino in nearby springfield, massachusetts, and the company lobbied against federal approval. interior's decision is under investigation by the agency's inspector general.
after more than a century of inaction from congress, the senate unanimously approved legislation in december that would make lynching a federal hate crime.
pipeline owner tc energy corp said in a statement wednesday that it would suspend construction ahead of biden's order, which it called very disappointing.
gop lawmakers were largely silent on the plan on thursday night — neither senate republican leader mitch mcconnell nor house minority leader kevin mccarthy released a statement — but the proposal drew praise from the traditionally republican-leaning u.s. chamber of commerce.
this is a breaking news story and will be updated. follow huffpost uk on twitter here, and on facebook here.
biden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. but tehran has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy.
even more distressing to many survivors, msu interim president john engler closed a $10 million healing fund in december originally set aside for counseling and other services for nassar victims. the school redirected that money into an existing $500 million settlement divided between the 332 women who'd sued the school. this move left dozens of other accusers, who were not part of the lawsuit, unable to collect support funding for necessary counseling and other mental health services. (last week, msu's board of trustees voted to establish a new fund, although board chair dianne byrum said the details are still to be worked out.)
astoria, n.y. ― a top new york city councilman is preparing to introduce a bill mandating that the city come up with a plan by the end of the year to phase out nearly two dozen gas-fired power plants and replace them with renewable sources of electricity.
many albertans also noted that the manifesto doesn't reflect their experiences.
jonathan ernst/reuters with the elections of jon ossoff, raphael warnock and joe biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform.
responding, may dismissed his call for a general election saying it would be the worst thing we could do.
he has taken the democratic party's loyalty pledge and repeatedly promised to support whoever becomes the party nominee to defeat president donald trump. but that hasn't been enough for many of his critics in the party's establishment, who are likely to point to the letter as evidence he doesn't play nice with the party.
it's unclear whether an overhaul of new york's power stations would trigger utility cost increases for ratepayers, but industry groups likely to oppose the bill are expected to argue that it would.
the bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a consolidated edison substation next door to the astoria generating station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. the accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.
reducing food waste offers a significant opportunity to impact the economy and environment. we spend $218 billion to produce, process, transport, and then dispose of 62.5 million tons of food each year. wasted food eats up 20% of our nation's freshwater, cropland, and fertilizer before ending up in the landfill, where it adds 113 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere annually. at the same time, one in seven americans are food insecure. much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure american.
richard horton, the editor in chief of the medical journal the lancet, accused johnson of playing roulette with the public by taking his time instituting changes.
he believed that the two-party system was bankrupt, but as he was put in a position by the people of vermont to effect real change, he had to consider, how do you effect real change? jane sanders said. his concern isn't party politics.
but the breakthrough came in november, days after the election.
we should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. xi's long-time speechwriter li shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. the appointment shows that the chinese president is seeking to train li to be secretary wang qishan's successor.
but lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. last month, congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. the federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.
biden and vice president kamala harris have pledged aggressive government action to combat the global climate crisis, and in recent weeks they've assembled what environmentalists have hailed as an all-star team to lead that effort. as promised, biden signed a second executive order wednesday to rejoin the paris climate accord.
our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.
it's vital now to have a clear picture of what president-elect joe biden's choices could mean for yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change u.s. policy.
it was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. i'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason.

as the next few weeks went by, i did my best to bring up my ring times and even tried to memorize some of the produce codes. my co-workers helped, including the young supervisor. but i still found myself hiding when mothers i knew walked by. while i couldn't shut my light off and pretend my lane was closed, i did other things.
below, people who have been in ldrs, presently or in the past, share the surprising perks to their relationships.
debt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, lere said. issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.
try not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said jessica baum, a psychotherapist in palm beach, florida. remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. patience is really important here.
the body image wrestle and win. while the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. i am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. of course i have wrestled with certain things i don't like about my appearance, and things i wish i could change, as we all have. but i have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. i think the wrestle ended before we even got married. what really drove it home was coming to the place where i knew that god created me this way, just how he wanted me to be, no more and no less. he wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. once i accepted this, i was awestruck by the truth of it. thinking of who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. i can honestly say that i don't struggle with my body-image now. of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. but there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say i'm done. we throw out all of the lies. we get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. so we take you're too____. and you're not____enough.

my gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. a four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. i don't feel strongly about it but i figure, every bit of luck helps. i am very attached to a tiny gold chai (meaning long life in hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, scott, brought back from jerusalem. my good luck pieces feed my spirit. they do not bring me luck.
the duchess, 39, is suing associated newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five february 2019 articles in the mail on sunday and on the mailonline website that published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, thomas markle, after her marriage to britain's prince harry in 2018.
this new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.
the above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. i really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. it was very difficult to adapt. i'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but i know marriage plays a role as well. my cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. from age 12, i always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. i do not exaggerate when i say i never missed a period, even during my early twenties when i was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. the thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. well, not really disaster. maybe just extreme stress. several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. not just a few days. late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. what do you think this resulted in? me rushing out for pregnancy tests. oh my gosh, why is it so late? it's never late! i've got to be pregnant! nope, not pregnant. just late. this left me very frustrated. not only did this change occur, i also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables.
the u.n. should not put itself in a position of promoting or suggesting a right to abortion, whether it is humanitarian or development work, u.s. ambassador to the united nations, kelly craft, said in october.

in 2018, gabbard introduced the no more presidential wars act, a resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from congress in order to engage the military against any enemy. she also introduced a resolution that would make a presidential war an impeachable offense.
when i brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. he questioned why i had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. for starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.
gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.
the california law allows judges in divorces with pets to take into consideration:

that's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. it can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. when misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.
faced early in his first term with a threatened u.s. cutoff of funds in the event of israel's ouster, he worked behind the scenes to stop arab efforts to deprive the jewish state of its general assembly seat. there was muted criticism from the arab camp that he had given the americans the right of way in the middle east.
luckily, some work relationships work out great, edmonds said. i met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. you just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. pda or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.

don't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, marzolph said. try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.

money is a complicated beast in the therapy room, and in real life. it is a charged topic that is, for many, taboo, said joy lere, a psychologist with a practice focused on the merger of money and mindset. it is more than simple math … differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.
months have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning. i thank my lucky stars that, despite some serious moments of doubt, they are supporting us. i realize that deviating from the comfort and certainty that astrology has brought them is a process in itself.
she's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.
still, as determined as we were, i will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. this was the first time i would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, i wondered if i was going to jinx my marriage.

however, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to rollo. the way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.

i stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while i listened for the beeps. i didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. i could be friendly or i could be conscientious ― i wasn't capable of both. this, i realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so i'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. i couldn't believe how awful i was at this.

at our last session, i wondered about larry's quiet demeanor. this followed my umpteenth observation that larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. that's worth a lot. when i asked larry what keeps him so polite with beth, he responded, i'm afraid of offending her. she easily gets offended. on a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. he didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. wow!

here is something i was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. i had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who i am as a person, to the point where i now feel more like myself than ever before. i believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. the right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. i found myself moving towards things i'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects i'd always meant to finish. being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. the knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. i grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. i felt no shame in being 100% myself. i believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.

this tradition dates back to the 19th century when prince albert's grandmother gave queen victoria some myrtle ― a symbol of good fortune in love and marriage ― which victoria then planted in her garden at osborne house on the isle of wight. she cut a sprig from that plant when her oldest daughter, princess victoria, got married in 1858. since then, queen elizabeth ii, princess diana and kate have all carried a bouquet with myrtle from victoria's garden. the same bush is still thriving.

and yet sunday's awards were a great microcosm of the interesting place hollywood now finds itself in, five years after #oscarssowhite, three years after #metoo. the host of the night, ricky gervais, made a few pithy attempts at jokes about diversity, calling the hfpa (who vote for the winners) racist, and calling out the lack of female director nominees.
i've spent years making money and saving it. when life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), i feel like i have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. it might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but i think it's the opposite. we've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.
in my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. when you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. so many of the issues i see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: people who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. a few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― ryan howes, a psychologist in pasadena, california

being in a ldr has created a stronger level of communication than i think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. at any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if i traveled out west. this worked really well for me because i worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. on days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.

but there were surprising losses, too. (this excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like ava duvernay's stellar when they see us, lupita nyong'o's performance in us and zendaya coleman's role in euphoria.) eddie murphy's comeback performance in dolemite is my name failed to garner recognition; he lost to taron edgerton for rocketman, and dolemite was shut out altogether. billy porter of pose (unsurprisingly) lost the best actor in a tv series - drama award to industry juggernaut brian cox of the wildly popular succession. and, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite jennifer lopez — dressed in gold — lost the best supporting actress in a motion picture award to laura dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in marriage story.

i often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'it's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' we all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. the wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. it's ok to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― ryan howes

one small example of a benefit: when i'm home sometimes i wear a kerchief on my head that makes me feel like i look like a less than attractive peasant from the old country. so i was happily surprised when during the appreciation part of one of our weekly marriage meetings, my husband complimented me for looking cute wearing the kerchief. this gave me a warm feeling inside and an outward smile. we've been holding these meetings for twenty-seven years. i practice what i preach!

some of you may wonder why i harp so much on donald trump. there are a few reasons, not the least of which is that i detest everything he stands for. it just goes against all i believe in and hold dear. plus, if he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, i believe he will put america -- and very possibly other countries, canada included -- in danger.

the ease of confident self-care. this ties right in with the above. i wish someone would have told me how much the opinions of my husband regarding my appearance would bring me to a place of self-acceptance that i never knew before. this played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but i am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how i look has been lost. i just don't really care anymore. this is not to say that i no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that i am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence i need to care just enough. not too much to where i obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where i become lazy and unkempt. while i love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, i also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since i shaved my legs, or if i wake up and decide not to do my hair. this is one of the best and most beneficial things i've found about marriage so far. and i do know that some husbands can have the opposite affect on their wives, based on how they affirm, or how they cut down.

while i had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, i felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of january. i realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. it's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and i don't just mean financially. people are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. i certainly was caught up in mine.

i was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, i wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. instead, i looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. i'd just have to make the next customer understand: i was not just a cashier. this was not a real job for me. i pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.

i very quickly realized i was being irrational. my relationship with my partner was built on a foundation of mutual understanding, communication and real-life work. it is this same approach that we will rely on as a married couple, with no space for the universe's opinion. for me, love is not a mystical phenomenon ― it is a manifestation of the respect and unconditional care that two people have for each other and that makes them want to spend forever with each other.

when a one-upper brags, they misjudge how the story will play for others. if i tell my co-workers about how i quit my first job at 22 to backpack through europe for a whole year, they'll think it's romantic and cultured sounding! the one-upper thinks.maybe they'll want to join me on my next smaller trip.

it was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. instead, i cried silently as i pushed the metal carts. i slid one into another, creating a chain that i jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. it was mother's day and i'd forgotten to put in for the day off. people rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the day-glo vest i was forced to wear whenever i did cart duty. how the hell did i wind up here, i asked myself as i wiped at the tears i tried to pass off as rain on my face.

once when preparing to leave for yet another field trip my wife came to me in tears. our time together had been dwindling and her heart was breaking. she asked me not to leave. i so very much wanted to go on this particular trip. but i didn't fight or argue. given the option of seeing and studying beautiful rock formations vs loving and caring for my beautiful wife i chose the latter.
i felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so i picked up extra jobs wherever i could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. i tried hard to get ahead of it. still, i wondered if january 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. for a while, it was all i could think about. i wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. personally, i felt like i was constantly underwater.

certain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. if you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. maybe even learn to laugh at it. (i wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, i think the count was four.)

i love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. since we started dating, i have been to australia two more times and my husband has come to america four times before moving here. during those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. in between those visits, we also got to travel together to vietnam and peru together. he proposed at machu picchu, which is something i will never forget. we figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — eames

i am quite certain you have looked at another person and said to yourself, she is so lucky. well maybe she is but so can you be lucky because i think we all get a chance to get lucky in life.
she had no idea how much it meant, though. with this gift, i'd finally be able to get out of the hole i had basically been in for two years since getting separated. i'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. it was maybe the most meaningful gift i'd ever gotten and it came from someone i'd never met or even spoken to before online.

although i'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, i didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. they found solace in knowing that the universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so i chose not to rebel.

this year's globes infamously shut out women in the best director category, despite the abundance of critically acclaimed, money-making films by female directors including lulu wang, lorene scafaria, greta gerwig, mati diop and celine sciamma. their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.

this was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. while i was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, i really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. the instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. the over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all hpts leads one believe that they are trustworthy. imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, i peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. i stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world i was going to tell my husband. would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? how would we pay for all of this? how would i continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? i immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. i waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. the test was negative.

ldrs are not an easy feat. they take work, no matter how serious or mutually casual the relationship. these kinds of relationships make you answer the very nerve-wracking question: what do i want from this and am i willing to do the work to make it happen? this is a terrifying aspect of romance that many millennials and gen z babes avoid in the never-ending quest to try and be 'chill.' ldrs don't really have room for 'chill' and force us to figure out our values and get clear about what we want. ultimately, that can leave you with a relationship (or relationships) that sustain you and benefit you in the long-term. — engle
contrary to popular belief i don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is fucking rocked, he continued, pivoting his speech to address everyone in the room.
how can i possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? i could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if i could leave early to go to the doctor. was i pregnant or not? needless to say, i really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. this entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.

i used to love christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and i'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all i felt was relief. there had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before christmas. i had burst out crying in the first five minutes. in an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, i yelled and raged, and i left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. but mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.
i've heard of many. there was a middle-aged man whom i met at a reading. he said he was shocked after reading my story. he had never thought about it that way and began worrying about his own wife resigning. he said he had a mental breakdown and decided he needed to change before his own wife quit. he said that he had got rid of all the unnecessary things for holiday preparations and went to the movies with his wife after almost 20 years of marriage, which made them both very happy.
when my wife and i got married i knew there would be some things i would be giving up. most men worry about never sleeping with another woman again or not having the freedom to go out with the guys. i'll grant you that the first absolutely applies. the second? not necessarily.

just as i typically do ― or, at least, typical as things have been since i submitted my letter of resignation in 2013. after my letter, i didn't go to my husband's parents' home for two to three years. then, when i did go, there again, i didn't cook ― as i normally would've done ― and we ordered in. but the food wasn't as good as home-cooked meals, so we started cooking one dish at home, and since last year, we've been cooking just enough jeon [korean pancake] for our family to eat.

after trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, i realized it was time to say what i was really thinking. at that moment, i didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. i was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.

i'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. that means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― zach brittle

you may say, that's the same as before, isn't it? but it isn't. the difference is my actions are now voluntary. no matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. it feels demeaning. but it's not unpleasant to do it voluntarily in a balanced relationship. now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.

black hair defined is all about letting people tell their stories about their hair journeys, erin evans, a senior enterprise editor at huffpost who commissioned the articles for this project, told me from new york.
i knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. i saw an opportunity to push further in my career than i'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. i was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and i did. i scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. i put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. but no matter what i did, i'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. i'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.
i remained employed at the store for three years and only left because i eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. recently, i popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.
some people resist the idea of a formal meeting with their spouse. they think it sounds like work. why not just talk about things as they come up? talking on the fly sounds very nice, and that is fine if you are able to do this effectively.
as a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — i believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — olga baker

i first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the u.s., but that there's still a long way to go. self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.

the other big initiative in the alexander-collins proposal would resume cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which are a separate set of federal payments to insurers that president donald trump stopped in october.
democrats have noticed what the trump administration is doing and are hoping voters do, too. nationally, democratic candidates have made rising health care costs a central plank in their platform during this year's midterm elections, and tuesday's announcement provides them more fodder for their case that the gop is mishandling the health care system.
don't let democrats do to america what they've done to new york, giuliani said, declaring that republicans were the true anti-racists for their vigilance against the ordinary crime that kills so many black residents of major cities. for president trump and for us republicans, all black lives matter.
the american health care act ― the aca repeal-and-replace bill that the house passed and that trump threw a party for in the white house rose garden ― specifically was designed to make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get and keep their health insurance. in fact, the measure wouldn't have made it through the house if gop leaders hadn't made it more hostile to people with pre-existing conditions as a means to attract more conservative votes. this bill would have meant 23 million more uninsured people by 2026, according to the congressional budget office. the failed senate obamacare repeal bill authored by gop sens. bill cassidy (la.) and lindsey graham (s.c.) was the same.

let's start with one big difference: the american rescue plan is starting off a lot more popular than the 2009 stimulus. a cnn poll released wednesday found 61% of americans support the plan, including 58% of independents and 26% of republicans. only 37% of americans were firmly opposed to the legislation. other polls, including one from the pew research center, have found even higher levels of support.
the savings from this new cut account for less than half a percent of what the federal government is expected to spend to subsidized private coverage and medicaid next year.
the term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what trump is perpetrating. his claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
but the conversation covered a lot more than health care policy, because it's impossible to talk about the 2010 law without talking about the ways politics have been changing in the past decade, and how those changes affected what democrats were and weren't able to do. in many ways, the saga of the affordable care act is a case study in the challenges that progressives must overcome if they want to pass ambitious legislation ― challenges facing democrats now just as surely as they did during obama's tenure.

and here we see where mister ip is unequivocally misguided: further erode market forces in health care. market forces concern profits; healthcare concerns saving human lives.
in fact, although verma said a major goal of monday's guidance was to give states more flexibility, the guidance states explicitly that state waiver applications should foster health coverage through competitive private coverage... over public programs.

i was never under an illusion that we would get majority republican support, obama said. but it was my belief that a law signed by mitt romney, and that could be traced back to ideas that had appeared in the heritage foundation literature, would give some political cover to those republicans who were so inclined to vote for it.

the quote was relayed to huffpost numerous times in the course of reporting this story and has clearly made its way to the single-payer groups. pelosi's spokesman declined to comment on the primus quote.
reynolds' rationale on the meatpacking plants and the wisconsin court's thinking on the stay-at-home order, like the logic behind the broader push from some conservatives to ease social distancing rules, is that the costs of lockdown are too severe. sacrificing the well-being of some more vulnerable populations is necessary, this argument goes, in order to alleviate the hardships on the rest of the population.
in fact, as margot sanger-katz of the new york times pointed out on tuesday, eliminating coverage requirements for the pre-existing conditions could have all sorts of far-reaching effects, making it difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for the federal government to distribute tax credits that today help millions afford coverage.
there's a lot of things at play right now that are not left or right ― they're iowa issues, he said. it's our tariffs, it's these farmlands all around us.
the first is his claim that the entire republican party would always, and very strongly, protect patients with preexisting conditions. this simply isn't true. the gop has dedicated dozens of congressional votes over the years to repealing obamacare, including its protections blocking insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting health conditions. trump's justice department supports a lawsuit aiming to strike down the entire law that is soon to go before the supreme court. various republicans have tried to introduce legislation that could replace obamacare's protections, but health care experts have consistently said those bills would fall short of the protections the affordable care act offers.
at the flagship protest outside the supreme court in washington, d.c., hundreds of men and women showed up for abortion rights. democratic presidential candidates including sens. cory booker (n.j.), kirsten gillibrand (n.y.), amy klobuchar (minn.) and bernie sanders (vt.), rep. eric swalwell (calif.) and south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg all came as well.
the concept was notional until april 2006, when a state-level reform fitting those criteria became law in massachusetts, with the signature of a republican governor (mitt romney) and support of some conservative intellectuals (at the heritage foundation). it was proof of concept for the democrats ― including obama, who, while putting together his campaign health plan, was already thinking about what might get gop votes.
let's get this out of the way first: democrats don't have to do anything to protect people with pre-existing conditions because they already did. that law is called the affordable care act, it includes an ironclad guarantee that no one can be turned down for health insurance regardless of their medical histories, and then-president barack obama signed it on march 23, 2010.

the republican argument against obamacare - with which mister ip closes his article - is not wrong. i am sorry to report that obamacare, in its current incarnation, does function as a tax on the middle class to subsidize healthcare for the lower class. but when the white male ceos of all of the major health insurance companies earn $10 million to $15 million dollars per year and their companies are leaving the healthcare exchanges because they are supposedly losing money, is it really the lower class citizens who are bilking the system?

premiums are rising more quickly this year, with insurers requesting an average increase of 25 percent, according to charles gaba of acasignups.net. that's an average, with a great deal of variation ― and there are, in fact, people whose plans are getting dramatically more expensive next year.
that's why insurers are jacking up prices this year and why big commercial insurers are pulling out of some markets altogether. in some parts of the country, consumers have only one insurance option. meanwhile, even many of the insured still face high out-of-pocket costs ― and are finding the only affordable plans have narrow networks of providers.

in response, james has adopted a strategy republicans around the country have used. in a widely circulating television advertisement and in interviews with local journalists, james has cited a family member's medical problems ― specifically, his son's asthma ― as proof that he would always look out for people with preexisting conditions.
one of the most shocking things i found in this bill, and there were many, is on page 425, where the congress would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years, people in medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner ... all to do what's in society's best interest or your family's best interest and cut your life short. these are such sacred issues of life and death. government should have nothing to do with this.
without the mandate or some other policy device to keep healthy people buying coverage, most experts say insurers would have to charge everybody else even more ― and, partly as a consequence, fewer people would end up having insurance.
the idea was to make sure healthy people enrolled before they got sick, so they would have protection against bills, so that they wouldn't require charity care that would raise costs throughout the system, and so that insurers could keep premiums low and stable.

the year was 2009, and things did not end well for the democratic party. the stimulus legislation grew steadily less popular over time as job growth sputtered. the midterm election a year later would wipe out their massive house majority, and usher in a wave of austerity that further hampered the country's economic comeback.
sanders' transformation is evident in his policy agenda. the inclusion of abortion coverage in his single-payer health care bill won plaudits from women's groups. he commemorated the 50th anniversary of martin luther king's assassination in memphis, tennessee; held an anti-poverty rally with civil rights leader rev. william barber, in durham, north carolina; and convened a live panel discussion on economic inequality that prominently featured people who specialize in the unique barriers facing americans of color.
this week's low point, perhaps, was the president's childish tweet of an old trump pro wrestling video, modified to show him slamming to the ground and repeatedly punching a guy whose head was a cnn logo.
trump has made abortion and, more broadly, women's health care and women's rights, to be an issue in 2020, planned parenthood president leana wen told huffpost. he was the one who, during the state of the union, lied, deliberately spreading misinformation about abortion care and women's health care. he's the one who has made this a campaign issue. and we say: bring it on.
rules committee chairman jim mcgovern (d-mass.) contested the question of criteria for witnesses. he told huffpost in a statement that the committee had free [rein] to make all decisions about this hearing.
and people who want or need comprehensive insurance ― say, because they have diabetes or are cancer survivors ― are likely to have a harder time getting such coverage, because of how the markets will change.
the implication of leaving millions uninsured is a matter of life and death. a 2019 report on medicaid expansion found there could have been 15,600 fewer deaths if all 50 states expanded medicaid under the affordable care act. there's a growing body of research that has shown expanded public insurance has improved health outcomes, increasing preventative care and saving patients with chronic illnesses, like kidney disease.
this issue is essentially a health care issue, said kim baker, a co-chair with indivisible midlands (sc2), which is also fighting at the state level to stop the legislature from restricting abortion rights. then you bring in the extra attacks on women's autonomy and reproductive rights, and i think it will be a very big issue going into the 2020 elections.
surprise bills are one of the worst aspects of the u.s. health care system, and that's really saying something considering how awful it is in so many other ways. over the past couple of years, congress has tried and failed to devise a solution to this problem that would protect patients from unexpected bills from out-of-network providers the patients often don't even know treated them.
but a severe economic downturn was inevitable because people scared of the virus aren't going to engage in commercial activity like they did before. the actual choice policymakers face is whether or not to have the government provide for the population during this crisis ― by guaranteeing that people have money, food, housing and health insurance.
in a separate, prerecorded interview that ran sunday on nbc's today show, conway reiterated a promise she and other republican officials have made repeatedly: that nobody with insurance through obamacare right now would lose it in the transition to a new system.
and congress this year repealed the tax penalties associated with the individual mandate that most people obtain health coverage, effectively ending the mandate and removing a key incentive for less-expensive healthy consumers to pay into the insurance system. that will cause premiums to rise for those who remain in the exchange market.
and the obamacare issue raged on--this time with neville chamberlain making a guest appearance, an acting black hole who probably sucked the blood right out of lord grantham's ulcer.
a ruling against the law would unleash chaos

already, both sides are preparing their arguments. glen bolger, a republican pollster at public opinion strategies, predicted the legislation would get less popular over time as the public learned more about its non-covid-19 provisions.
states would have to quickly decide whether to continue covering some or all of these adults with their own funds, according to judy solomon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities. it's doubtful many would be able to do that.
such decreases may happen whenever the government cracks down on immigrants, a new study shows.
trump said he agreed to pulling the bill once ryan made it clear the legislation lacked the votes to pass.
what republicans have to do is turn it into midnight basketball, he said, referring to a program republicans attacked as frivolous in 1990s crime legislation. you have to say you support the bits of this that go to covid relief, but detail the pork that's in there. (in 2010, republicans attacked a stimulus-funded study that tested how monkeys reacted to cocaine.)
everybody is talking about how democrats need to avoid the traps that ensnared them during former president barack obama's first term, when they repeatedly got bogged down in bipartisan negotiations, made all sorts of substantive concessions on policy, and still got virtually no gop support for their initiatives.
pelosi herself has repeatedly refused to endorse a medicare for all approach to health care, insisting instead that the best way forward is to make fixes to the affordable care act. and even though the single-payer advocates we spoke to this week emphasized the importance of this hearing, there's wariness that the meeting could end up supporting pelosi's position.
the latest uproar came after alabama passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the country last week, banning the procedure with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. seven other states have also passed new anti-abortion laws, with additional measures pending in state legislatures.
we came really close today, but we came up short, ryan said at a press conference. this is a disappointing day for us.
associated press sen. thom tillis's bill allows him to say he stands with trump on obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
it was a far cry from the government-run insurance plan that harry truman once championed, but democratic leaders embraced it as the best they could get ― and so did obama, who repeated in our interview his belief that something like a government-run, single-payer system would probably work best, but creating one right away would be too difficult.
other republicans who are facing a competitive reelection fight are similarly choosing their words carefully when discussing obamacare.
the gop's hope is that by focusing on medicare for all, they can instead portray democrats ― even those who don't support the proposal ― as the extremists hoping to blow up the health care system.
both national conventions had their emotional, viral moments ― brayden harrington's speech about his stutter at the democratic national convention, widow ann dorn's tribute to her retired police officer husband at the gop celebration ― but neither had any type of game-changing moment to alter the fundamental story of the race: it is a referendum on president donald trump, with many voters disapproving of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, health care and racial justice. democratic nominee joe biden has a steady but not overwhelming lead in polls of the most crucial swing states.
the benefits of restoring the csrs, as they've come to be known, are more ambiguous than the benefits of funding reinsurance.
complicating matters further, republicans have been trying to pass repeal legislation through budget reconciliation ― an expedited process that would allow republicans to get a bill through the senate without the threat of a democratic filibuster, so that a simple majority vote would be sufficient.
biden didn't name sanders in his victory speech. but it was clear he was talking about the senator, who has surpassed biden in national polls. sanders is also poised to win big on super tuesday, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates deciding the democratic nomination will be up for grabs.
hospitals typically lay out multi-year operating plans that prioritize investments, such as new clinics, medical wings, technology or other projects that help draw in more patients and increase revenue. in addition to enhancing patient care, these projects are vital to the local economy as a driver of jobs ranging from construction and maintenance to restaurants and transportation.
it's hard to find a respected legal expert today who finds merit in this latest lawsuit. the basis for the states' argument is that congress originally intended for the pre-existing conditions protections to operate alongside the mandate; if the mandate is gone, the lawsuit reasons, then the pre-existing protections should go too.
obama's announcement was based on a report the department of health and human services published the same day, which found 17.7 million working-age adults became insured between the beginning of obamacare's first enrollment period in 2013 and the close of this year's sign-up campaign last month. the department estimates 2.3 million adults under the age of 26 got covered through the law's provision allowing young adults to remain on their parents' policies.
no! sanders replied. i'm just waking up.
and on top of everything else, republicans were fighting an increasingly skeptical public. multiple polls have suggested the gop measure is deeply unpopular, while the law it aimed to replace, long the subject of controversy and the object of scorn among conservatives, is now becoming more popular.
another conservative pundit, ben shapiro, was even more direct: if somebody who is 81 dies of covid-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of covid-19, shapiro said, adding later, if grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, that's tragic and it's terrible, also the life expectancy in the united states is 80, so that is not the same thing.
but monday's rule change almost certainly means that, overall, people with serious medical problems are likely to have a harder time finding coverage ― and, ultimately, paying their medical bills.
there are plenty of other reasons the speech's effect will be limited: the inappropriate use of the white house and lack of social distancing among the rose garden crowd will overshadow the speech's content, and two bigger news stories ― the aftermath of the police shooting of jacob blake in kenosha, wisconsin, and a major hurricane hitting the gulf coast ― may overshadow its existence entirely.
to process what the candidates were saying, it helps to get an accurate picture of what's actually happening with obamacare these days.
the kids are born u.s. citizens, he says. they have a right to get food. we're going to have a huge population that will struggle. we might not see it now, but we will in 20 years, when these kids come into the workforce.
while republicans claim they want the law to protect both people with pre-existing conditions and people who rely on government programs for health coverage, those ideas are ideologically at odds with fundamental tenets of american conservatism. lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller federal government are incompatible with a safety net worth its name.
washington ― democrats are gearing up to turn abortion into a key issue for the 2020 elections, saying it could turn out to be an issue that mirrors the fight to preserve the affordable care act in 2018.
researchers looked at latino enrollment in food stamps between 2006 and 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. they found that after the federal government began stepping up deportation efforts, latino immigrant enrollment in snap and the aca dropped. (the aca wasn't passed until 2010, and went into effect in 2014.)
we didn't adequately explain what we had done, biden said during a conversation with house democrats last week, reflecting on the passage of the 2009 law. barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a 'victory lap.' i kept saying, 'tell people what we did.' he said, 'we don't have time. i'm not going to take a victory lap.' and we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.
obama traveled to milwaukee because the city bested other locations in a challenge to sign up the most people in the enrollment period that recently ended. close to 13 million enrolled in private coverage via the obamacare health insurance exchanges this year.
trump's call-in on a 2014 fox & friends episode, which was posted thursday by raw story, appears to reveal his willingness to tolerate almost any disaster to get what he wants.
they're afraid if they do anything, they'll be deported, monestel said.
speculation in november and early december, captured in national headlines, questioned the strength of biden's frontrunner status in south carolina, but the most recent survey showed him with a comfortable lead. the fox news poll conducted in early january showed him 21 percentage points ahead of runners-up billionaire tom steyer, who has been investing heavily in the south carolina primary. close behind steyer were sens bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts.
that's significant, said randy capps, director of research for u.s. programs at the migration policy institute, a nonpartisan think tank based out of washington.
james, a 39-year-old west point graduate who flew apache helicopters in iraq, is a rare bright spot in what's been a dismal campaign season for the republican party nationally. trump's chances of winning reelection seem lower every day, and the gop's 53-47 senate majority is in jeopardy, with incumbents from even strongly conservative states, including georgia and south carolina, suddenly looking vulnerable.
he has not said publicly why he is leaving, and he has not responded to emails from media outlets, including huffpost, which tried to contact him last week. but the circumstances and timing could indicate it is connected with the affordable care act lawsuit.
moreover, the progress in growing the exchanges and in covering the uninsured may be stalling. total enrollment on the exchanges barely grew compared to last year, and those who remain uninsured are considered the most difficult to locate and persuade. that's especially true for households that earn too much to qualify for health insurance subsidies.
chip somodevilla/getty images sanders and rep. sheila jackson lee (d-texas) walked with rev. william barber of north carolina, a civil rights leader, during a capitol hill protest in 2017 of the gop efforts to repeal obamacare. barber ended up being arrested.
when asked in an april interview with huffpost whether he had grown more sensitive to the need to speak to the particular challenges facing black americans ― who comprise just a sliver of vermont's population ― sanders admitted that he had.
it's a great turnout. and it's kind of funny, i was told that there were no progressives in south carolina, he deadpanned to an approving crowd.
single-payer advocates also pointed out that the rules committee worked with jayapal and sanders, and these advocates also believe the final witnesses aren't bad. they just wish there were someone who would more forcefully make the case for medicare for all.
health care has been a politically damaging issue for republicans, who before the pandemic repeatedly attempted to repeal obamacare, end medicaid expansion and significantly cut medicaid funding. the trump administration has continued to support a gop lawsuit to dismantle the affordable care act and pushed an effort to add work requirements for medicaid. since the pandemic, the trump administration promised to use some of the coronavirus stimulus funds to reimburse hospitals treating uninsured patients with covid-19, but there has been no plan to address the growing millions of uninsured americans more generally.
circumstances could always change. but for now, it looks like those reservations have left the proposal without the support it needs to get through congress ― as part of this new spending bill and, perhaps, as part of any other legislation this year.
not surprisingly, it was trump himself who took this to a ridiculous level last week when he tweeted: republicans will totally protect people with pre-existing conditions, democrats will not! vote republican.
wednesday's ruling was criticized by leading reproductive health and civil rights groups.
officials in both parties have said this is a major problem they want to address. democrats have proposed a variety of options, all of which entail some combination of bolstering the affordable care act's financial assistance, using government to control prices and creating new public plans that can offer alternative coverage.
courtesy barack obama presidential library. joe biden, seen here with then-president barack obama celebrating house passage of the affordable care act in 2010, now has a chance to reinforce and build on the health care law in a way that obama never did.
the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions would no longer be in effect, less-visible reforms covering everything from billing fraud to food calorie postings would vanish, and the entire health care system could plunge into chaos.
oral arguments were presented in may via teleconference ― one of the first times in history for the court ― due to the coronavirus pandemic. it was the third time that the birth control mandate reached the supreme court, but the first since gorsuch and kavanaugh ― appointed by president donald trump ― joined the bench.
i often say that knowing when to leave a party is an art form.
without the stepped-up immigration enforcement of secure communities, alsan and yang estimate that aca enrollment among latino immigrants would be 22 percent higher.
the policy of the united states is an empty phrase. it's not a law. it's not even an actual policy. also, the current real policy of the united states on this issue is encoded in a law called the affordable care act that trump is trying to get rid of.
it was a starter home. it's been vandalized. and people at times tried to undermine its foundations. but it's held up.
the roads around bethlehem baptist church are lined with signs promoting obamacare. the gas station around the corner from the church is named obama gas, its sign emblazoned with a portrait of the 44th president.
in our interview, obama still seemed taken aback that republican state officials were refusing to expand medicaid eligibility, as the affordable care act envisioned, even though the federal government had committed to covering most of the cost and literally millions of low-income americans scattered across states like florida, georgia and texas stood to get insurance.
the original impetus for guaranteeing csr payments was to avoid disruption, since insurers had been counting upon those payments and trump was loudly threatening to stop them (as he eventually did). last fall, alexander, who is chairman of the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, worked closely with his democratic counterpart, ranking minority member patty murray of washington state, on a bill that would have funded csrs. it was a rare show of genuine bipartisanship.
the legal theory of the plaintiffs includes a series of arguments that scholars from across the political spectrum have criticized and, occasionally, mocked. how can there be a command to get insurance when the consequence for disobeying it is literally nothing? do the people bringing the lawsuit even have standing to sue?
even at a time when doctors offices are closed and elective procedures are not going on — though as time goes on those things are going to be open — even being able to pay for your prescriptions is where having insurance versus not having insurance is going to make a big difference, miller said.
the trump administration's campaign to undermine the affordable care act notched another achievement tuesday.
just to take one example, experts have warned for years that underpaid, overworked staff and weak inspection regimens put nursing home residents at greater risk of infection. but since taking office, the trump administration has been rolling back safety regulations. as recently as three weeks ago, even as covid-19 was continuing to ravage nursing homes, administration officials were defending that effort.
when we get rid of those lines, you have competition and we'll be able to keep pre-existing and help people that can't get, don't have money because we are going to have people protected. and republicans feel this way. believe it or not and strongly this way. we're going to block grant. into the states. block grant into medicaid. so we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
during his visit earlier this week, macron tried to appeal to trump's fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and iran's role in funding regional conflicts. merkel is to repeat that message friday, according to western european diplomats.
this guidance suggests the federal government will allow states to target assistance differently, as verma confirmed monday, which could mean giving people more assistance if they buy short-term or other alternative plans ― and less assistance if they stick with comprehensive coverage.
the claim was so outrageous that politifact named it the lie of the year.
if sanders or other national democratic leaders are going to bring national attention to republican policies in the state that have led to hospital closures and higher utility bills, robertson said, let 'em come.
for trump's true believers, it is precisely that bulldog nature that makes him such a draw. standing outside the hotel where the conference was held, nigel farage ― the former leader of the u.k. independence party, brexit champion and closest approximation to trump that england can offer ― scoffed at a query about what trump might do to possibly disappoint.
but there was little in the speech that the trump campaign had not tried before without success.
monday's announcement represents the latest in a series of gop efforts to accomplish through regulation what republicans could not accomplish through legislation when they tried, and just barely failed, to pass legislation that would have repealed the affordable care act outright.
sessions also took a break from his work to help trump's private prison owner donors, and to hurt gravely ill people who depend on medical marijuana, to appear last friday on the morning show fox & friends. despite his announced decision to recuse himself from the russiagate investigation, sessions offered thoughts on the russiagate investigation, including, when pressed by the fox hosts about concerns that special counsel robert mueller has hired lawyers connected to democratic politics, this comment: well, mr. mueller, is entitled, lawfully, i guess at this point, to hire who he desires, but i think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people. fairly bland, but a less disgraceful attorney general could have said, i'm recused from this matter so i can't comment on it. especially since a march 2 memo from jody hunt, sessions' chief of staff, said the ag's commitment to recuse on the investigation covers speaking with the media: the attorney general's recusal is not only with respect to such investigations, if any, but also extends to department responses to congressional and media inquiries related to any such investigations. george w. bush white house ethics lawyer richard painter flatly told politico that sessions should not be doing this.
at 74, eduardo lacayo is a retired construction worker from nicaragua with a permanent green card and two bad knees. he relies on food stamps, but they don't stretch very far, so he hits up the food pantry at the spanish catholic center every week.
in comparison to the 2009 law, which contained a relatively paltry $25 boost to weekly unemployment checks, the covid-19 relief bill offers a $300-a-week boost, along with $1,400 checks for most americans and an expanded child tax credit that should regularly funnel money to poor and working class families soon.
over the course of his day-and-a-half in iowa, sanders participated in no fewer than four campaign events for j.d. scholten, who is waging a long-shot bid to unseat infamous white nationalist rep. steve king in iowa's heavily rural 4th congressional district.
the mandate is among the affordable care act's most controversial features, but experts say it's essential for making the rest of the program work. it's basically a tax on people who decline to get health insurance, even if available coverage meets the law's definition of affordable.
there's no evidence that trump cares about health care at all beyond his intense desire to undo anything president barack obama did in office. has there been anything about trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic to suggest that the health and well-being of americans is a priority for him? two hundred thousand dead say otherwise.
i'd stand behind him until he is impeached, said eric finch of west virginia. because he is my president and i respect the office and the process. i'd probably go out and call for his impeachment if he shot someone. but there has to be a process. and i imagine there would be a story. maybe the guy attacked him, or secret service wasn't there.
the term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what trump is perpetrating. his claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
i traveled to 48 states in this country. i have traveled to many, many african american communities and i have talked to a whole lot of people, he said. and i hope my views change in response to what i have learned.
that includes requirements affecting which benefits insurance plans cover, as well as requirements on who gets financial assistance and how much, and how the people choosing insurance can use that assistance.
under the alexander-collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or csr funds could pay for abortion services. if that were to become law, then it's almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.
the death panel concept first got attention in july 2009, when elizabeth mccaughey, an analyst and former lieutenant governor of new york, told a conservative radio host she had discovered an explosive feature of the democratic health care proposal congress was considering.
in 2017, congress reduced the penalty to zero, as part of the republican tax cut bill that trump signed. twenty republican state officials then filed a new lawsuit, arguing that if the penalty was zero, the mandate ― whose language remains part of the statute ― can no longer be a tax.
over the next two weeks i'll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers, trump crowed at a news conference friday at his bedminster golf resort in new jersey. that's a big thing. i've always been very strongly in favor. we have to cover preexisting conditions.
but if you remember the promise, you may also remember how empty it was.
but it has been done before. health insurance companies have been required to cover people with preexisting conditions ever since the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, was enacted 10 years ago.
now my republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the american people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! he mused, drawing laughs from the crowd.
fixing the senate ― and democracy
republicans have offered a number of bills intended to show their commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions ― a move designed to blunt democratic attacks over health care in 2020.
at the same time, the administration is loosening regulations on certain types of health insurance policies to allow insurers to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions. that's part of trump's ongoing campaign to sabotage the affordable care act's health insurance markets.
and a political threat continues to loom over obamacare, the republican congress is again vowing to develop a plan to replace the law, although they've made little noticeable progress since obama signed the aca six years ago this month.
i strongly doubt [trump] understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement. richard nephew, former state department official
greg ip wrote a fascinating, extremely well-researched and only marginally biased article in the wall street journal entitled the unstable economics in obama's health law. as a healthcare provider as well as an affordable care act participant, i was sent this article because i have been researching possible solutions to the lose-lose-lose debacle that obamacare has become.
obviously, obama said, that did not prove to be the case.
republicans are reminding america that they are in the minority on most of these important issues. sometimes all of us have unpopular positions, that they've taken it to such an extreme that it puts an exclamation point on just how far removed they are from the majority of the american people, buttigieg told huffpost.
millions would lose insurance, insurance protections
and then there would be effects that have nothing to do with health insurance. the law is the reason that restaurant chains must post calorie counts on their menus, for example. it modified the indian health service and changed the approval process for so-called biosimilar drugs.
this article also appears on republic report.
the iran deal is a terrible deal. we paid $150 billion. we gave $1.8 billion in cash. that's actual cash, barrels of cash. it's insane. it's ridiculous. it should have never been made, trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.
we're eyes wide open to the fact that when it's signed, we can't just cease our communication efforts, white house press secretary jen psaki, who helped lead communications efforts around the stimulus bill, told huffpost in an interview. i think it'll be different than what we did with the [2009 stimulus].
an april 2017 bill to make $15 the federal minimum wage, which once had paltry support from his colleagues, now enjoys majority support within the senate's democratic ranks. and most recently, sanders and rep. ro khanna (d-calif.) successfully pressured amazon into adopting a $15 minimum wage.
you can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass, obama said. and that can't be how any democracy functions over time. if you ask me what has contributed to the cynicism ― of government, and to some degree what contributed to the cynicism around the health care initiative ― it's the fact that a small minority of people can put a halt to everything.
stephen colbert has torn into house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) over his apparent delight at millions of americans potentially losing their health insurance.
the news was first reported by robert costa of the washington post, who spoke to the president directly, following a meeting between trump and house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.).
the speech jumped around from attack to attack ― hitting biden for being weak on china, then for becoming allied with progressive sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), then back to being weak on china, then to his support for late-term abortion, then back to biden being a trojan horse for socialists ― without sticking to any one cohesive theme.
john james, a michigan republican running for the u.s. senate, represents one of the gop's best chances to take a seat away from the democrats.
likewise, a number of pilot programs to reengineer medicare payments for health care, in order to improve the program's efficiency and promote better quality care, are now underway. the experiments are taking place through the center for medicare and medicaid innovation, which the affordable care act authorizes and finances.
trump's demand was an audacious act of political brinkmanship, designed to rattle and win over dissident republican lawmakers who, for various reasons, were objecting to the bill.
trump barely engaged in the 2017 legislative fight to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with a gop plan that would have kicked tens of millions of americans off their health care. after that failed, he gave up even trying to legislate on health care, and instead, his administration turned its focus to sabotaging the aca's health insurance marketplaces, imposing onerous new requirements on medicaid beneficiaries, promoting the sale of junk health insurance policies that, unlike aca plans, do exclude people with preexisting conditions, and getting the courts to kill the aca for him.
if the irs 'delays' the individual mandate, the insurance markets in many states could go into a tailspin. rates for 2018 will skyrocket and some insurers could fold, nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan and expert on obamacare, explained at the incidental economist blog.
this time, democrats insist, will be different. the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, dubbed the american rescue plan, provides far more direct relief to americans than the 2009 legislation. the white house, full of veterans of president barack obama's administration, and democratic outside groups are preparing to wage an extended political battle to make sure voters appreciate the aid they're receiving.
when huffpost reached baker by phone, he made it clear that he thinks a medicare buy-in approach makes more sense financially and pragmatically from a health care perspective. he also said it was reasonable that single-payer supporters may want a more forceful advocate of medicare for all.
with so many more patients covered, hospital margins grew and days of cash-on-hand climbed. such financial improvements enabled the hospital to invest in new projects, including the pena family health center in southwest denver. the hospital planned to construct three more clinics, to expand two existing clinics, and to build a new parking garage to drive new revenues and expand its coverage.
a primary goal was to help people likely to struggle with medical bills because of their physical condition or finances ― which is why, for example, democrats wanted to prohibit insurers from denying policies to people with pre-existing conditions and to improve coverage of prescription drugs for seniors.
i'm hoping this next episode they'll discover a roof leak, moles in the beautiful lawns, poachers, and maybe even a stolen snuff box which will bring the show full circle!
associated press/patrick semansky sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), a democratic presidential candidate, speaks about medicare for all on wednesday in washington.
who knows what's going to happen? lacayo said, before dashing off.
sanctuary policies make a difference, he said. they reduce the level of fear.
what i did not see, for example, was republican governors refusing [federal] medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people, obama said. we've never seen in american history a situation in which state governments reject benefits for their people purely on ideological grounds.
before the affordable care act, it already was illegal for health insurance companies to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them more based on their medical histories if they got coverage through a group plan, like from an employer. and insurers and employers are limited in how much they could refuse to pay for treatments related to a pre-existing condition for group policyholders. the affordable care act extended similar protections to people who buy their health insurance directly or via the exchanges the law created.
when devos declined to commit to proceeding with the gainful employment rule at her confirmation hearing in january, senator elizabeth warren (d-ma), said, swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like that.
ending the filibuster wasn't on the political agenda in the way it is now. and democratic leaders rejected the idea of using the budget reconciliation process, where they wouldn't have to worry about the filibuster, in part because they thought its complex parliamentary rules would prohibit essential parts of the proposal, turning legislation into swiss cheese.
the goal of the advertising is to remind liberal-leaning young people that one of the two old men vying for the presidency agrees with them on the issues a lot more than the other does. one of nextgen's first ads is design to rebut the idea that there is little difference between biden and trump, comparing and contrasting biden's pledge to expand health care coverage with trump's support for repealing obamacare; and biden's support for clean energy with trump's backing of unchecked pollution, among other issues.
for the last two years, republicans promised to protect preexisting conditions while trying to gut them. for the next two years, they may pretend to abandon health care repeal, but they're doing everything they can to repeal, sabotage and overturn it, said jesse ferguson, a top democratic strategist. if they were serious about stopping health care repeal, they would be doing something to stop trump's department of justice from trying to strike down the entire law.

that said, sarah miller, a health economist with university of michigan, pointed out there are still real financial and health impacts.
the majority of consumers get tax credits that discount premiums, sometimes so deeply that coverage is basically free, and that's one reason that the number of people without insurance has fallen to historic lows while access to care appears to have improved. but plenty of middle- and upper-income people are stuck paying more ― and in some cases coverage is now flat-out unaffordable.
having last week joined trump and tom price in offering the old gop deception that a bill cutting health care benefits is not actually a cut; and saying that people cut off from obamacare could simply get jobs to fix the problem, even though many jobs don't come with health benefits, kellyanne conway offered up a new swipe at americans who may lose some health coverage if the latest gop health care bill is enacted. addressing the impact on opioid addicts of gop cuts to medicaid, after trump early this year pledged to expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted, conway said such patients can overcome such funding shortfalls with a four-letter word called 'will.' senator ed markey (d-ma), whose state saw nearly 2,000 opioid overdose deaths last year, responded that conway owes an apology to the entire addiction and treatment community for her outrageous and disrespectful remarks.
in cities that began cooperating with secure communities, food stamp enrollment among immigrants dropped by 19 percent within five years, the report found. but in sanctuary cities around the country, there was no drop-off in snap and aca enrollment. (the study included data from the pew research center, which, like stateline, is funded by the pew charitable trusts.)
the gop's empty promises on health care
thanks to president biden and democrats, help is on the way, a narrator declares in the ad.
you get the program started, you figure out what the kinks are, what works, what doesn't. you amend, build, improve, refine ― that kind of iterative process, where you've set a goal and gotten the foundations laid, and then congress in a cooperative fashion works to keep making it better. that process, which is very beneficial because you're getting real data and feedback about what's working and what's not ― that's less available to you now. the process that built social security, built medicaid, medicare, that only works if you got both parties working in good faith.
just hours after his inauguration on friday, trump signed an executive order instructing the hhs to waive, defer, grant exemptions from taxes and penalties associated with the affordable care act.
so, again, his plan is to not have a plan. if he had one, he would tell us.
one thing is certain, he said: snap is the nation's first line of defense against hunger.
a top white house adviser said sunday that the trump administration may use its executive authority to weaken or effectively eliminate obamacare's individual mandate.
in south carolina, black voters don't need to be pressed hard to say what draws them to biden. it's obama.
another possible gop partner was iowa sen. charles grassley, who had worked closely with the top ranking democrat on the finance committee, montana's max baucus, on the medicare drug program under president george w. bush. they had a close relationship and, at a private meeting of several senators that baucus convened just after the election in 2008, grassley said, i haven't heard anything here i don't like … i can't think of an issue that isn't compromise-able, according to the notes one participant took.
he then challenged his fellow contenders for the democratic presidential nomination to pledge the same, dedicating a new webpage on his campaign site to the appeal.
that's an important shift because sometime this month the agency is expected to publish a regulation that would permit consumers to carry these plans for a full year. that means the plans will be competing for business more directly with the comprehensive insurance listed on the exchanges.
columbia, s.c. ― south carolina was the site of one of vermont sen. bernie sanders' most humiliating defeats in his 2016 presidential run. he received just 26 percent of the vote in the palmetto state's early primary, presaging a shutout in the south that virtually assured hillary clinton the democratic nomination.
to make matters more disgraceful, devos justified her harmful decision with a gross misstatement. gainful employment regulations, she said in a press release, have been repeatedly challenged by educational institutions and overturned by the courts. devos was right that the rules had been challenged over and over by schools ― many of them the predatory schools that risked losing their federal aid under the rules if they didn't shape up and stop deceiving, overcharging, and under-educating students. but her characterization of what the courts had done with the rule was false.
a key change in individual taxes could occur with the revision of tax brackets. trump's proposal calls for reducing tax brackets for individuals from seven to three set at 10, 25, and 35 percent. according to the wall street journal, this reduces the amount of taxes on individual income for those earning over $699,000 by $214,000, while their ultimate share of all federal taxes reduces to 25 percent. this will benefit the wealthy since the top tax rate decreases from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.
the organizations will almost certainly respond by downsizing and scaling back services, so that they end up providing less help, reaching fewer people, or both.
the obama administration expended tremendous effort shaping and nurturing the new system during its infancy and addressing problems as they came up. now the trump administration is in charge of managing these marketplaces, and its intentions are not clear.
it's very disturbing and it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular ― medicare, social security and medicaid, mcconnell told bloomberg tv. hopefully at some point here we'll get serious about this, he said. mcconnell went on to lament that it was a shame obama and congress weren't able to figure out how to ruin these programs together and bizarrely asserted that total gop control of the federal government somehow made this more difficult.
whether obama could have pushed conservative democrats harder, or picked different places to give ground, remains a source of disagreement between him and some of his liberal allies even today. what's not in dispute is that obama always realized the law would need more work. that's why he talked about it as a starter home, with the expectation that it would be possible to bolster and expand the program over time, through a series of legislative and administrative fixes.
republicans have rejected all of those options, arguing that they would entail too much taxation, spending or regulation ― and ultimately do more harm than good. their preferred strategy is to roll back the law's existing regulations and, in many cases, reduce financial assistance. monday's action is consistent with that approach.
in an effort to regain his footing, sanders has sought to emphasize to voters that while other candidates, including warren and harris, have adopted signature policies like medicare for all, the integrity with which he would fight for them is unrivaled.

but some experts supported the decision and, just two years later, the supreme court would invalidate doma as unconstitutional.
last month, consumer and patient advocates launched a lawsuit of their own, arguing that some of the trump administration's rule changes violate the affordable care act's coverage guarantees. it's not clear whether the changes the administration announced monday will provoke similar lawsuits, or how vulnerable the rule change could be.
pigs were mentioned with enough regularity to make you hope one of them would be brought in to dinner with a gilded apple in its mouth. or someone would use the word swine. i can't believe it's not bacon!
those changes are one reason the number of americans without health insurance is so much lower than it was before the affordable care act became law.
i think it's been an interesting idea to generate conversation about how we best provide health care to people, sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.) said on tuesday when asked if she could support a version of medicare for all. i'm interested in doing everything we can as quickly as possible to give as many people access to health care as we can, and i don't think that will do it ... i think there are other ways to cover people faster.
the most potent symbol of how they pivoted away from jobs was that they put then-vice president joe biden in charge of it, he said.
attorney general jeff sessions mysteriously cancelled his speech set for today (thursday) in philadelphia to discuss his heavy-handed efforts to pressure so-called sanctuary cities to stop providing protections for undocumented immigrants.
congressional gop leaders are playing the same game. in an interview with bloomberg tv this month, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) used one side of his mouth to say, there's nobody in the senate that i'm familiar with who is not in favor of coverage of pre-existing conditions, and the other side to say, i don't fault the administration for trying to give us an opportunity to do this differently and to go in a different direction.
what they want is a hearing that's not about medicare for all, one source involved in planning the hearing told huffpost. they want someone to say, 'hey, there's all these different ways of doing things, none of them are bad, they're all equally good.'
but once trump made his decision and the csr money stopped flowing, insurers in most states reacted quickly, jacking up premiums exclusively on customers who were eligible for tax credits. by design, those tax credits rise in tandem with premiums, which means those consumers didn't end up paying more out of their own pockets. they simply got bigger tax credits, which meant greater spending by the federal government.
some of the state officials who started this lawsuit are trying to have it both ways.
the regulation about short-term plans isn't in place yet, but a prior regulation opened the door to more association health plans that allow businesses to band together to offer health coverage to workers but that don't have to follow all of the affordable care act's rules, including those guaranteeing a basic set of covered benefits.
and what is the republican solution? cutting medicare, social security and medicaid, of course!
as millions of americans slip into unemployment and lose their health insurance during a public health crisis, senate republicans still see no need to act on health care.
this is pretty terrible, jodi ray, who is the project director for florida covering kids and families, told huffpost. we will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources.
ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said tyler, the former campaign aide to cruz.
declines in snap and aca enrollment were largest in mixed status households where some people are in the country legally and some are not, the study found. for example, one family member may be a citizen, another an asylee or a permanent resident, and still another undocumented.
when the committee analyzed trump's plans, by contrast, it determined that they would add $5.3 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years.
while the rules committee and pelosi's staff contest leadership's role in choosing witnesses, sources close to the process insist primus was intimately involved.
this is playing out in arizona, where kingman regional medical center is taking cost-cutting measures by renegotiating medical supply and service contracts. the university of alabama at birmingham health system, which includes six hospitals, is largely holding off hiring non-clinical staff, a trend also evident in national data.
rumors fuel the fear, said maricela delcid, a navigator at the nonprofit who helps eligible immigrants enroll in social services. most of the immigrant parents she works with are undocumented, and therefore don't qualify for benefits such as food stamps. but they don't understand that they can apply on behalf of their u.s.-born children, delcid said.
almost unbelievably, trump's action on surprise billing is even more fake than his preexisting conditions nonsense. we will end surprise billing, he said. no, they won't.
it is indeed true that biden voted to approve permanent normalized trade relations with china in 2000. experts estimate that from 1999 to 2011, the u.s. lost between 2 million and 2.4 million manufacturing jobs due to increased competition with china. as a candidate, sanders also slammed biden for his vote to open up u.s.-china trade.
yes, insurance companies wouldn't be allowed to refuse to offer coverage to someone who, for example, has a history of cancer or is pregnant. but they could sell someone a policy that doesn't cover cancer treatments or the birth of a child.
some would end up not getting coverage at all, which is why, according to the cbo, the number of people without insurance would actually rise if the alexander-collins proposal became law, although the increase would be small.
it was a difficult undertaking, he said. what they succeeded and what they did has improved the lives and saved the lives of countless, countless people.
i'm stunned jared and ivanka didn't squirm so hard they went into full body dry heaves. https://t.co/kw3rugts82 — jon cryer (@mrjoncryer) september 1, 2018
this is what the obama administration argued in 2011 when it declined to defend the defense of marriage act (doma), which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. the decision was controversial, with even some of the administration's own lawyers cautioning that it set a bad precedent.
in 2008, the department of homeland security started a partnership, the secure communities program, that cross-checked the fingerprints of people arrested at the local level with the agency's database of deportable individuals. the program ran until 2014, and was reinstated last year. it resulted in the deportation of more than 363,000 immigrants charged with crimes.
this new guidance allows states to set up parallel insurance markets that may be able to attract healthy people with plans that have lower premiums but fewer consumer protections, leaving aca plans with a sicker pool and higher premiums, larry levitt, senior vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, told huffpost on monday.
this is actually an argument that alexander and collins have sometimes made to their colleagues ― that it's in the gop's self-interest to find bipartisan agreement on policies to reduce health insurance premiums. it looks like that argument is not carrying the day.
the phrase death panels became part of america's political vocabulary in 2009, when republicans were trying to stop the legislation that eventually became the affordable care act.
cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. day one, i will rip to shreds the iran deal, he repeated at a north carolina rally on march 7, 2016.
to get covered, americans will have to navigate the country's fragmented health care system ― there's the aca, known as obamacare, public options like medicaid, and cobra, the federal program that lets individuals continue their former employer's health care plan at personal cost. as huffpost's jeffrey young explained, there are barriers to all these options.
to be sure, it's hard to make a clear comparison between medicaid expansion and growing numbers of uninsured, especially because health care providers have only recently begun loosening restrictions around preventative care checkups and other services that were deemed nonessential during the early weeks of the pandemic.
johnson ultimately prevailed in 1965 against stiff industry resistance to create medicare for seniors and people with disabilities, sanders recalled.
that's not all. the white house budget request this year called for $250 billion in medicaid cuts over a decade. the house republican budget proposal called for reviving the american health care act's medicaid cuts. and the trump administration is encouraging states to impose work requirements on medicaid enrollees, a policy designed to reduce enrollment in the program. that plan is already working as intended in arkansas.
it's unclear how precisely that would work out because a law was enacted in 2018 to close the doughnut hole ahead of schedule. that legislation was a modification of the affordable care act, and judges would have to sort out what that modification means if the aca comes off the books.
8. thomas bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. last week's ranking: ―
associated press joe biden's strategy for winning the democratic presidential nomination hinges in part on a convincing win in south carolina's feb. 29 primary. here, he campaigns at an oyster roast event on sunday in orangeburg, s.c.
among those who fought hardest against the republicans' repeal efforts were organizations representing people with disabilities, people with serious diseases and the elderly.
yoon s. byun/the boston globe via getty images volunteers gather bags of groceries for people seeking assistance at a food pantry in concord, massachusetts. a new study finds a correlation between stepped-up immigration efforts and a drop in immigrants enrolling in food stamps. advocates say fear is a driving factor.
here's what she said about obamacare in 2009:
that's why both health care plans put forward by biden and harris leave some form of a private insurance system largely in place. sanders, meanwhile, has no qualms about eliminating the private insurance system altogether. he argues that not doing so would leave too many americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers while driving up costs for everybody.
the president is declaring that it is the policy of the united states to provide protections to ensure that americans with preexisting conditions are protected regardless of whether the affordable care act is unconstitutional and its protections for preexisting conditions invalidated, health and human services secretary alex azar said during a conference call with reporters prior to trump's speech.
if the court decides to throw out the affordable care act, even in part, devising a replacement will fall to whoever is in the white house and whoever is running congress. in other words, a lot would depend on who wins in november and what they are prepared to do.
but the weakest argument, the one that has prompted so many of the law's critics to dismiss it, is about a concept called severability. under a well-established doctrine, judges ruling part of a law unconstitutional are supposed to do minimal damage to the rest of the law if they can.
dakota workman, 22, from west virginia, said the white house was not operating, as trump insisted, like a fine-tuned machine, though he noted that no administration is this early on. but he appreciated the new coal regulations, the ban on lobbying and trump's supreme court pick even more. if the president backpedaled on obamacare repeal, he said, he'd be upset with congress and start thinking about ditching trump. i sucked up my pride and voted for him more because it was about beating hillary clinton, workman explained.
7. kellyanne conway, counselor to the president. last week's ranking: 8
since enrollment started in 2014, the affordable care act brought significant changes to denver health medical center, a safety-net hospital with the busiest trauma center in colorado. historically, nearly two-thirds of patients were either uninsured or covered by medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.
the high cost of insurance, even with the affordable care act in place, has been a major source of discontent with the law, especially among people in relatively good health who were able to purchase insurance previously ― and who had to pay more after the law took effect, because insurers for the first time were covering bills from people with severe medical needs.
many wondered why ivanka and jared were there. while some questioned whether they were even invited, new york times white house correspondent katie rogers cleared that up, reporting saturday that mccain's friend sen. lindsey graham asked ivanka to attend.
overcoming this reality has proven difficult. hampton offers a perfect example. she works in the health insurance industry, and health care is her biggest priority. her policy preferences more resemble sanders and warren's vision of a government-run health insurance system than biden's proposal to expand a public option within a private system.
but trump's hold on the crowd had as much to do with party as personality. people at cpac approved of trumpism as much as, if not more than, trump himself. and their loyalty to the party was, perhaps, supreme.
olivier douliery/getty images democratic presidential nominee joe biden has a long record of moderate positions on crime, including his current opposition to police funding cuts, that trump wants americans to forget.
his return-to-greatness vision came as he and the fox panel blasted obamacare as a freebie for those who don't want to work. obamacare isn't free, and recipients pay premiums.
in charlotte, north carolina, on thursday, trump signed executive orders he claims address two of the biggest concerns americans have about the health care system: coverage for people with preexisting conditions and surprise medical bills.
now my republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the american people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.)
how trump could weaken the mandate
another person submitted to the committee for consideration told huffpost that, while no one in the single-payer world wants to say this hearing is a farce, there's a significant concern it will be co-opted into a defense of the affordable care act.
what we have found is not that people are so crazy about joe biden. it's that they really love president obama. shaun king, a civil rights activist and surrogate for sen. bernie sanders' presidential campaign.
this article has been updated throughout, including with details about contributions to harris' campaign.
she also said on tuesday that she would not raise middle class taxes to pay for the program.
worse still, his south carolina defeat epitomized the difficulty he had attracting support from black voters, a core constituency for the democratic party.
washington ― it's supposed to be the first congressional hearing ever on medicare for all ― a huge win for single-payer advocates and progressives in congress. but next week, when the house rules committee holds that landmark hearing on the expansive health care legislation, medicare for all advocates may actually be getting screwed.
but a lack of action on health care could have its own political consequences. if the polls are right, voters will hold republicans, not democrats, responsible for problems with the affordable care act ― and for problems with health care more generally.
this decision reflects cms' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated exchanges to their most cost-effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process, verma said.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) on monday released her version of medicare for all, a plan to create a new, government-run insurance plan designed to cover all americans and pay for nearly all their medical expenses. the proposal would likely eliminate existing employer-sponsored plans, over the course of a decadelong transition, but allow private insurers to offer an alternative form of coverage, much as they do today for seniors on medicare.
that promise would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep if the trump administration weakens or eliminates the mandate on its own, before a new health care system is in place.
after a standing-room-only rally over the weekend at iowa state, sanders, scholten and iowa secretary of state candidate deidre dejear headed to the school's sports complex to shoot some hoops for the cameras.
what if trump cuts off medicare? what if he cuts off food stamps?
that's not how immigration enforcement works, she said.
there is a good healthy skepticism with most people, said cpac's organizer, matt schlapp. conservatives have felt like they've taken the bait before. ... voters get told, 'oh yeah. we will do this.' and then they get into power and sometimes don't do so much because those issues are controversial. the one thing about donald trump is what he's showing conservatives, is that he doesn't seem to care that much if something is controversial. if it is something he said he was going to do, he is a bulldog about getting it done.
regardless of what happens now, health care is likely to remain a subject of controversy.
sanders, who sermonizes about u.s. politics in stark moral terms, remains most comfortable expounding on economic policy. it is a tendency that has elicited criticism from some liberals eager to hear him address systemic racial justice and entrenched sexism in more explicit terms.
if the republican plaintiffs win ― an outcome made more likely by the death of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg last week ― an estimated 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and everyone with a preexisting condition, no matter how minor, would be at risk.
while it seems that every candidate — including president trump — is vowing these days to protect people with preexisting conditions, you can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true, larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation, wrote recently.
it's also not a substitute for the hundreds of billions of dollars that the affordable care act spends every year on private insurance subsidies and expanded medicaid ― which, in turn, has improved financial security, access to care and health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of michiganders.
what remains intact are deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, the two most popular among american taxpayers. touching these deductions would most likely hurt the housing market and home values, and non-profit organizations relying on donations to survive.
but for republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.
after iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser michael flynn went before the white house press corps to deliver a bellicose response. but just hours later, top national security council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the united states would continue to comply as well.
while some gop convention speakers stirred fear over crime and rioting, others, such as sen. tom cotton of arkansas and trump himself, framed a win for biden as tantamount to selling the country out to china.
some states will keep working to expand coverage to the uninsured and keep it affordable and adequate, [and] in other states we'll see a race to deregulate, with the result that comprehensive coverage will be more expensive for those who need it most, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university, said.
meanwhile, at the spanish catholic center, which is run by catholic charities, aguirre said, they're seeing kids go hungry.
the washington post via getty images seema verma, the trump administration official who oversees federal health programs, says monday's rule change will give states more flexibility. the question is how much flexibility, whether it's consistent with the law and ultimately how it would affect consumers.
inside the sliding-glass doors of the hotel, others were similarly passionate. kira innis, 30, of los angeles, who claimed to have wanted trump to run for president since she was 13, said the only thing that would force her to question her support would be if trump sanded down his infamously rough edges.
these attacks were especially galling to reform proponents because it was the opposite of what they were trying to do.
some of that is due to polarization, with obamacare popular among democratic voters and unpopular among republicans for reasons that probably have little to do with anything but partisan loyalty. but performance is still an issue. many millions still can't pay their medical bills, because they don't have insurance or their insurance covers too little. the u.s. still has the world's most confusing and expensive system, with little evidence that the extra money buys better quality.
president donald trump really, really wants to fool voters into thinking he has a plan to make the health care system great again. but he really, really doesn't.
president joe biden is set to begin his own victory lap this week, first by signing the law in a ceremony on thursday and then by delivering a prime-time speech on the anniversary of the nation's covid-19 shutdown. the white house is already promising biden, vice president kamala harris and both of their spouses will hit the road to sell the plan nationally.
continuing, he mockingly imagined the conversation of a fictional couple excited to pay their monthly insurance premium: oh my god, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day! oh, wow!
like stimulus ― what does that even mean to people? psaki said, reflecting on how democrats sold the 2009 bill.
health care remains the no. 1 issue for voters, according to public opinion polling, and republicans remain on the defensive following a democratic midterm romp.
that means the mandate is an unconstitutional command, according to the lawsuit. and because the law's component parts are so interconnected, the lawsuit says, the whole thing has to come off the books.
the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates the new proposal would cause 14 million people to lose health insurance next year and 24 million by 2026. the bill has divided house and senate republicans and sparked fierce criticism from democrats and leading medical and hospital groups, including the american medical association and american hospital association. (graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2n0zmkf)
states have always had some flexibility to request these sorts of waivers, of course. but when the obama administration was in charge, it set clear limits on state action. to get waiver approval, states had to demonstrate that residents wouldn't end up with worse coverage as a result.
permanent spoiler alert: we simply can't imagine anyone other than donald j. trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. but we won't get tired of him winning. believe me.
there is a heated debate right now about what is this best way forward, adam gaffney, the president of physicians for a national health program told huffpost. medicare for all is one proposal. medicare for all is the best proposal. is someone going to make that case?
a proposal designed to stabilize obamacare and reduce health insurance premiums for some americans seems unlikely to become law anytime soon.
season six is thrilling beyond measure. the show is going out in a blaze of glory. i had to take valium midway during last sunday's episode because i thought i'd never get to sleep after the non-stop excitement.
between the loss of tax credits and the end of medicaid funding, 21 million people would lose insurance, according to estimates by the nonpartisan urban institute.
correction: a previous version of this story said first lady melania trump attended the service. she did not.
is it a farce? it probably is, but no one wants to say that, this person said, on the condition of anonymity.
i'm more worried than i have been since it was originally [put in place], said gail kaplan-wassell, a maryland resident who came to the supreme court tuesday to join a protest in favor of reproductive rights. kaplan-wassell said that as a college student in massachusetts in the 1970s, she had also come to the national mall to advocate for abortion rights.
there were no criteria and no limits on who could testify, connelly said.
the reality, of course, is far more complicated. and it was readily apparent at this week's conservative political action conference. the gathering of students, activists and operatives featured a number of die-hard trump supporters, including those able to rationalize a principled support of the president, even after such a hypothetical shooting.
sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.), one of the most vulnerable gop incumbents facing reelection, introduced one such measure this year, allowing him to say he stands with trump on obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
you know what solves it? trump asked, referring to obamacare. when the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster — then you'll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.
that, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.
if the administration takes such action, it's likely that fewer people would pay a financial penalty for not having health insurance, but people who hold onto their coverage would face higher premiums. in addition, the number of people without coverage would rise, maybe even dramatically.
despite biden's strength at the grassroots level among black voters, groups that represent black activists and other minorities haven't lined up behind him. the florida-based racial justice group dream defenders endorsed sanders, as did center for popular democracy action, a network of progressive community organizers looking to mobilize black and latinx voters. the center for urban and racial equity gave biden an f rating on its 2020 scorecard, saying the most of biden's plans do not explicitly mention race or racial inequity.
the other campaigns know what they are up against.
i think what we got wrong was underestimating ... the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled. former president barack obama
trump also took aim at democratic presidential nominee joe biden's health care plan ― or a caricature of it, anyway.
but he also expressed empathy for those frightened by a dramatic change in the system, encouraging them to see themselves in the traditions of presidents harry truman, john f. kennedy and lyndon johnson, all of whom sought to expand health care coverage against the wishes of the private health care industry.
taxes were a key item in donald trump's presidential agenda. he and his advisors feel that revision of the nation's tax code will spur economic growth and, besides changing healthcare policy, be a hallmark of his presidency. however, his proposed tax policy will benefit businesses and the wealthy, while hurting the middle class, the poor, and ballooning the federal budget deficit and the national debt.
as the trump administration has stepped up deportations and workplace raids around the country, there's been a drop at the spanish catholic center in all immigrants applying for food stamps, said case manager rodrigo aguirre. many fill in the gaps by picking up bags of donated groceries from the center's food pantry.
women are becoming the most powerful political force in america, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020. cecile richards, supermajority co-founder
sanders went on to suggest that those who did not reject that money should have to explain why the health care industry sees their candidacy as a good investment.
aol trump's former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the iran deal. but administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like john bolton and mike pompeo aboard.
ahead of a political rally last saturday, there were signs that the state remained unwelcoming terrain for sanders. two of the state's veteran democratic officials carped in the press that he should get lost, arguing that the visit was unhelpful in a conservative state where the party's candidates usually compete by tacking to the center.
in his rollout of a health care plan on monday that would create a public option for people to buy into medicare, biden described medicare for all as both an attack on the affordable care act, or obamacare, and traditional medicare.
but this week secretary of defense mattis joined the trump administration's attack on civil rights, and particularly lgbtq rights, delaying for six months a pentagon plan approved in the obama administration to permit transgender recruits to enlist in the military. mattis said the plan would give the defense department more time to study the issue, and insisted that the delay in no way presupposes the outcome of review, but lgbtq advocates noted that the obama order was issued a full year ago, giving the military branches sufficient time to address concerns, and conservative groups cheered the decision and expressed hope the obama decision would be cancelled. the order already prohibited the armed forces from kicking out existing service members for coming out as transgender, and there's been no showing of national security danger from allowing transgender americans to serve openly. blocking basic anti-discrimination protections for people who want to serve their country, just as the pentagon previously did with gays and lesbians, is plain wrong.
the affordable care act strengthened medicaid by funding new home-based care options for the disabled and elderly. these initiatives would lose their authorization, leaving decisions about whether to continue the programs in the hands of cash-strapped state officials.
many insurers suffered significant financial losses during the first few years of the program, because they attracted fewer healthier customers than they anticipated. this year, those carriers responded with larger-than-usual premium increases and, in some places, by withdrawing offerings altogether.
in 1994, she claimed that hillary clinton's health care reform plan would bar people from purchasing care outside the new clinton system, which would cruelly ration treatments to curb costs. it wasn't true. the magazine that published the article would later disavow it.
trump is right in noting that there was no bipartisan appetite for his health care proposal. and certainly, when you start without any support from the other side of the aisle, it is hard to pass much of anything.
but, she's 99% committed to biden.
the proposal, she said, would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years people in medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner.
in the end, however, the effort was for naught. leaders couldn't come up with language that would draw enough votes from the two holdout gop factions to overcome the unified opposition of democrats.
polls have shown repeatedly that medicare for all's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether.
this also does not take into account all the kinds of assistance navigators provide all year, such as helping with complex cases and issues and filing appeals. florida will definitely be hit hard by this.
scott huffmon, a pollster with winthrop university in south carolina, emphasizes the importance of trust among black voters in south carolina.
many republicans still aren't willing to vote for any proposal that might appear to prop up obamacare, otherwise known as the affordable care act, which they and many of their supporters would rather just repeal.
shutting down the law would mean shutting down the center and its programs, with unknown consequences for the health care providers participating in them.
republicans' ideas are unpopular. their president is historically unpopular. their failed effort to repeal the affordable care act and their deliberate mismanagement and weakening of the law's benefits are unpopular. they are under sustained assault from democrats highlighting (and mostly accurately describing) the gop health policy agenda, especially on the question of people with pre-existing conditions. and most americans are inclined to side with democrats on this issue.
the problem for advocates of medicare for all isn't simply the republicans in the senate, who have called it socialism and pledged to fight it tooth and nail. a number of more conservative and centrist-minded democratic senators remain uncomfortable with the idea, preferring instead more immediate measures that would bolster the insurance market under obamacare.
still, after huffpost asked those questions about a potential lack of medicare for all voices on the panel, the rules committee tweeted the video of nahvi making the case for single-payer health care.
the iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based republican party, which no longer exists, tyler said. trump's supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way. it's basically: 'whatever trump says goes, and that's fine with us.'
he concluded his remarks on an optimistic note, citing americans' long history of overcoming prejudice and hatred.
another orangeburg resident, mary hampton, 58, said that she can trust biden for standing strong with obama.
unless that changes, the outcome will depend on the supreme court, where nothing is guaranteed.
at bethlehem baptist church, and later at the oyster fry in orangeburg, biden's remarks only touched on one policy issue: criminal justice reform. notably, his platform is an attempt to backtrack his legacy on the issue. he said he would end mandatory minimum sentencing, and expunge criminal records stemming from marijuana convictions.
at the same time, the white house largely moved on to other things after passing the stimulus legislation. the conversation in congress turned to the health care reform effort that would eventually become obamacare. and while economists broadly came to realize that even the then-unprecedented $787 billion stimulus law wasn't enough to jump-start the economy, unified republican opposition and defections from conservative democrats prevented the white house from passing a second piece of legislation aimed at creating jobs.
harris' plan takes a middle-of-road approach, falling short of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) sweeping plan to completely overhaul the nation's health insurance system, yet offering a bigger transformation to the nation's health care system than the reforms supported by former vice president joe biden.
but mccaughey's claim fit the broader narrative about health care reform that the right was constructing ― namely, that the proposed legislation would limit care for the medically vulnerable. soon sarah palin, the former alaska governor and 2008 gop vice presidential candidate, made her own version of the argument.
this is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation i've seen in the senate, senate minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said wednesday. the american people need to learn more about what's in it.
i'm going home to do my research, she said after biden spoke.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) and many republicans have pushed back against the need for additional stimulus during the pandemic, saying they see no urgency in passing a fifth relief package. but among the ideas republicans have put forward, like expanding the ppp program, implementing tax credits for hiring workers or bonuses for rehired workers, health care has largely been left out of the emergency relief debate.
but it's what the bill doesn't say that makes the above mostly meaningless.
the court's 7-2 vote struck a blow against the birth control mandate, a hotly litigated regulation under the affordable care act that requires most private health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without a copay.
overall, however, the mood was notably more subdued than past gatherings. after eight years out of power in the white house, attendees seemed thrilled to have finally reached the mountaintop. but, as even the organizers conceded, they still didn't know what to make of the sherpa.
after eight years of barack obama and tax-and-spend economics, a republican who doesn't do a very good job would have to do a really bad job to anger the movement, said cody leach, of maryland. we have to be a faithful party because we are faithful servants. we have to lead him [trump] to the light.
mcsally, who later lost a senate race for one of arizona's seats before being appointed to the other, now has a different outlook. it's not about government-run health care or about repealing obamacare in its entirety, she said in a campaign video earlier this month. it's about bringing the cost down.

when host george stephanopoulos followed up, asking specifically whether trump intended to stop enforcing that mandate, conway responded, he may.
medicare for all is one proposal. medicare for all is the best proposal. is someone going to make that case? adam gaffney, president of physicians for a national health program
the democrats today have one advantage, though. they can learn from the past. and when i asked obama to reflect on what he and the affordable care act's architects got wrong, he cited a failure to grasp the depth and duration of gop opposition. i think what we got wrong was underestimating the degree to which political polarization had ― the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled, the former president said, adding later, i think any progressive president, on any issue for the next several years, is going to have to confront the problem that the gop has shifted into a perpetual campaign mode.
the truth is that, like in so many other areas, trump doesn't want to do the work. after all, as trump once said, health care is complicated! who needs the headache when there are people of color to insult and golf to play?
the debut of this phony bill friday is the latest installment in republicans' long-running campaign to make the health care system worse for anyone who has ever been sick while loudly proclaiming they are doing the opposite.
sanders' rivals in the democratic primary are already in compliance with key elements of his pledge. all 24 democratic candidates have rejected corporate pac money of all kinds; 14 of them, including the leaders in the polls, have also renounced contributions from federal lobbyists.
president donald trump has continuously touted his plan to repeal and replace the affordable care act. he has yet to put forth any legitimate legislation to take its place, despite his repeated attacks to repeal obamacare.
president donald trump's justice department decided not to defend the law in court, which is not the normal way the department handles cases challenging federal laws. the administration, however, doesn't want to throw out the whole law ― just the parts that protect people with pre-existing conditions. some democratic state officials have stepped to take the federal government's place and fight the lawsuit.
welcome to the 2020 democratic presidential primary. in a warm-up for an anticipated second run by sanders, he's been promoting the party's prospects in the nov. 6 elections during a nine-state campaign swing that began in bloomington, indiana, on oct. 19 and wraps up in oakland, california, this saturday. he'll be joined on that last stop by rep. barbara lee of california, a fellow progressive stalwart running for chair of the house democratic caucus.
but some researchers at california food policy advocates, a nonprofit based in oakland, caution against drawing a conclusion between the implementation of the secure communities program and the drop-off in food stamp enrollment.
whether the upsides of the alexander-collins package justify its downsides has been the subject of increasingly intense debate among democrats and progressive analysts in the last few weeks. families usa, a liberal organization and prominent advocate for coverage expansions, actually came out in opposition to the bill.
house republican leaders on friday pulled their bill to repeal the affordable care act, signaling defeat on what was supposed to be a major legislative accomplishment for president donald trump.
no one will be safe in biden's america, trump said in the closest thing the 70-minute speech had to a summary.
as trump navigates his first year in office, his challenge will be keeping these types of voters in the fold as he confronts the tough realities of actual governance. a border wall won't be built quickly, and the repeal of obamacare may never occur. the question is whether workman, edward and many others can forgive a lack of progress as quickly as they forgive trump's idiosyncratic politics.
but none of that would compare to knocking out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as this new lawsuit could do.
still, anxiety remains, even in sanctuary cities. earlier this year, reuters reported the trump administration was considering making it harder for immigrants to get a green card if they or their u.s.-born children used public assistance programs such as food stamps. advocates say that sent many immigrants into a panic.
at the moment, a federal judge in texas is considering a lawsuit against the affordable care act that gop officials in 20 states launched. the trump administration, rather than defending the federal law as administrations normally do in such circumstances, filed a brief in support of the plaintiff's claim about the law's constitutionality.
i was never really a repeal-and-replace guy. i wanted to fix things, sen. david perdue (r-ga.), who voted to repeal obamacare in 2017, told huffpost. like other republicans, perdue views obamacare as fundamentally broken, calling it a disaster. but he, too, talked up the need to maintain some of its core elements.
denver health medical center, for example, opened a new $26.9 million clinic in the city's southwest in 2016 to provide care to an area lacking in health services and saw more patients within six months than it had expected over two years. the health system planned to build or remodel five more facilities based on the new clinic's success.
the bill would have ended obamacare's expansion of medicaid eligibility and cut funding for the rest of the medicaid program going forward. it would have scaled back regulations on what insurance covers. it also would have redistributed financial assistance, so that people with lower incomes and higher insurance costs would get less than they do today ― even as more affluent people would qualify for substantial new subsidies.
the fact that they haven't been able to come up with something, obama said, indicates either bad faith on their part or the fact that we were pretty thorough and looking at all the options and we arrived at what was the most realistic way to deliver universal health coverage.
we can't even pay for medicare for some. we need to solidify that. we need to fix the affordable care act, sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.) said tuesday when asked about medicare for all.
democrats believe the gop's aggressive push for these sorts of laws may backfire, just as their yearslong campaign to repeal the affordable care act did in the 2018 elections.
it's almost impossible to wrap your brain around how this would actually work, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university, told huffpost. it's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not.
it's gotta be replaced, tillis said of obamacare last week, before brushing off the coming onslaught of health care ads against him in 2020. the north carolina republican warned democrats and their allies planning on taking him on that they would do so at their own peril because the fact of the matter is the affordable care act is not popular.
and if trump was woefully ill-informed about the iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. rather, they tracked congressional republicans' attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the gop nomination, which were then further escalated by fox news hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.
the mandate has been credited with significantly reducing birth control costs across the country. before the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, contraceptives made up about 30% of women's total out-of-pocket health care costs, according to the national women's law center. in 2013, the mandate saved women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills.
the situation is a loss for healthcare workers, a loss for most consumers, and a loss (allegedly) for aetna, blue shield and most other insurance companies who are threatening to leave the exchanges because they are no longer earning enough money. hey, nobody is intentionally trying to sabotage obamacare and make the first black president look bad - right?
under the judgment, between 70,500 and 126,400 women could lose access to no-cost birth control, according to government estimates.
correction: a previous version of this article called pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend, indiana. he is still the mayor.
but since november's election, when republicans swept the white house and congress, denver health has deferred $73.7 million-worth of construction projects that had been planned to serve more low-income residents, many of whom were newly insured under obamacare.
what i did not see, for example, was republican governors refusing [federal] medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people.
legal reasoning is always subjective, but even lawyers who enthusiastically supported other lawsuits challenging the affordable care act's constitutionality have dismissed the case as nonsense.
the awareness of structural problems in american politics, starting with the senate, already feels stronger than it did a year ago, when obama said all of these things to me. and the approach democrats are taking to their covid-19 relief bill suggests they are learning to adapt. party leaders decided early on to use budget reconciliation, so they can pass something with 50 votes in the senate; republican support would be nice, they said, but they're not going to hold up legislation for it.
if the democrats want a nominee who is a democrat, a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, then join us, the former vice president said to roaring applause.
three years ago, when i was in south carolina and other states campaigning, my opponent and editorial writers all across the country ... they said, 'bernie sanders is nuts. he is far out. his ideas are extreme. nobody supports those wild ideas,' he said with a mock sense of alarm. well, guess what happened folks? three years have come and gone, and those ideas that were seen to be radical and extreme three years ago are today mainstream, supported by the vast majority of america.
for a lot of years, the threat against women's health care has been talked about, but they've never been as real as they are today, said jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist who works on health care. it's changed from a coffee table conversation to a clear and present danger. that means voters can no longer stay with republicans and assume that this won't become an issue.
the [democratic] party is pushing a socialist nightmare. their plans will result in rationing care, denying choice, putting americans on waitlist, driving the best doctors out of medicine permanently and delaying cures, trump said.
insistence upon these abortion restrictions undoubtedly reflects genuine policy preferences from conservatives. it also reflects a political calculation ― namely, that republicans can't afford to alienate supporters who are strongly opposed to abortion, obamacare, or both.
that fear comes at a price, said co-author marcella alsan, associate professor of medicine at the stanford school of medicine. for immigrant families struggling to get by, the drop in food stamp use, she said, could have a long-term effect on their health and their mobility out of poverty.
they are allowing insurers to sell more so-called short-term policies, which insurers can refuse to sell to people with pre-existing conditions. they want to permit states to set aside the aca's insurance regulations and set up new markets for policies that people with pre-existing conditions can't buy. at the state level, iowa and tennessee already have parallel insurance markets that allow insurers to turn away people with pre-existing conditions, and idaho wants to join them.
with obamacare repeal off the legislative agenda ― for now, at least ― why would these senators write legislation to solve a problem that doesn't exist? because their party is the middle of unsolving it.
the affordable care act originally had a reinsurance program that expired after three years. the alexander-collins proposal would start it up again, for another three years, reducing premiums by 10 percent on average in 2019 and by 20 percent on average in the two years after that, according to an estimate from the congressional budget office.
not so long ago, i got to interview an expert on the matter: president obama himself.
this article has been updated with amash's comments.
although the success of this approach has yet to manifest itself in the polls, harris, in particular, has provided sanders ample fodder to distinguish himself as a more genuine champion of single-payer health care.
unsurprisingly, it immediately received flak from both sanders' and biden's campaigns, who criticized it for going too far, and not far enough.
the american health care act would have cut medicaid's budget by $834 billion, causing 14 million people to lose coverage. the cassidy-graham bill also sought to slash medicaid. those bills didn't become law, but not for want of republicans trying. the senate measure failed by a single vote (given that vice president mike pence would've cast a tie-breaking vote in the event of a 50-50 tally).
in the end, exit polls found 89% of 2010 midterm voters said the economy was in bad shape, and 41% said their family's financial situation was worse than it had been two years ago, compared to just 14% who said their financial situation had improved. republicans gained six seats in the senate and took control of the house, picking up a whopping 63 seats.
the pew charitable trusts marchers this month at a rally in washington, d.c., protesting the arrests of immigrants by immigration and customs enforcement. advocates say stepped-up immigration enforcement has contributed to a climate of fear in the immigrant community. many eligible immigrants, they say, are choosing to forgo food stamps, even though they are entitled to receive them.

joe biden aided and abetted china's rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers, cotton said.
the conversation with obama, inside an office building not far from the white house, lasted for nearly an hour. he looked more relaxed than i'd ever seen him. he was wearing a black, open-collar shirt, casual dark gray pants and loafers ― and, as he gleefully pointed out, no socks. the best part of not being president anymore, he said of his attire. but he talked like he always did, with that deliberate, professorial cadence and sentences full of dependent clauses in order to capture every last nuance.
right there in the text, it says health insurance companies would not be allowed to deny an individual coverage or charge extra because of health status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, [or] any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the secretary [of health and human services].
to celebrate our nation, republic report planned to take an independence day break from trump team disgracefulness power rankings, but by sunday morning, when rock 'em sock 'em potus tried to knock cnn's block off, we were so deep into another week of trump team disgracefulness that we had to punch through.
there are four people testifying for democrats: sara collins from the nonpartisan commonwealth fund; dr. doris browne, the former president of the national medical association; dr. farzon nahvi, an emergency physician and professor in new york city; and dean baker, the co-founder of the center for economic and policy research.
whether she's weighed the ups and downs of the law appropriately, whether her sometimes vague proposals would improve access to health care at a reasonable price ― these are subjective questions, about which reasonable people can disagree. but the facts she cited on sunday night were correct, and she's outlined her policy plans clearly, if not always with much detail.
fun fact: obamacare, better known as the law, already does that. — rose benson (@notoriousrbf) august 8, 2020
columbia, s.c. — on the eve of martin luther king jr. day, joe biden went to church in barack obama country.
brendan smialowski/getty images president donald trump delivered a nomination acceptance speech on thursday designed to paint him as a moderate and democrats as radicals. it was one of his many lies.
it's hard to draw a direct cause and effect, call said. they don't ask you why you're disenrolling.
when you get no votes from the other side ― meaning the democrats ― it is a very difficult situation, he said elsewhere.
nextgen america, which is funded by former presidential candidate and billionaire investor tom steyer, will officially endorse biden on wednesday and has reserved the digital ad buy to reach voters younger than 35. the group's decision to back biden isn't surprising; it had already announced plans to spend more than $40 million targeting trump and key republican-held senate seats this year.
but even as gop presidential candidates lambasted the deal, republican foreign policy leaders on capitol hill understood that an international agreement that put the iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. they passed a law that allowed obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to republicans who believed they needed it.
the plaintiffs insist the entire statute has to go because that is what congress intended. but it was congress, in 2017, that decided to zero out the mandate while fully aware that the rest of the affordable care act would stay in place.
trump also turned a holiday concert that was supposed to salute service members and veterans into a tribute to himself, gloating that the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house, but i'm president and they're not.

but that was in the 1960s. today we are in 2019, sanders concluded. in my view, now is the time, not for tinkering around the edges ... now is the time to do what the american people want us to do, now is the time to pass a medicare for all, single-payer program.
this is always the problem for republicans. making insurance available to everybody typically requires some combination of government spending, taxes and regulations. and these are not things republicans want to do.
voters will have to decide what's more believable: that 10 republican senators are standing up for americans who have pre-existing conditions or that this is a sham being perpetrated by the party that has spent the past two years trying to do the opposite.
today, americans who buy insurance on their own can get tax credits if their income is below four times the poverty line (about $100,000 a year for a family of four). those credits effectively discount premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year. they would be gone if the affordable care act comes off the books, leaving millions to buy coverage on their own without that assistance.
we can have a president who wants 100% clean energy, student debt forgiveness and an assault weapons ban, or we can have a white supremacist who tells americans to drink bleach, said ben wessel, the group's executive director. this election is about young americans and our future, and the choice for us is clear: joe biden is the best candidate for president.

cnn's chris cuomo slammed trump's vow as a dangerous lie.
more than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, meaning millions will be left without health insurance. in mid may, left-leaning think tank economic policy institute estimated 16.2 million people have lost health insurance once provided by their employer — how roughly half of americans get their health insurance. that number could be as high as 26.8 million if those who lost their jobs don't sign up for other coverage, the kaiser family foundation found.

glenn beck, the conservative pundit, made a similar case on his radio show: i would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, said beck, who is 56. i would rather die than kill the country. 'cause it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country.

and not all americans will qualify for medicaid, the public health program for low-income americans.
the proof is in the rhetoric of republicans, who claim to support these goals as much as democrats do, while promising supposedly better alternatives they've never been able to pass as legislation.
washington — it's that time of the week — food pantry day — and before the doors even open at the spanish catholic center, the patrons begin queueing up, lugging roller carts and empty grocery bags, the line stretching out onto the hot sidewalk. immigrants all, they hail from the congo and costa rica, from nicaragua and el salvador, from togo and vietnam. most are seniors.
they may have failed to repeal the law, but they have endeavored to make it harder for people to get coverage. the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a report demonstrating the effects of the sabotage ― and the higher premiums it has created ― just last week: lower enrollment, especially among those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies.
we're now almost 10 years into it, so i deal with the world we're in, and so let's figure out an offramp that addresses some of the underlying issues about the cost of health care while also providing more access to health insurance for people on the individual market that still can't afford health insurance that have preexisting conditions, mcsally said.
almost immediately after obamacare went into effect, rates of uninsured dropped and medicaid coverage jumped to over half of all patients.
comprehensive coverage will be more expensive for those who need it most. sabrina corlette, research professor, georgetown university
democratic candidates running for president are in the middle of a heated debate about health care, one that will only intensify under the glare of television cameras as they take the stage in detroit, michigan, for the second presidential debate this week.
lev raphael is the author of the edith wharton murders and 24 other books of fiction and nonfiction.
the gravest threat to the aca's promise that even people who've been sick can get health insurance is a lawsuit brought by republican officials in alabama, arkansas, arizona, florida, georgia, indiana, kansas, louisiana, maine, mississippi, missouri, nebraska, north dakota, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah, west virginia and wisconsin. the attorneys general in these states, most with the approval of their gop governors, are trying to get the entire affordable care act thrown out on dubious grounds.
a short film of racially diverse residents of new york city's public housing system denounced the incompetence of democratic mayor bill de blasio. one speaker even denounced democrats for putting illegal immigrants before black americans.
washington ― as republicans in 2016 hammered then-president barack obama's nuclear agreement with iran, their party's foreign policy leaders and even many of the gop candidates themselves understood that the deal, while not ideal, was worth keeping.
what did white house national security adviser general mcmaster do? simply, he told reporters, regarding trump's upcoming meeting with russian president vladimir putin, there's no specific agenda — it's really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about. general, you're supposed to be protecting americans, not scaring the fuck out of us.
sponsors of private employer plans, through which roughly half of all americans get insurance, could once again impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, since it's the affordable care act that made such limits illegal. that could really hammer patients with rare forms of cancer or congenital conditions, such as hemophilia, for which treatments can easily exceed $1 million per year or sometimes even per month.
so far, the campaign is playing out a lot like it did in 2018, with republicans insisting, again, that they would never take away protections for people with preexisting conditions. several are running ads featuring family members who fought medical problems, just to prove how serious they are.
trump is part of a lawsuit the supreme court is scheduled to take up in november (after election day, of course) that could eliminate the whole law. this, in fact, is trump's vision for health care reform, not whatever bogus claims he makes to get him out of a political jam he put himself in by joining a legal case originated by a bunch of republican state officeholders.

sen. lamar alexander's office declined to comment on what congress should do on health care, saying they had nothing to add at this time. the tennessee republican is the chairman of the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate. offices for sens. bill cassidy (la.), tim scott (s.c.), lisa murkowski (alaska), mike braun (indiana) and rob portman (ohio), who sit on either the help committee or the senate finance committee, which collectively have purview over obamacare, medicaid and medicare, did not respond to requests for comment.
i think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised when they see the child tax credit and the fact that they will be getting essentially bonus checks to support their family based on how many children they have, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told huffpost. so i think really aggressively messaging the specific tangible aspects of this bill that everyday people can see and feel is what's most important.
food stamp enrollment in the past quarter has fallen by about half from this time last year, aguirre said, even with increased outreach and after the center streamlined its application process.
death panels in the age of coronavirus
democrats say they won't make the same mistake again. while its legislative path remains uncertain, the white house is aiming to pass legislation built around biden's build back better plan ― which could make some of the tax credits and health care subsidies included in rescue act permanent, and also include billions in infrastructure spending ― sometime this spring or summer.
campaign ads attacking president donald trump's administration for trying to sabotage obamacare are already popping up in congressional races.
obamacare is a disaster. you know it. we all know it. it's going up at numbers that nobody's seen worldwide. nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. only gets worse. their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more and more money. we have almost $20 trillion in debt. obamacare will never work. it's very bad. very bad health insurance. far too expensive. and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. one of the biggest line items very shortly.
the generous explanation for these positions is that republicans and their supporters have a principled opposition to government, for reasons that are philosophical, practical or both. the not-so-generous explanation is the suffering of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and meatpacking plant workers, simply doesn't matter that much.
trump's economic team feels that cutting taxes will help the american economy in order to reach their goal of 4 percent gdp growth. but the plan has some potential problems that outweigh the intended benefits.
to put an extra head spin on the whole incident, trump's department of justice argued before the supreme court in june to shut down the aca with its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. it even specifically singled out coverage for preexisting conditions as something that's got to go.
there's a fear of exposing family members, said crystal yang, assistant professor of law at harvard law school, one of the report's authors.
sanders delivered the speech at a tenuous moment in his second presidential bid. his standing has dropped in many national- and state-level polls, putting warren and harris within striking distance of his second-place standing, as all three scramble to overcome the substantial lead biden continues to enjoy.
but, by that point, the politics of health care in michigan was shifting in the same way it was shifting nationwide. voters started to appreciate what the affordable care act, for all of its flaws, had achieved. and they got angry at republicans for trying to take those things away.
lord grantham finally collapsed after endless build-up, but sadly didn't die. everyone on that show looks so very good in black.
as a result, some middle- and upper-income americans are likely to see pretty big premium spikes this fall, above and beyond the usual increases, right before the midterm elections. and they may be looking for somebody to blame.
as attention turns to the 2020 democratic presidential race, the 77-year-old sanders benefits from his surprisingly strong showing in 2016 against clinton, who began that race as the prohibitive favorite. but some party strategists believe a big reason for his success was voter antipathy toward her.
just last week, a report from the congressional budget office predicted that removing the individual mandate but keeping other obamacare provisions, such as the pre-existing condition guarantee, would lead to premiums jumping by 20 to 25 percent within a year, above and beyond current projections.
and priorities usa, the largest democratic super pac, launched the first ads of a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote the biden-harris-democratic agenda. the digital ads, running in the swing states of arizona, florida, georgia, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin, contrast the gop support for the trump-era tax cuts with the party's unified opposition to the covid-19 relief bill.
now there's a new debate, about the effect of covid-19 on public health and the economy ― and how to respond.
more recently, some covid-19 relief measures have extended or built upon part of the affordable care act ― which is yet more proof, as university of connecticut professor john cogan has argued, that congress understood the law would stay in place and supports that.
a super pac funded by one of the democratic party's largest donors is reserving $11 million worth of digital advertising space targeting young voters, hoping that simply pointing them to the basic policy differences between former vice president joe biden and president donald trump will increase their enthusiasm to vote in november.
republicans are even inventing washington post fact-check articles that supposedly called their democratic opponents liars for saying republicans are lying about pre-existing conditions. some gop senators went so far as to introduce fake legislation about pre-existing conditions. it's a lot of lying.
the trump administration guidance means that it can interpret the law's rules more loosely, in ways that will effectively let people move into less comprehensive coverage ― even though that means more exposure to medical bills.
the problem with this argument is that congress last year made a clear decision to keep the protections but toss the mandate. the lawsuit essentially argues that this more recent action doesn't matter.
in subsequent remarks, both trump and ryan indicated they were ready to move on from health care to other issues.
by design, the mandate is sizable: it's either $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of a household's income ― whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family.
as part of the promotional campaign for obama's visit to milwaukee, the white house shared a letter a former opponent sent the president about his experience with the affordable care act.
the case, known as california v. texas, is the third such challenge to reach the high court since the law's 2010 enactment. and the stakes are as high as ever. if the justices wipe out the affordable care act, as 18 republican state officials and the trump administration have asked it to do, roughly 21 million americans could lose health insurance, according to independent projections.
i'd like us to put in place a better program than the one we have, the obamacare program, but getting that in place for the country to take advantage of in the next few weeks is just not very likely, sen. mitt romney (r-utah) said.
trump had actually started talking about obamacare in his opening statement ― when he said that premiums were going up with numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 71 percent. then, after clinton had given her assessment of the law, he continued with the theme:
corporations stand to gain substantially since their tax rate would decrease from 35 to 15 percent. this is considered the most aggressive step in the trump tax plan since the goal is to set the corporate tax rate on par or below that of other industrialized countries and, therefore, become more competitive. the objectives are to bring jobs to american shores, attract foreign capital, and incentivize global companies to establish subsidiaries or relocate to the united states while stimulating long-term economic growth.
surprised? don't be. gingrich's plan to let traditional medicare wither on the vine, as he put in 1996, is more than 20 years old. ryan may be retiring from congress after the upcoming election, but his 2012 plan (and the various versions of it created since then) to slash medicare and replace it with a voucher system remains popular among fellow gop politicians, even though they tend to hide this during election years. or even straight-up lie about it.
perhaps most consequentially, the administration has partially sided with a group of republican state officials seeking to strike down the affordable care act on constitutional grounds.
barrow discovered a weakness in jug-ears and didn't do a happy dance but offered to teach him how to read. we all know where that can lead, don't we? first there's teaching, then there's reading, then there's skimming, then that day we read no further (look it up).
progressives have balked at the idea, calling it a giveaway to private insurance companies and big corporations that run their own health insurance plans. subsidizing cobra would direct federal funds toward private companies that pay higher rates than public programs like medicare and medicaid. other health care proposals that have been championed by progressives in both the house and senate would have medicare cover americans' out-of-pocket medical costs during the pandemic, or allow americans who have filed for unemployment to be eligible for medicare.
clinton gave a nuanced response. the democratic nominee sketched out what she believes are the affordable care act's strengths and weaknesses, vowing to address the latter with a series of modest changes that she'd outlined previously in her speeches and writings.
those fees, he argued, are nothing less than taxes on the middle class.
palin, who has a child with down syndrome, went on to say, the america i know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with down syndrome will have to stand in front of obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. such a system is downright evil.
in addition, the focus on new york city was bizarre. notwithstanding an uptick in crime, including shootings and murders in recent months, new york city does not even break the top 25 most crime-ridden big cities. and though the city is in the grips of an uptick in crime that is cause for local concern, the big apple is on track to have far fewer violent crimes this year than it did under giuliani.
in theory, even the conservatives justices should make quick work of the case.
their protests and efforts to make this into a huge deal is as likely to contribute to fear in the immigrant community as anything else, vaughan said. then, too, she said, the decline in food stamp enrollment could also be attributed to eligible family members leaving to be with loved ones who were deported.
they probably would have looked at it and thought: what's best for the country? he said. i don't know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.
having announced last month that she would launch a lengthy process to rewrite the rules developed under president obama to hold predatory for-profit colleges accountable for ripping off students and taxpayers, secretary devos announced online at 4:20 pm friday before the holiday weekend that she was delaying key parts of one of the rules, called gainful employment. senator dick durbin (d-il) charged, appropriately, that the move would give predatory for-profit schools more time to take advantage of students, bilk taxpayers, and hide information about perpetually poor-performing programs from the public.
confronted sunday morning on abc's this week with a fresh trump tweet that transmitted a video from trump's pro wrestling period, doctored to depict him pummeling a man whose head is a cnn microphone, trump's white house terrorism advisor thomas bossert could have stayed in his lane, pivoting to talk of securing the homeland. hell, he even could have criticized trump's latest incitement to violence and attack on free speech (see 1, below). instead, bossert sucked up to his bellicose boss, insisting, falsely, no one would perceive that as a threat before adding, i hope they don't. then bossert, perhaps hoping trump would applaud the tv appearance rather than throw his golf shoe at the screen, gushed, he's a genuine president expressing himself genuinely.
the supreme court on wednesday upheld rules issued by the trump administration that allow employers with religious or moral objections to deny women access to free birth control coverage.
one sentence could make the case go away
the defendant in the case is the u.s. government, because the affordable care act is a federal law. customarily, the justice department would file a brief arguing why the states are wrong, since it is part of the executive branch and defending federal statutes in court is part of the executive's constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
if campaign season starts up in 2020 and there is no bricks in the [mexico] wall, i would have to say, at that point, 'o.k., what's going on? edward eventually conceded.
this time, activists see a turning point with not just alabama, but with the confirmation of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court, solidifying a 5-4 conservative majority. the threat of the court overturning roe v. wade is suddenly real.
those people are the ones the affordable care act affected most directly. today, they can get comprehensive coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and a majority of them are eligible for federal tax credits that generally keep coverage affordable.
but reconciliation isn't a cure-all for the senate's structural problems, especially given the strict, quirky rules about what provisions can even pass through that process. and at least for the moment, ending or even reforming the filibuster seems to be off the table.
why did aetna agree to a deal that included a $1 billion break-up fee? when the company agreed to this condition, did aetna conduct an internal assessment of the risk of a doj challenge? when aetna agreed to pay this fee, was aetna aware that it would endanger participation in the aca exchanges?
the direct aid, along with additional funding to reopen schools and speed up vaccine distribution, is meant to quickly help americans regardless of their employment status, while the stimulus's extensive funding for state governments and spending on infrastructure projects was explicitly intended to create jobs.
at least that's what the senators say it will do. here's the thing, though: that's bogus.
the south carolina event, organized by the state chapter of our revolution, the group built to carry on the mission of sanders' 2016 campaign, was billed as a medicare for all rally. it was sanders' first trip back to south carolina since the primary battle in '16.
one thing that sanders clearly does not see as an obstacle is his age. though that issue would likely surface, its importance could be diminished if the 75-year-old biden enters the race. and by election day in 2020, trump will be 74.
these numbers have fed the perception that trump is a sui generis type of political figure ― one whose avid base will stick by him regardless of foible or misstep. it's a perception that trump himself has pushed, famously declaring that he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any votes.
the closest thing to what palin was describing was a proposed commission on medicare spending. but it was hardly a death panel. its job was to make broad changes in how the program paid for medical services, not sit in judgment of individual patients or their merits.
photo by samuel corum/getty images president joe biden speaks from the white house following the passage of the american rescue plan in the senate on march 6. the bill passed the house on wednesday and is expected to be signed by biden on thursday.
this is the lowest rate that we have seen since we started keeping these records, obama said. we're not going backwards. we're not going to go back to a time where people could be denied because of pre-existing conditions. that's not who we are. that's who we were.
and in that wzzm interview, james dodged questions for a full 10 minutes while correspondent nick lafave repeatedly (and admirably) tried to get him to offer something, anything, resembling a specific proposal. the most james would say is that he thought more transparency about hospital prices would bring down prices through competition and that i believe the decision-making should go to the people, not the federal government.
1. donald j. trump, president of the united states. last week's ranking: duh
how many enrollees have contacted aetna over its decision to withdraw from the aca exchanges? what materials and resources is aetna making available to assist consumers in selecting new health insurance coverage?
on twitter, physician-author atul gawande said what most analysts listening to trump were probably thinking: i am still trying to decipher what trump proposed as a health policy and i have no idea what he was talking about.
i imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in south carolina in a very different way, mitchell said.
i think the government should pay the doctors instead of putting that money in an insurance company, she said.
the precise effects of those changes on insurance coverage and the federal budget are unknown ― because republican leaders, determined to rush a vote, would not allow time for the cbo to analyze the changes. in fact, it wasn't until late thursday evening that leadership posted the text of the changes.
the states of pennsylvania and new jersey challenged the rules, arguing that they would have to cover the cost of birth control for people who lost coverage.
as huffpost has noted, though, it's a whole lot harder for trump to paint himself as the solution to crime and civil unrest-fueled-rioting when those problems have exploded on his watch. he ran in 2016 on a similar platform; now he is asking for a chance to deliver on a promise he couldn't keep.
9. james mattis, secretary of defense, and h.r. mcmaster, assistant to the president for national security affairs. last week's ranking: ―
an estimated 4 million hispanics aged 18-64 gained coverage, and the share without insurance fell from 41.8 percent to 30.5 percent. among working-age african-american adults, the uninsured rate declined from 22.4 percent to 10.6 percent as 3 million got covered. and the proportion of non-hispanic whites without coverage went down from 14.3 percent to 7 percent as a result of 8.9 million adults between 18 and 64 becoming insured.
that's not a plan. it's a plan to come up with a plan that won't work because the white house can't just order hospitals not to bill people. again, that's why lawmaking exists.
tuesday's oral arguments will offer the first hints of how she and the rest of the justices view this case, although an actual ruling will likely wait several months, maybe even until the spring.
wednesday's decision sent the case back to a lower court. further attempts to block the trump rules may soon follow.
there were two baskets prepared by mrs. patmore. two! and they were big.
sanders campaigned for scholten after scholten reached out to him, according to sanders' staff, which did not comment on finkenauer or axne.
this new, have-it-every-which-way approach pushes the extremely challenging implementation of the medicare for all part of this plan ten years into the future, meaning it would not occur on the watch of even a two-term administration, biden deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield said in a statement. the result? a bernie sanders-lite medicare for all and a refusal to be straight with the american middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.
but the effects of invalidation of the aca would be devastating to our entire health care system, said timothy jost, a law professor emeritus at washington and lee.
i'll be curious to see how the lawyers try to square trump signing this executive order while simultaneously arguing before the supreme court that the affordable care act's protections for pre-existing conditions be annihilated. — steven dennis (@steventdennis) august 8, 2020
if he told the same lies that hillary clinton was caught in ― using a private email server for public business ― i couldn't vote for him then, said andrew pace, 19, of florida, who wore a make america great again hat signed by conservative media provocateur james o'keefe as he walked the hotel halls. but even then, i'd vote for another republican candidate. either that or [rep.] tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii). i love tulsi.
but it's no wonder why trump and many republicans running for office this year would try to make voters see something that's not there and deceive people about what the gop actually wants to do to the u.s. health care system.
sanders argued, as he has before, that the middle class tax increases needed to pay for medicare for all would be more than outweighed by the savings people would earn from the elimination of private health insurance plans' premiums, deductibles and co-payments.
on the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn't that simple. nobody knew that health care could be so complicated, he said in february 2017.
there are difficult trade-offs and ambiguous medical evidence to weigh. but on one side of the argument is a group of people who act as if ― and occasionally even say ― that returning to normality requires tolerating mass deaths among some of society's most vulnerable groups.
but sanders has since taken pains to court black allies, champion policies outside of what are often strictly defined as economic justice issues and incorporate them into his stump speech. he can no longer be fairly depicted as a politician narrowly focused on economic or class issues.
sitting in the front, biden was a newcomer here at bethlehem baptist church. but rev. anthony mccallum, an early endorser of obama's in 2007, had already called him family. on sunday he told his congregation that he sees in biden what he saw in obama, to roaring cheers.
it's time for the navigator program to evolve, seema verma, the cms administrator, said in a press release that cited the success of commercial brokers in enrolling individuals and stressed the importance of spending federal funds more judiciously.
during the debate, clinton made the same argument she's made so many times before ― that the pluses of obamacare far outweigh the minuses, so the best next step is to fix the law's shortcomings. and although she ran out of time to describe these steps in detail, she has said previously she would focus on reducing the cost of prescription drugs and providing more financial assistance to people with particularly onerous premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey (r), one of the officials who brought the lawsuit, is running for senate — which the state's sen. joe manchin (d) never tires of bringing up. likewise, sen. claire mccaskill (d-mo.) also is more than happy to talk about how her opponent, state attorney general josh hawley (r), also one of the leaders in that case.
the energy on the left was on display tuesday, as activists turned out around the country ― more than 500 events were planned ― for a national day of action to support women's reproductive rights.
of those four witnesses, perhaps only nahvi is actually an advocate for medicare for all, the single-payer health care system that would transition everyone to medicare. and even then, sources tell huffpost that nahvi's testimony is supposed to be limited to how patient experience would change. that means that when the rules committee convenes this hearing on tuesday, there may not be any witness testifying who will make the case for medicare for all over other health care plans.
check out what trump had to say about disaster and making america great on fox news at the 2:00 mark in the video above.
we have a legacy system that is one-sixth of the economy, obama said. the idea that you could, in some way, dismantle that entire system ― or even transition it entirely ― to a single payer system looked politically impractical and probably really disruptive. ... the best chance to actually get people healthier was going to be to design a system that acknowledged 85% of the american people have health insurance and that plugged the gap for those 15% who don't.
the brief was entirely consistent with president donald trump's long-standing hostility to the law, which president barack obama signed in 2010. trump and his republican allies in congress spent much of last year trying to repeal it.
as always, vp pence makes the list for his rapturous gazes at trump at every meaningless white house meeting and ceremony, and for generally working to validate this disgraceful president. and for not immediately defending his wife karen pence's honor when trump told a july 4 white house gathering that he had never before heard the term second lady but that mrs. pence is some lady, that i can tell you.
the basis for the lawsuit is the affordable care act's individual mandate. as originally written, the health care law imposed a financial penalty on people who could get insurance but did not.
palin was and remains a beloved figure to many parents with special needs children. but her claim about the health care legislation was as off-base as mccaughey's.
more conservative members, led by the house freedom caucus, were angry that the bill left some of the affordable care act's insurance regulations in place. those regulations, they suggested, would keep premiums from falling further ― although the precise relationship between each of these regulations and actual premiums is murky.
aaron ontiveroz via getty images attorney general jeff sessions' department of justice is not going to defend the affordable care act's pre-existing condition rule in a lawsuit brought by 20 states.
jayapal continued that she had worked closely with mcgovern, who is a medicare for all advocate himself, and said she was grateful for his leadership.
the less generous plans that verma and the trump administration are touting, and that monday's rule change will favor, frequently leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs if they get seriously sick or injured, precisely because they leave out benefits that people need when they have serious medical problems. often, the buyers of these plans aren't even aware of the limits until it's too late, because deciphering the fine print of these plans is so difficult.
in an interview aboard his district-traversing rv sioux city sue, scholten dismissed the idea that sanders' left-wing policies might be a political liability in his district.
while republicans won back the house in 2010 with a message focused, at least in part, on outrage over wasteful government spending, it's unclear if that message will work as well with the party's culture war-focused trump-era coalition, which includes more voters without a college degree. (the pew survey found lower-income republicans were more likely to support the rescue act then their wealthier counterparts were.)
talking about his starter home, obama told me, it's been vandalized. and people at times tried to undermine its foundations. but it's held up. he's right, and now the biden administration may even have a chance to do some of the repair work obama never could, starting with extra funding for subsidies that is already in the democratic covid-19 relief bill.
but even with the fierce sniping about medicare for all, which has become a litmus test in the 2020 race for the democratic nomination, the candidates have yet to explain how any version of the proposal would pass in a sharply divided senate ― even if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) finds himself the minority leader once again.
if the supreme court strikes down the law, those protections disappear. but such a ruling would do much more.
the law gives the department of health and human services broad discretion to grant hardship exemptions to people who say they can't afford the mandate. there are signs that the trump administration intends to use that leeway to minimize the penalty's impact, in ways that go beyond what the obama administration did.
ever since it passed in 2010, republicans promised to repeal president barack obama's health care law. when donald trump won the white house and republicans won control of both chambers of congress in 2016, they finally had their chance. voters, however, started to realize what would be lost if the law were repealed, and obamacare suddenly became significantly more popular. activists mobilized to protest vulnerable gop lawmakers who had supported repeal, and health care was a top issue energizing democratic voters.
instead of blaming president obama and the democrats or thinking that misplaced risks and inaccurate enrollment predictions are the problem, maybe some of those ceos earning $10-$15 million dollars per year should stop whining about not making enough profits and start finding ways to help fellow human beings survive and thrive... maybe even human beings who aren't white.
in keeping with sanders' base-centric approach to turning his campaign's tide, he stuck to his standard populist script on wednesday, mixing moral denunciations of corporate greed with snarky asides and paeans to the social democratic reforms of the mid-20th century. he insisted that the current health care system, in which millions of americans go without the care they need as insurance executives earn multimillion-dollar compensation packages, is the result of corporate capture of the political system.
so in that context, it makes sense that these senators would want to have a bill they can cite as evidence that they don't think people with pre-existing conditions should be excluded from the health care system. the legislation doesn't actually do that, but it's enough for a campaign ad.
the affordable care act is responsible for historic progress, bringing the number of uninsured americans to a record low, thereby improving access to care and bolstering financial security. but millions of people are unhappy with their coverage, and in some states, newly regulated insurance markets have struggled ― with premiums rising even higher and insurers, stung by financial losses, pulling up stakes.
in his speech on wednesday, sanders focused on debunking arguments put forward by biden and other centrist politicians and think tanks who have warned against a plan that forces people to give up the private health insurance they have in favor of something unknown.
the campaigns of former vice president joe biden, sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg, and former rep. beto o'rourke (d-texas) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
that will be the distillation of our message to the american people in the coming weeks, that help is here for them and their families, jennifer o'malley dillon, the white house deputy chief of staff who served as biden's campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staffers. and we're going to carry that message to every corner of our country through travel, local press, and direct engagement in communities with the president, the vice president, the first lady, the second gentleman, cabinet members, and top officials from throughout the administration.
the bill would have made some other major changes, as well ― such as ending the individual mandate, the unpopular financial penalty for people who do not get health insurance, and rolling back new taxes on the wealthy and health care companies that the government uses to finance the law's coverage expansion.

what is the price of a human life, mister ip? if your son or daughter needed a million dollars worth of brain surgery this week to survive, i am sure you could pass the hat around to your fellow white co-workers at the wall street journal and raise your $12,000 deductible or maximum out-of-pocket costs, but could the average minority in america do the same?
it was an energetic speech from biden, who has been dinged on the campaign trail for an apparent inability to spur the same enthusiasm and movement-style politics as sanders. the senator won the popular vote in iowa, the new hampshire primary and had a blowout victory in the nevada caucuses.

later trump suggested that clinton's solution, providing more financial assistance to people with higher expenses, was a bad idea because the country already has almost $20 trillion in debt. but clinton has called for raising taxes on wealthy americans in order to pay for her new initiatives, including the proposed health care assistance, and the committee for a responsible federal budget ― an independent organization that is obsessive about reducing the deficit ― has concluded she's identified enough specific revenue to pay for nearly her entire agenda.
it could be that three years out we are no longer making money, we are losing money, said himler.
rather than replace the aca and traditional medicare with something less reliable, as biden suggests, sanders' legislation would enroll everyone in an expanded version of medicare that covers vision and dental care, and no longer costs americans anything at the point of service.
the news was so major that it was touted in an official white house tweet.
the news capped a week of chaotic activity at both ends of pennsylvania avenue, as trump, ryan and their lieutenants tried desperately to round up votes for the measure they introduced less than three weeks ago ― which they were attempting to move through the legislative process at breakneck speed.
but since november's elections, much of those plans have been deferred, including a $24 million expansion of a second clinic, largely financed through bonds. the health system still plans to move forward with the construction of one clinic and the remodeling of another. but those plans could be bigger.
congressional republicans spent a good chunk of last year trying to repeal all or most of the affordable care act, for instance, which already dealt with the problems of people with pre-existing conditions being shut out of health coverage or charged exorbitant rates. against all evidence, these lawmakers constantly denied what they were doing, so we've seen this before.
trump decried obamacare as a disaster, giving a hyperbolic account of its flaws with zero acknowledgement of its virtues. then the republican nominee promised he'd give americans the finest health care plan there is, even though he's never sketched out a detailed alternative.
over and over again, gop leaders argued that their proposal represented the party's best chance to kill obamacare. but efforts to corral republicans failed, in part because leaders were dealing with two separate groups with divergent interests.
the mandate was always among the law's most controversial features and was the basis for the first legal challenge, which suggested congress lacked authority to impose such a requirement. the court rejected that lawsuit, with chief justice john roberts leading a 5-4 majority, on the theory that the financial penalty was simply a tax and congress has the power to impose taxes.
to accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. in theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from alexander-collins.
this will be shocking news to biden, who won the democratic primary by opposing the kinds of health care reforms, like medicare for all, that his progressive opponents favored and that also wouldn't do what trump says they would. instead, biden is running on a potentially consequential but also kind of boring plan to make obamacare coverage cheaper.
trump wants to get rid of that obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health care, she said on abc's this week.
but biden now supports tougher enforcement and public investments as part of a buy american program that he says would generate 5 million new manufacturing jobs. and the united states' trade deficit with china ― accompanied by the flight of manufacturing jobs ― has continued to climb during trump's presidency.
democrats are hopeful the trump administration's lawsuit, which a federal appeals court is expected to hear sometime in july, keeps health care front and center in the minds of voters. depending on court rulings and timing, the supreme court could rule on the lawsuit in the summer of 2020, not long before voters head to the polls. democrats also note top republicans have said the party will make another attempt to repeal obamacare, given the chance.
here are three more takeaways from the republican national convention:
i feel like a rabbit in a cage, said marta, 62, who moved to the united states from el salvador 16 years ago, and didn't want her surname used because she is living here illegally. added maria monestel, an 81-year-old babysitter from costa rica, everyone is scared. they think they don't have any rights.
the spending cut is not the only change that cms announced tuesday. going forward, it will encourage navigators to educate consumers about skimpier alternatives to traditional insurance ― including short-term, limited-duration plans that frequently leave out basic benefits, such as prescription drugs, and are unavailable to people with pre-existing conditions.
a new york times/siena poll out monday showed him trailing peters by just 1 percentage point, 42% to 43%. it's only the latest poll to suggest the race is close, even as democratic presidential nominee joe biden has maintained a relatively comfortable lead in michigan.
his appeal has yet to be tested in a field with several strong candidates ― a field that may well include harris along with sens. cory booker (n.j.), elizabeth warren (mass.), kirsten gillibrand (n.y.) and former vice president joe biden.
amid those lies, however, gop officials and candidates have occasionally lapsed and told the truth: the party, like it always has, wants to cut federal health care programs. they want to repeal the affordable care act, still without having any idea how to replace it, and they're working hard to make the law worse in the meantime. they want to slash medicaid. they want to shrink medicare.
and then on sunday, conway got a little more specific.
gop voters remain loyal to the president. and not by small margins. while just 39 percent of all respondents in a recent pew poll said they approved of the job trump was doing, 84 percent of republican and republican-leaning voters said they felt that way. gop support for trump surpasses that for george w. bush, his father, and ronald reagan at similar points in their presidencies.
democrats had just passed a law spending unprecedented amounts of government money to help americans going through an equally unprecedented crisis. republicans almostly unanimously opposed the legislation, but opinion surveys showed a strong majority of the public had favorable views of the plan.
'oh, everything is great, i expected to eat my grandma miles ago, now excuse me i've got to go salt my cousin,' colbert added.
and former new york mayor rudy giuliani ― long hailed by conservative gothamites for his heavy-handed approach to reducing crime in the 1990s ― described de blasio as a taste of the kind of lawlessness-for-its-own-sake that democrats supposedly want to visit on america.
it's up to advocates working with immigrant groups to do all they can to allay the fears of immigrants, vaughan said, to let them know, no one will be deported for receiving food stamps.
early reports have suggested that insurers were expecting better performance this year, thanks in part to the higher premiums. but insurers are already calculating next year's rates and are supposed to finalize them by the spring. if they are not sure the mandate will be fully enforced next year, they could decide on higher premiums or even more exits from state markets.
it's always exciting when national figures localize our issues, he added.
just about the only thing clear right now are the policy stakes. and they are significant.
the super pac has also hired 150 organizers spread across 11 battleground states and is also aiming to register tens of thousands of young voters in 2020. they also created a simple fact sheet they plan to digitally pass out to voters at online organizing events, aiming to answer questions about biden's and trump's records.
it's unclear who decided which experts would testify before the rules committee. staffers on the rules committee say no one in leadership directly told them this person or that person couldn't testify, but sources involved with the planning of the hearing say three criteria were applied to potential witnesses: (1) is this person a leader of a single-payer group? if so, that person could not testify ― meaning gaffney was out. (2) is this person an activist? if so, they couldn't testify. that meant people like dr. sanjeev sriram, who has repeatedly advocated for medicare for all, were ruled out. and (3) has this person said anything negative about the affordable care act?
all of this means the plans come with low premiums. but monday's announcement means that the less generous plans could become cheaper still ― and thus more attractive ― because states would have authority to redirect financial assistance. today, the affordable care act's tax credits are available only to people who buy comprehensive coverage.
another ad similarly paints biden's election as simply a part of the solution rather than a revolutionary act. our generation deserves better, and joe biden can help us get there, the ad's narrator says. we know the fight for progress won't stop after election day, but there are enough of us to start making progress again.
you want a social safety net that gives you things when you lose your job — that's why we have unemployment insurance, miller said. it would be nice if your health side also looked more like that across the u.s.
there's a wait-and-see feeling, said kevin holloran, a senior director at s&p global ratings. hospitals are saying, we'll revisit this in six months or more.
why trump would expect to get democratic votes when he was gunning to gut their primary domestic policy achievement and refusing to talk to them about doing so is not clear. but he clearly felt that it was in their self-interest to have worked with him even though he never asked. speaking to reporters, the president said he expected democrats to now be supportive of reform because they'd have no one else to blame when or if obamacare collapsed.
aaron bernstein / reuters gop sens. john barrasso (wyo.), bill cassidy (la.) and lindsey graham (s.c.) — three sponsors of the new bill — with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) and majority whip john cornyn (texas), after a failed attempt to weaken pre-existing condition protections last year.
the paycheck protection program gives employers loans primarily to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic. collins is part of a bipartisan push advocating an extension of these loans.
one hint to how the supreme court might vote on this case comes from justice brett kavanaugh, who in recent rulings indicated he supports the traditional notion of severability. that might suggest he's inclined to leave the rest of the affordable care act in place, even if he buys the argument that the mandate has now become unconstitutional.
another former colleague told the washington post, which was first to report the resignation, that the news of mcelvain's departure was a gut punch.
ron galella/getty images donald trump, mike tyson and other guests at a charity event in new york city in 1989, the year trump helped whip up public anger against the wrongfully charged central park five.
last year, trump triumphantly signed a huge tax cut bill. the gop line when this legislation was going through congress was that it would pay for itself. it did not. it predictably blew a giant hole in the budget and increased the deficit.
the trump administration is touting this possibility as proof that it is improving choice and affordability ― and, in the words of seema verma, the trump administration official in charge of overseeing federal health programs, that it is working to mitigate the damage of obamacare.
not all hospitals are on hold. some healthcare groups in areas with growing populations, such as atlanta and houston, are pushing ahead with capital expansion projects. others, such as maryland's prince george's county, are still planning to move forward with construction plans, thanks in part to a partnership with the university of maryland medical system.
immigrants must have lived legally in the united states for five years to be eligible to receive snap benefits. a few other immigrant groups — refugees, asylees and the elderly — also are eligible to receive food stamps. undocumented immigrants are not eligible, although many of them work and pay taxes. immigrants living in the united states are twice as likely as u.s. citizens to be poor, despite working at the same rate.
trav robertson, chairman of the south carolina democratic party, criticized party colleagues who blasted sanders for his visit and said he welcomed the visit.
obamacare's problems and two visions for fixing them
the battle could play a key role in determining control of the senate in 2020. mcsally, for instance, is facing a stiff democratic challenge from former astronaut mark kelly, who is married to former rep. gabrielle giffords. democrats need to pick up at least three seats to gain control of congress' upper chamber and have any hope of enacting the party's agenda.
you can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass. and that can't be how any democracy functions over time.
across the industry, hospital jobs so far in 2017 grew by 8,775 monthly on average, compared to 11,413 jobs for the same period last year, bureau of labor statistics data shows. (graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2mtyo0w)
under guidance from the department of health and human services that takes effect immediately but likely won't affect insurance markets for another year, state governments will have new leeway to request waivers from some of the federal health care law's core requirements.
correction: a previous version of this article said the house rules committee had not yet released the names of all the witnesses for the hearing, but it has.
next year, navigators from across the country will have to apply and compete for a total of $10 million in funds. that's down from $37 million for the 2018 plan year and from $63 million for 2017. the trump administration has made similarly sharp reductions in funds earmarked for advertising and promoting health insurance enrollment.
beyond the provisions on pre-existing conditions, if republicans keep control of congress next year, they will come for the affordable care act again. but they still don't have a replacement plan that would protect people with pre-existing conditions or do any of the other things the affordable care act did to slash the rate of uninsured americans.
and that, according to biden, comes down to a race between him and sanders.
the gop votes in 2015, especially in the senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-obama, anti-iran and pro-israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the middle east, said colin kahl, former vice president joe biden's national security adviser.
during the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency, trump had promised not just to repeal the affordable care act, but to replace it with great health care and insurance for everybody. but when the congressional budget office analyzed an early version of the gop proposal, it predicted the number of people without insurance would increase by 24 million over the next decade, going up by 14 million in 2018 alone.
corlette noted that the obama administration insisted that state waivers not hurt certain vulnerable populations, including those with severe medical needs. this is saying that so long as things work out in the aggregate, then it's ok if certain subpopulations are harmed, she said.
we know that there are millions more who are eligible for coverage but haven't gotten it yet, obama said.
requiring navigators to sell junk plans is the same as requiring doctors to offer snake oil ― the whole notion is outrageous, said lori lodes, a former cms official from the obama administration and founder of the organization get covered america.
i strongly doubt he understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement, said richard nephew, a top state department official in charge of iran sanctions during the period the agreement was being negotiated.
spratt truly sounded as if he was about to swallow his own lips when denker turned the tables on him. wouldn't that be amazing--if he got fired, he could join a circus!
obama's focus on republican opposition and its effects may sound self-serving to some people ― whether it's conservatives who blame obama for polarizing the country, or progressives who think obama is trying to avoid blame for compromises he should never have made. reasonable people can certainly question individual decisions that obama, along with other democratic leaders, made at various points in the affordable care act's history.
according to jessica vaughan, director of policy for the center for immigration studies, a washington-based think tank that favors limited immigration, if the decline in snap enrollment is a result of the secure communities program, that could be because of the overreaction among the groups that work with immigrants in the community.
well, it turns out that protection might disappear, along with the rest of the aca, because trump and the republican party want it to.
furthermore, some of the republicans involved in this pre-existing conditions mess are particularly vulnerable.
steel noted that biden's assignment of implementing the recovery act was an implicit admission that job creation wasn't obama's top focus.
the uncertainty has seeped into the municipal bond market, where nonprofit hospitals access capital. the sector sold 36 percent less debt for new projects so far in 2017, compared to the same period last year, while the rest of the municipal market increased the amount of new money issued by 23 percent, thomson reuters data shows. while municipal analysts say it's too early to draw conclusions, the uncertainty surrounding obamacare is a likely cause for the decline.
obamacare has also ended insurance company practices that caused misery for the minority of americans buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers ― practices like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or selling skimpy plans that left out benefits like mental health and rehabilitative services.
verma, who addressed reporters in a conference call monday, insisted that the new rules would not hurt people with pre-existing conditions. in so doing, she echoed claims that trump and countless republican candidates for federal and state office have made with increasing insistence over the past few weeks, as their longstanding support for repealing the affordable care act has become a clear, possibly fatal political liability.
public opinion data suggests why some democrats remain hesitant about embracing an entirely government-run health care program. polls have shown repeatedly that medicare for all's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether. when asked in a henry j. kaiser family foundation health tracking poll to choose between medicare for all and proposals that augment the affordable care act, for example, 36% of democrats chose medicare for all and 57% preferred plans that build upon obamacare.
here's mcconnell again, from a reuters interview: if we had the votes to completely start over, we'd do it. but that depends on what happens in a couple weeks.
the trouble is that those changes also made coverage more expensive, since insurers are now covering people and services they used to avoid. and although millions benefit from tax credits that offset these higher prices, millions do not. they face prices much higher than they expected or feel they should pay ― and one side effect is that many of these people are electing to go without coverage, upsetting the delicate actuarial balance insurers need to cover their costs.
faiz shakir, sanders' campaign manager, also panned the measure.
trump celebrated independence day by visiting a golf course, a trump course, of course, for his 35th time since inauguration day, after saying as a candidate that he would not be playing golf because he would be working all the time.
that's not the case today. today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don't use federal dollars of any kind. in other words, insurers can't use money they've received in the form of premium tax credits. back when csr money was coming in, they couldn't use that money either.
check out the full segment above.
and for all of their bluster, trump and his advisers might be worried about the consequences of weakening the mandate.
but the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions republican leaders have attached to any affordable care act stabilization proposal. and by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.
the affordable care act has its shortcomings and tradeoffs. nobody, not even its staunchest defenders, think it's the ideal response to the problems of america's health care system.
at this point, with biden holding a stable lead and fewer than 70 days until election day, biden wins by not losing.
trump rattled off a litany of policies his administration has implemented or proposed, ranging from relaxing health insurance regulations to attempting to lower drug prices, few of which have amounted to anything.
huffpost asked a number of the leading presidential campaigns whether they were prepared to reject contributions over $200 from executives in the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. the campaign of sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), a fellow proponent of medicare for all, said it would do so.
getty images chief justice john roberts (right) has twice joined more liberal justices to save the affordable care act. but now he would need at least one more conservative to join him, putting the focus on newly confirmed justice amy coney barrett (right).
but at cpac, these types of comments, even from those proudly toting trump paraphernalia, were the minority. most attendees said that while they were uncomfortable with trump's warts, they were able to overlook look them because he was a vessel for their policies.
some of the administration's decisions have actually made it easier for people to buy comprehensive coverage, although by all accounts that was not intentional. in particular, the administration's decision to yank some of the subsidies that insurers get under the law ended up making coverage more affordable for some buyers, because it meant they were eligible for more financial assistance. but the administration has not stopped trying ― and that includes through the courts.
the trump administration is not the first to drop the defense of a federal law. but when past administrations have decided against defending a law, they have generally argued that a case raised highly important moral issues ― or was clearly unconstitutional.
that keeps many from signing up for food stamps and other public assistance even when they're eligible, said monestel, who has lived here for decades as a legal permanent resident.
those findings, which the cbo published early last week, halted the political momentum the repeal legislation had gained when it sailed through two committee votes earlier this month. as trump administration officials and house republicans began preparing for consideration by the full house, they quickly realized the bill lacked enough support to pass.
the timing seemed fortuitous because it was right before the 10-year anniversary of the affordable care act's signing, a milestone he planned to mark by attending a conference and celebration at american university nearby. then the pandemic hit, forcing it to be canceled, which felt somehow appropriate given that the law continues to inspire mixed feelings. approval of the program is higher than in the past, according to polls, but it's still lower than cherished programs like medicare and social security.
i don't even know what i'd tell a health system if they came to me asking what to do, said nicholas bagley, a professor of law at the university of michigan.
i'm not going to vote for him because he and barack are friends, said phyllis pelzer, 53, of orangeburg. a lot of black people see biden as a good guy because he was obama's guy, but i don't care nothing about that. all of em' got some black friends somewhere. you can't win because you have a black friend.
4. stephen bannon, white house chief strategist. last week's ranking: 5
the story with james in michigan is pretty much the same.
sen. john cornyn (r-texas), who has repeatedly voted to repeal the aca, encouraged americans to sign up for obamacare if they lose their health insurance.
mara gandal-powers, senior counsel at the national women's law center, said she was worried about the uncertainty created by the ruling.
our conversation took place in early march 2020, well before anyone knew joe biden would win the nomination and become president this year, or that democrats would also have full control of congress, or that the overwhelming political priority would be dealing with covid-19. and strictly speaking, the interview with obama wasn't about how democrats should govern. the subject was the affordable care act, for a new book about the law's history that is coming out on tuesday.
now its control of the senate in doubt, and the affordable care act is a top issue again, thanks in part to a new lawsuit challenging its constitutionality that the supreme court is expected to hear in november ― quite possibly, with trump nominee amy coney barrett in the seat that justice ruth bader ginsburg once occupied.
again this week, we have almost no idea what bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot.
denver health is not alone. across the country, hospitals are shifting to a more conservative stance as they await sweeping changes to the nation's healthcare law that for the first time in u.s. history would reverse a government healthcare entitlement program. the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, provided coverage to 20 million americans and brought higher revenues to many hospitals.
but again, nahvi's testimony is also supposed to be limited to patient experience, and advocates don't believe he'll be able to make a forceful case for single-payer because of limitations with his expertise.
congressional quarterly via getty images planned parenthood president leana wen spoke outside the supreme court tuesday.
still, it's a response, which is more than james has offered. it is one more reason to treat his promises on health care, like those from so many other republicans, with extreme skepticism.
of course, trump probably had no idea, either.
it's an adorable little bill but does not address any of the main issues, linda blumberg, a fellow at the urban institute, told kaiser health news. you need a package of policies working together in order to create real protections for people to have coverage to meet their health care needs.
when did aetna first determine that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of humana?
but the lawsuit has already gotten favorable rulings from three lower court judges. all three were republican appointees, just like the supreme court majority, which now numbers six conservatives, with amy coney barrett recently placed on the bench.
the outcome of the fight won't be determined solely by messaging: american families will determine if the $1,400 checks and expanded child tax credit included in the plan will help them or not; the schools biden is promising will soon open will either begin allowing students to return or keep their doors shut; the inflation republicans predict will either arrive or it won't.
asked to clarify her position on obamacare last week, mcsally told huffpost she believed the way obamacare did it was not the way to do it. however, she quickly acknowledged the changed politics surrounding the law and its impact on the country's health care system, arguing it ought to be fixed rather than repealed outright.
10. chris christie, trump friend and governor of new jersey. last week's ranking: ―
but this latest regulatory change is a reminder that the gop has never given up on its goal of wiping obamacare off the books, and that people with serious medical problems are likely to suffer as a result.
many more americans would lose medicaid coverage because all but a dozen states have expanded eligibility to include everybody living below or just above the poverty line, providing coverage that's federally funded. that federal funding comes from the affordable care act, and it, too, would stop if the law is no longer in effect.
not that the affordable care act's architects thought they were fixing all of the health care system's problems. after nearly a century of failed attempts at passing universal coverage, most recently during bill clinton's presidency, democrats were determined to find a more politically viable path. by around 2006 or so, a consensus had taken shape around a plan that leaned heavily on private insurance and minimized disruption of existing arrangements, and a strategy that stressed negotiating with the health care industry rather than fighting it.
president donald trump's promised breakthrough in health care coverage looks like it could be insurance protection for preexisting conditions. one sticking point: it's already guaranteed by the affordable care act — which his administration is fighting to kill in the supreme court.
the proposal under discussion now comes from two republican senators, lamar alexander of tennessee and susan collins of maine. its focus is insurance for people who buy coverage on their own, either through healthcare.gov, state exchanges like covered california, or directly from insurers.
what we have found is not that people are so crazy about joe biden. it's that they really love president obama, king said.
but it was all based on nothing. mccaughey's influence enrages actual policy experts who read legislation and accurately dissect the implications of new programs. as the typically measured ezra klein put it in the washington post in 2009: betsy mccaughey is really just a horrible, evil, awful, lying person who wants to make the world worse for people because that's her ticket to increased tv time. there's no other way to put it.
among the many political realities of 2009 frequently forgotten today are that democrats had only 58 senate seats for the first few months, because of litigation over minnesota's close senate race (eventually democrat al franken won the seat) and because pennsylvania sen. arlen specter was still a republican (eventually he switched parties).
whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. trump has already ignored u.s. allies on tariffs and the paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.
i wasn't pining to be on the panel, baker said.
kc mcginnis / reuters sen. kamala harris of california is among other democrats viewed as a presidential contender in 2020.
the affordable care act protects people with preexisting conditions, mostly by prohibiting insurers from denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. it also requires that all plans cover 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs.
sopa images via getty images sen. martha mcsally (r-ariz.) supported full obamacare repeal for years.
harris has repeatedly backtracked on whether she supports the most controversial elements of sanders' plan: forcing americans off of their private insurance and into the expanded medicare program; and raising middle class taxes to finance the new program.
in addition to the cuts in enrollment assistance and advertising for the sign-up periods, trump has cut two important funding streams to health insurance companies, the second of which his administration halted just days ago. the previous decision to cut off billions in payments owed to insurers resulted in significant premium increases for this year, and the latest one could do the same.
these plans typically cover a lot less than the sorts of plans available through the affordable care act. they may have weak coverage of prescriptions, if they have any at all, and leave out mental health altogether. usually they do not cover pre-existing conditions and are often not available to people who have them.
an effect that the numbers don't reveal
there's no way to know whether they accurately reflect what administration officials believe or how they intend to act. and it's anybody's guess as to whether trump has personally settled on a course of action ― or if he even cares enough about policy details to decide on one.
republicans have tried highlighting some specific projects ― they attacked a bridge in upstate new york and funding for a subway system in california as pet projects for house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate majority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) before both items were stripped from the bill for parliamentary reasons ― but have generally made broader critiques, often arguing that only 9% of the bill's spending goes toward covid-19 relief. (that charge is overstated at best, since $1,400 checks make up more than one-fifth of the bill's total spending.)
even as some democratic operatives privately concede republican voters are likely to unite against the bill in the not-so-distant future, they have both messaging and policy reasons to be confident the bill will remain broadly popular.
we don't know what prompted devos to craft this gross misstatement and to implement this wholesale abandonment of protections for students and taxpayers against waste, fraud, and abuse by predatory for-profit colleges. we can only remind you that robert eitel, senior counselor to devos, was, when he joined the department, an executive at bridgepoint education, a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior, and before that was at career education corp., a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior; eitel reportedly committed when he arrived to recuse himself from matters related to those schools and from the department's review of the gainful employment rule, but apparently not to issues related to for-profit colleges generally. we also can tell you that devos herself invested money in for-profit education, that republicans in congress have long done the bidding of the for-profit college industry, which has donated big money to the gop, and that devos's boss donald trump owned his own for-profit real estate university, whose predatory practices were similar to practices of for-profit colleges that stand to benefit from devos's trashing of the obama rules.
john has always said that if we repeal the aca, there must be a replacement in place that protects people with preexisting conditions, campaign spokesperson abby walls told huffpost.
it's worth being extremely clear about why anyone is worried about people with preexisting conditions in the first place. after all, it's been a full decade since the affordable care act made it illegal for health insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher rates to people based on their medical histories.
simply declaring in an executive order that people with preexisting conditions should be able to buy health insurance if the high court knocks down the aca is entirely meaningless. if it were that simple, some other president would have done it already and become extremely popular. more than that, no president can just order an entire industry to not do something. that's why there's a congress that passes laws.
the 2009 stimulus law started popular: a cnn poll conducted shortly before its passage found 54% of americans supported the law, with 45% in opposition. but unemployment remained high ― it was 9.8% when voters went to the polls in november 2010 ― and republicans ridiculed it as a waste of money, pointing to infrastructure projects that created few jobs and ridiculous-sounding scientific research it funded.
generally we'd like to avoid including generals mattis and mcmaster in our rankings because, although trump's over-reliance on active duty or recently retired military personnel for national security jobs is concerning, at least these men are qualified for their positions and are a major improvement over trump's favorite good guy, the corrupt, vengeful hothead michael flynn.
in fact, some of his supposed accomplishments further give the lie to his claim that he supports protections for preexisting conditions. the trump administration has expanded access to several kinds of health insurance that aren't available to people with preexisting conditions, like short-term health plans.
if we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the american people, we have got to confront a washington culture that is corrupt ― that puts profits ahead of the needs of the american people, he said toward the end of a speech about medicare for all to an audience of cheering supporters in washington. and that is why today i am calling on every democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies. reject that money!
as for the current health care law, on which some 20 million people depend for insurance, its odds of survival seem better than at any time since trump's election, when its repeal seemed nearly inevitable.
mccaughey, already notorious for dishonest attacks on president bill clinton from a decade before, was engaging in wild distortion. the provision merely required that medicare pay for counseling sessions on how to write advance directives. that way, physicians would be able to carve out the time for seniors who wanted help making decisions about end-of-life care in the future.
sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) has rejected donations from top pharmaceutical company executives and corporate board chairs since 2017, though his campaign did not immediately say whether he would do the same for health insurance companies.
fewer protections for people with pre-existing conditions
associated press most of the democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination marched in a martin luther king jr. day rally on monday in columbia, south carolina.
shortly after cotton's speech on thursday, the biden campaign sent out an email blast to reporters with the subject line: donald trump is the weakest president in u.s. history when it comes to china – and chinese officials are pulling for his re-election. the attack memo highlights, among other things, trump's initial reluctance to criticize china's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak, his calls for the chinese government to investigate the bidens to benefit him politically and trump's inaccurate claim that he banned travel to the u.s. from china in order to contain covid-19.
in addition, cbo said, the proportion of americans without health insurance would rise even more dramatically ― by 18 million, which is roughly the number of people who have gotten coverage through the law, according to the most reliable estimates.
the american health care act, the republican proposal to replace the aca, would have amounted to arguably the single biggest rollback of a social welfare program in american history.
cpac has never been ideal turf for trump. though the gathering helped legitimize him among conservatives when he first appeared in 2011, he skipped the conference in 2016, out of fear that the crowd would walk out of his speech in protest. his address on friday sparked no such act of defiance. it was, instead, a fairly well received, if not meandering, attack on the press, and a review of campaign promises.
and although it's impossible to know what role health care played in that race, analysts agree it was a big reason why republicans nationally suffered such big losses, enough to cost them control of the house of representatives.
they understood that the death panel charge had always been a lie ― that it was obamacare's opponents, not its supporters, who were threatening the medically vulnerable.
at issue in trump v. pennsylvania, consolidated with little sisters of the poor v. pennsylvania, were new rules established by the trump administration that vastly expanded the types of organizations that could opt out of the mandate based on religious beliefs or moral objections.
for instance, as the law steamed toward final passage on wednesday, the national republican senatorial committee ― which is partially under mcconnell's control ― pressured democratic senate candidates on whether transgender women should be eligible to play sports, not on whether they supported the covid-19 relief bill.
the national bureau of economic research study found that in the decade before donald trump took office, there might have been a correlation between deportation fears and the drop-off in the number of latino immigrants enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), known as food stamps, and the affordable care act insurance program, also known as obamacare.
trump's promise to rip up the iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.
meanwhile, democrats have begun to wonder, with good reason, whether the specific reforms under discussion could hurt more insurance buyers than they would help.
the guidance under obama... meant that a state's plan couldn't result in fewer people enrolled in affordable, comprehensive coverage, corlette explained. this new guidance is saying that so long as people in the state have 'access' to [comprehensive] coverage, it doesn't matter what they actually do... if un-insurance spikes or there's a big movement to [less comprehensive plans] a state won't get dinged for that.
it's not hard to see why republicans would try to cast themselves as guardians against rising crime in some cities ― to say nothing of the rioting that has spilled out from peaceful demonstrations against police misconduct, particularly in cities like minneapolis, minnesota, and kenosha, wisconsin. that's because it allows the gop to shift from the politically inconvenient terrain of dismissing protests against police misconduct and racism, which a majority of americans support, and turn to the stronger ground of condemning arson and property destruction, which already appear to be turning swing voters against democrats in the general election battleground state of wisconsin.
this kind of mobilization can actually make the gop think twice about how hard they want to push because they know that they're losing women in droves right now, and they know that their political fate for decades to come is on the line, she told huffpost.
at times, sanders' current tour revealed some of the limits of his reach. the crowd at the south carolina rally was somewhat diverse, but it was visibly whiter than the population of columbia, which is 41 percent black.
many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. restoring csr funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. the federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.
james, who has an mba from the university of michigan and works in his family's supply chain business, has played up his credentials as both a businessman and a fresh-faced, energetic outsider. it may be working.
obama also said future democrats need to make different policy design decisions. specifically, he said, they should expect no more cooperation for implementing their reforms than he got for the affordable care act ― although, he warned, without such cooperation, making government programs work is bound to be a lot more difficult:
executive orders like these are little more than campaign press releases printed on fancier stationery. since trump doesn't have the interest or patience to actually work with congress to make laws, he tosses off toothless executive orders and farms out his obamacare repeal efforts to a court system he's packed with his own judges.
below is how mister ip's article appeared on the internet. and let me ask you, what is wrong with this picture?
acting quickly on the mandate could cause serious aftershocks
ben marter, a spokesman for senate minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.), noted that trump had called the post and the times today to discuss health care reform defeats, but not us.
republican officials, who have spent the last eight-plus years trying to undermine and repeal the affordable care act and its provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions, have in recent weeks been saying they are not actually doing the things they are doing.
eliminating the filibuster would mitigate, although not eliminate, the small-state bias ― and obama said that may be necessary. when i pressed to see if he'd endorse the idea more clearly, he said, that's a longer argument and discussion to have. (several months later, at the funeral of democratic rep. john lewis of georgia, obama offered a stronger endorsement for ending the 60-vote requirement, though he was specifically speaking about voting rights legislation.)
although mcelvain has not publicly offered a reason for his resignation, the post article said that his departure highlights internal frustration with the trump administration's decision to support a lawsuit from officials in 20 conservative states. that lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in texas, could wipe out key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
this trend gives obama something to boast about when it comes to his signature domestic achievement, but the affordable care act still faces considerable challenges in the next few years that could jeopardize these gains in coverage. obama has floated policies to fix some, but not all, of the problems with the law.
we're going to be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future, ryan admitted friday. i don't know what else to say other than obamacare is the law of the land.
the public still holds largely partisan views on the health reform law, and opinions have remained relatively unchanged since the republican efforts to repeal it. but according to recent democratic polling, the electorate still prefers congressional democrats' approach to the issue over congressional republicans' approach by a double-digit margin.
twitter went bonkers over trump's announcement.
trump's sycophant, fired transition head, and fellow climate change denier chris christie moved himself into final governor dgaf status by mismanaging his state budget, closing state beaches for the holiday weekend, using his exclusive access to lie across one of those state beaches, and then barely trying to cover it up (with a baseball hat).
in houston, at the epiphany community health outreach services, a local nonprofit that works with the immigrant community, snap enrollment dropped by a third compared with this time last year. meanwhile, participation in the food pantry program increased 266 percent, according to the center.
the proposal from alexander and collins seeks to mitigate those kinds of increases, primarily through two new spending initiatives. one would allocate $30.5 billion over three years for reinsurance and invisible high-risk pools, each of which would reimburse insurers for the beneficiaries with the biggest medical bills ― thereby allowing insurers to reduce premiums.
in fact, the agreement has forced iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. the $1.7 billion the united states gave to iran was money it held in u.s. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by u.s. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.
[t]his court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets, she wrote, joined by justice sonia sotomayor. faced with high out-of-pocket costs, many women will forgo contraception … or resort to less effective contraceptive methods.
so far, he has been given a fair amount of leeway.
brendan mcdermid/reuters sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), right, criticized joe biden for signing off on trade deals that cost the u.s. manufacturing jobs. trump is attacking biden's trade record as well.
i am half-black and president obama was half-black and i know when i see a black person and a white person who can genuinely get along with one another, she said.
washington republicans, meanwhile, predict a replay. they argue the legislation's popularity will drop as voters are exposed to less popular aspects of the law, and suggest it won't serve as the economic rocket ship democrats are expecting.
late this week, trump and gop leaders agreed to modify the bill by eliminating a requirement that all insurance plans cover essential benefits, such as mental health and maternity care, and then offering special funds to cover the costs of precisely those services. experts immediately warned that making these changes could dramatically alter health insurance markets, making it difficult to find comprehensive coverage as insurers would gravitate toward offering less generous policies.
as sanders was walking out of the facility in shirtsleeves, a student called out to him. bernie, are you tired yet?
just as donald trump displays the shadow side of xenophobic white america, the wall street journal's choice of this particular photo with this article unconsciously displays what many republicans think but seldom say (even david duke doesn't publicly say it anymore): we can't trust black people. they are lazy and when given the opportunity they will bilk the system. (they make marvelous singers, dancers, and athletes, but aside from their entertainment value, they are really quite a burden on society.) that is what the wall street journal tacitly told its readers when it decided to publish that particular photo with that particular article.
the good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the affordable care act, cornyn said in a pbs austin interview. as you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. so that's an option for people.

there's no need to speculate about how insurance companies would respond to this, because this is how the system worked for people who bought individual policies before the affordable care act. insurers don't make money paying claims; they make money by avoiding claims or refusing the pay them. if they're allowed to keep the most expensive people and treatments off their books, they will.
those kinds of compromises are frequently deflating. that doesn't mean they should be, and the affordable care act is an example of why. it still achieved a lot ― more, in fact, than even many liberals seem to grasp. it's already transformed the political conversation on health care, so that the principles of universal coverage now have wide acceptance.
of course, he may is not the same as he will. and trump's executive order didn't change policy or otherwise commit the administration to a course of action. it was simply a statement of intent. the president and his deputies are under no obligation to follow through.
but the transformation of the republicans into a more ideologically and temperamentally extreme party really has changed american politics in profound ways, and democrats really do need to adapt to that transformation if they want to succeed. that means paying attention to what went wrong with the affordable care act ― although, to be clear, it also means recognizing what went right. and obama has some ideas about that too.
miller also described the potential for a downward financial and health spiral for some americans, calling it a double hit.
heller, for example, is facing a major challenge to his re-election in large part because of his flip-flopping on affordable care act repeal and eventual support for the last version of the legislation to replace it. that bill was the brainchild of cassidy and graham and absolutely would have weakened pre-existing condition protections.
under the lran deal legislation passed by congress, trump must certify every 90 days whether iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of u.s. sanctions. trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. last october, he refused to certify that iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, may 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.
maybe market forces - ie. profitability - are incompatible or inapplicable when saving people's lives? unless, of course, you believe that only rich people's lives are worth saving because their wealth is merely a sign that god truly loves them (c.f. max weber's the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism).
but congress and the administration failed to come to a deal after intense lobbying by hospital and physician groups, and the private equity companies that own medical practices that make tons of money from surprise bills.
fear is a constant, he said, and these days many of his friends who don't have papers stay close to home. so, he said, gesturing to an extra bag of groceries from today's food pantry, he does what he can to help them out.
if a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don't buy him a knife, south carolina sen. lindsey graham said at a feb. 10, 2016 town hall. this iran deal is the worst deal.
i knew the republicans would do everything in their power to try and repeal obamacare, biden said in an email to supporters monday. but i'm surprised that so many democrats are running on getting rid of it.
although the details of the argument evolved over time, the gist was always the same: obamacare would ration treatments for society's most vulnerable members, like the disabled and the elderly, because their lives wouldn't be deemed worth the expense of saving.
if you're caught in an insurance trap, where cobra is too expensive, you live in a state that didn't expand medicaid, and aren't eligible for subsidized private insurance through obamacare, what happens when you need to go to the er, miller asked rhetorically: you lose your labor market income and you can potentially face some financial hits if you need necessary medical care — you go to the er — that can have an impact on your credit score.
that last requirement, implemented by house speaker nancy pelosi's top health care staffer, wendell primus, according to sources, is particularly an issue for some single-payer advocates, because they believe the hearing could turn into an exercise in which witnesses seem to endorse all sorts of different approaches to health care ― the aca, a medicare buy-in situation, and perhaps, maybe, medicare for all.
i think the important thing is that people have a choice in their selection of a plan, added sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.)
they could change their minds of course. and the pressure to enact these policies could build, thanks to a progressive movement that is already louder and more organized around goals than it was during obama's presidency. but even if democrats succeed at reducing structural barriers to change, and even if a progressive movement succeeds in demanding more action, legislation is likely to be full of compromises and fall short of democrats' loftiest goals, just like the affordable care act did.
the rally was the product of a longstanding invitation from the state's our revolution chapter, according to his staff, which did not comment on the absence of the various candidates.
in a statement, pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro, who challenged the trump rules, said he was disappointed in the ruling but was not giving up. we now return to the lower courts to address whether the exemptions are arbitrary and capricious, he said. this fight is not over. in a dissent, justice ruth bader ginsburg issued a stark warning about the potential impact of the ruling on employees.
in some states, cuts would happen automatically because the executive actions or laws authorizing expansion call for restoring the pre-expansion eligibility standards if the extra federal funds stop flowing.
donald trump has lost the presidential election, but his last, desperate effort to kill the affordable care act will get its day before the u.s. supreme court on tuesday, when the justices hear arguments in a republican-backed lawsuit alleging that obamacare is unconstitutional.
and that's just one example in which the courts would have to sort out modifications to the affordable care act that congress has passed since its inception.
digital first media/longmont times-call/getty images sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) greets supporters in boulder, colorado, on wednesday. as he campaigns on behalf of the democratic cause in this year's midterms, he's also gearing up for another white house run.
associated press visitors to the department of labor march 18 are turned away at the door by personnel due to closures over coronavirus concerns in new york. a record-high number of people applied for unemployment benefits as layoffs engulfed the united states.
(reuters) - uncertainty surrounding the republican plan to replace obamacare is forcing someu.s. hospitals to delay expansion plans, cut costs, or take on added risk to borrow money for capital investment projects, dealing an economic blow to these facilities and the towns they call home.
but even if hatch and grassley were truly interested in bipartisanship, they did not speak for their party or for leadership, which from the beginning urged members to oppose obama's agenda fully ― as mitch mcconnell, who was (and is again) the senate minority leader, later admitted. all of this happened at a time when the gop was also becoming more ideologically extreme, with conservatives displacing the remaining moderates.
reconciliation rules stipulate that only provisions with a direct effect on the federal budget may get consideration through this process. that could exclude many of the regulatory changes that more conservative republicans want to make, like changes to rules regarding what insurance covers. these rules also require the legislation, on net, to reduce the budget deficit.
the energy we saw around this day of action was even bigger than what we saw in the early days of kavanaugh because what we said then is becoming real to people, which is: they're going for broke, said ilyse hogue, president of naral pro-choice america. and that doesn't mean just overturning roe. it means criminalizing abortion, challenging rape, trying to control women. women all over the country see that as a very real threat now.
trump claimed it's never been done before.
james tried to deflect the anger by insisting that, notwithstanding his support of repeal, he was committed to preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions. he lost anyway.
trump told senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) in december: i'll be proud to shut down the government for border security. he subsequently refused to sign a federal spending bill unless he was allocated $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. on thursday, a joint statement from unions representing pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers said the risk to air safety of the partial government shutdown was incalculable and unprecedented.
i think that the enrollment period should have been reopened, collins said in the interview. one of the reasons that i pushed the paycheck protection program so hard is that if we can keep people on their regular payroll, many more people will continue to receive their health insurance.
tom williams via getty images there's wariness that the hearing on medicare for all could end up supporting house speaker nancy pelosi's position that the best way forward is to make fixes to the affordable care act.
jonathan ernst/reuters french president emmanuel macron tried to persuade u.s. president donald trump to remain in the iran nuclear agreement during his white house visit this week.
less than 24 hours before, trump had issued an ultimatum to the house, demanding a vote on what both he and republican leaders had identified as a top legislative priority ― and threatening to move on to other legislative items if they refused.
with the new medical center, prince george's county hopes to end its long-time reliance on $30 million annually from public subsidies to help cover operations. but that goal assumed obamacare would remain intact, said thomas himler, prince george's deputy chief administrative officer.
to make her action even worse, devos in her official notification claimed that her delay in enforcing the rule for all schools across the country was in light of contreras's new decision, even though that decision applied only to a narrow set of appeals pursued by a small group of cosmetology schools.
during his 40-minute remarks in south carolina and in three speeches in iowa later on saturday and on sunday in iowa, sanders did little to conceal that he is strongly considering another presidential run. he spent a good chunk of his time recounting how the policies he championed as a presidential candidate are now squarely in the democratic mainstream.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) who ended her presidential campaign in december, took an early shot at biden's record on race, attacking the former vice president on his stance on integrated busing in the 1970s. but biden appeared to have weathered that attack.
in a call to arms designed to further affirm his populist credentials and distinguish himself in a crowded primary field, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) committed on wednesday to reject contributions of $200 or more from executives at the country's pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, as well as the political action committees and lobbyists who represent them.
it's a head-scratching political move. during an election year that's shaping up to be a disaster for the republican party, its national leader and prominent officials around the country are taking a strong stand against enabling sick people to go to the doctor.
some struggle to pay premiums, while others decide not to get insurance altogether. those problems are likely to get even worse next year, because the 2017 republican tax bill eliminated the penalty for people who don't get insurance. without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get insurance, causing premiums to rise.
trump's proposal has many in congress wondering if this plan is doable, since many of their constituency could actually end up paying more taxes. however, according to the tax policy center, almost half of the benefits of trump's plan would gravitate to the top 1 percent or those earning more than $700,000 annually. but the bigger question is, given trump's political and possibly legal problems, will such a plan actually occur?
washington ― one month into his presidency, donald trump's popularity has begun tanking with every constituency, save one.
in general, the political effect of conventions has been declining for years as partisanship and polarization has risen, and the democratic convention provided little boost for biden's campaign. expect the polls, and the voters they survey, to give trump the same treatment.
coverage for preexisting conditions is already the law of the land, he said. now, not only is he lying to you about giving you something you already have, he's actively trying to take it away, cuomo added.
when i read his letter, it made a powerful impact on me, obama said. brent is why we fought so hard to fix a broken health care system in the first place.
one of the most striking things about the final night of the republican national convention was the degree to which speakers singled out new york city as an embodiment of the failures of urban democratic rule.
the trump administration's decision and, now, mcelvain's departure have some experts worried about the future of the justice department, which historically has tried to insulate these sort of legal functions from partisanship and political meddling from above.
either way, it's a lot more like a death panel than anything democrats and their supporters ever tried.
cities that didn't cooperate with secure communities didn't see the same declines.
even without the rare moments of honesty, however, we would know this is what republicans want because of the simple fact that they've been trying to slash health care programs for decades.
clients may drop out for a host of reasons, such as frustrations with submitting paperwork, said jared call, the group's managing policy advocate. and as the economy improves, there's a decline in food stamp enrollment as well.
finally, trump said at a white house unleashing american energy event that he planned to cancel obama-era limits on u.s. financing for overseas coal projects and that he would accelerate efforts to effectively turn american communities into energy colonies mined for fossil fuels to export overseas. we have nearly 100 years' worth of natural gas and more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal, trump said. we will be dominant. we will export american energy all over the world, all around the globe. trump is selling the idea of clean coal at a time when even litigious coal baron and trump booster bob murray admits that the process of trying to make clean coal through the process of carbon capture and sequestration does not work.
now another national debate is taking place. it's about how to open up businesses in the country amid a coronavirus pandemic that has already killed more than 102,000 people, many of them elderly and unwell, and is sure to kill many more.
there's a perception that poor people want handouts, and immigrants are lumped into that category, said eric rodriguez, vice president of research, advocacy and legislation for unidosus, formerly national council on la raza, an advocacy group based in washington. he said that's not the case.
but consumers who use navigators frequently end up enrolling in medicaid, the children's health insurance program or other special programs ― or simply enrolling on their own, at home, after long consultation with navigators. as a result, they don't show up as enrolling in the private marketplace plans, which is the metric cms is using to judge navigator performance.
but when sanders walked onto the university of south carolina stage to the adulation of some 1,000 supporters waving medicare for y'all placards, it was clear that he had his share of supporters here. feeding on the crowd's energy, he dispensed with his detractors with a bit of gentle sarcasm.
trump is once again trapped in the unique new york city culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, when he first tried his hand at right-wing demagoguery. in 1989, trump took out a full-page ad in new york city newspapers calling for the state to revive the death penalty to punish the central park five ― a group of black and latino teenagers accused of raping a woman in manhattan. when the young men were exonerated by dna evidence decades later, trump declined to apologize for whipping up public sentiment against them.
biden does not support defunding the police. biden has actually proposed increased federal funding for police departments to hire additional officers, while trump has proposed cutting federal funds for local departments in each of the budgets of his presidency.
trump is again this week's number one in republic report's trump team disgracefulness power rankings. trump is not merely a disgrace; he's a total and complete disgrace.
former arkansas gov. mike huckabee went even further, essentially accusing obama of enabling the eventual genocide of israelis. it is so naive that he would trust the iranians. by doing so he will take the israelis and march them to the door of the oven, he said on july 26, 2015.
just 31 percent of americans approve of the new alabama anti-abortion law, according to a new huffpost/yougov poll. a quarter of americans who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases disapprove of the law, as do about a third of republicans, self-described evangelical christians and self-described conservatives.
so it makes sense that donald trump just named mccaughey to his team of economic advisers.
normally, the u.s. department of justice defends federal laws from challenges like this. not this time. instead, attorney general jeff sessions is asking a federal judge to leave most of the law in place, except for the parts about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. no, really.
our failure to repeal and replace obamacare is the surest sign that we need someone who will go and work their tail off to remove this monstrosity, james says in the clip, which he recorded while he was seeking the gop nomination to run against michigan's other democratic senator, debbie stabenow. it was a key issue in his campaign; in an october 2018 debate, james said we took a system that was broken and made it worse.
graham said it would be a nice gesture for ivanka & jared to attend, but cleared it w/ cindy mccain first, rogers tweeted, referring to mccain's widow.
biden's campaign ― which has been holding out hope that a big win in south carolina would give the former vice president the momentum he needs to win in states across the country ― has said from the beginning that it's important to restore the soul of the nation against donald trump's administration. on saturday, biden rephrased: his campaign also wants this election to be about the soul of the democratic party.
two weeks of the major party political conventions delivered 16 hours of prime-time programming, more than 120 individual speakers, dozens of pre-produced glossy videos and zero fundamental change in the race.
sanders congratulated biden from a rally in virginia beach on saturday night, telling his supporters that you can't win them all. his campaign said it was confident in its ability to meet the threshold to win some delegates in south carolina, but already had set its sights on super tuesday. sanders spent the last week campaigning in california, texas, virginia, north carolina and south carolina.
but it is not just differences over reproductive rights that are standing in the way of passage.
when did aetna first inform investors that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of humana? what other risks did the company disclose to investors?
hard things are hard; better is good
at an oyster fry in orangeburg, south carolina, that same night, biden would invoke obama's name 13 times in a speech that lasted just shy of 20 minutes.
and gop presidential candidates like donald trump continue to call for obamacare's repeal and replacement with other policies that wouldn't provide coverage to those who gained insurance because of the aca, and could even result in larger numbers of uninsured than before obama's reforms took effect.
trump sees china as joe biden's weak point
granted, building coalitions around ambitious proposals takes time and building movements around them on the campaign trail only helps. but as heated as the debate over medicare for all has been so far, the presidential candidates who support implementing some permeation of it will have to convince more of their democratic colleagues in the senate to support it if it has any chance of becoming law in the near future.
in the moments after it was announced that his health care bill was dead and pulled from consideration, president donald trump had pinpointed the culprit. democrats, he explained, were to blame for the failure because they refused to provide him with any of their votes.
(pressed about the same tweet on meet the press, health and human services secretary tom price (june 10 ranking: 7) tried to attack host chuck todd, saying he wanted to discuss health care and asking, your program, a program with the incredible history of 'meet the press,' and that's what you want to talk about? when todd responded by asking why trump didn't seem to be as devoted to this [health care] as you are, price offered his own suck-up to his potus: he can do more than one thing at a time.)
these findings, based on several surveys, are merely the latest proof that, whatever its shortcomings, the affordable care act has succeeded in its primary goal of reducing the number of americans who lack health insurance. the share of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance was 11.5 percent as of february, down from 20.3 percent in october 2013, according to the report. other polls that include children and people over 65 show an even lower uninsured rate.

in response to questions about there not being a true medicare for all advocate on the panel, the rules committee pointed to baker and sent a nowthis video of nahvi endorsing single-payer health care. (nahvi also wrote an op-ed in the guardian that speaks positively about single-payer.)
the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) announced the cut late tuesday. the cut will affect navigators, the nonprofit organizations that the federal government pays to help with enrollment in the states that use healthcare.gov as their online marketplace for people trying to get coverage through the affordable care act.
trump's new national security adviser, john bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on iran and other countries in his fox news appearances. and newly confirmed secretary of state mike pompeo, as a kansas congressman in december 2015, told a westminster institute audience that the only real solution in iran was the abolition of the current regime.
ap photo/evan vucci these pieces of paper won't make your health insurance, medical bills or prescription drugs any cheaper.
right now in the middle of a public health crisis and an economic crisis, not knowing whether you're going to have that important health coverage when you go to pick up your prescription is really terrifying, she said. this isn't what the intent of the affordable care act was.
the change raises the stakes on the 2018 midterms, because it means, among other things, that state officials, many of whom appear on this year's ballot, will have even more power to shape (and reshape) their health care markets.
a key problem with the plan is that the federal deduction for state and local income taxes would be eliminated, thereby hurting taxpayers in new york, california, or massachusetts who pay high amounts. the residents of those and other such states would be severely hurt since their taxes are much higher than places like florida and texas, and would actually see a severely substantial tax increase. according to the congressional joint committee on taxation, taxpayers using this deduction save more than $100 billion, which is actually greater than the mortgage interest deduction.
the u.s. department of immigration and customs enforcement recently arrested a number of immigrants in the center's neighborhood, and lacayo worries about further actions. what if the united states revokes his residency?
those conservative democrats were the ones who were dead set against the public option. they were the ones who kept pushing to give state officials more power over the program. they were the ones most anxious over new spending. and those decisions had consequences later, when the law took effect. among other things, it meant less financial assistance for some middle-class americans buying insurance.
those focus-group-tested slogans sound great! except they're hogwash.
and as much as republicans point to tillis' bill as evidence of their desire to protect people with preexisting conditions, it has little chance of passing in a divided senate. moreover, experts say it would allow insurers to exclude coverage of some preexisting conditions anyway, calling its provisions a mirage.

to be sure, such attitudes aren't persuasive for everyone.
lawmakers from both parties had collaborated in the late 1990s to create a new program for insuring children. the senators who led that effort were orrin hatch, the conservative republican from utah, and ted kennedy, the liberal democrat from massachusetts. at one point in 2008, a former kennedy aide told me, hatch dispatched his advisers to see if the two could work together on a universal coverage bill.
there is also the proposal to eliminate itemized tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable giving. mnuchin stated that the reasoning behind this move was to eliminate tax loopholes while offsetting the reduction in the base tax rate for americans in higher income brackets. the problem here is that there are certain taxpayers who are not in the higher tax brackets and may need those itemized deductions in order to lower their tax liability. in the end, they may actually see their federal income tax bill increase and not feel the proposed beneficial effect of trump's plan.
in general, it was an attempt to shift the race from a referendum on trump's performance ― a referendum trump is very likely to fail ― toward a choice between himself and biden. trump mentioned biden's name more than 40 times in his speech thursday night. biden never directly mentioned trump during his speech the week before.
mary actually took her own necklace off and tossed it onto her bed! insouciantly. it clattered.
the law has allowed something like 20 million people to get insurance, bringing the number of uninsured to a record low. predictions that the law would cause national health care costs to skyrocket have proved spectacularly wrong, as have predictions that the law would cause the deficit to explode or kill the job market.
those hardships are real. people who can't pay their bills go hungry, lose their homes and can't pay their medical bills. that is why even public health experts want to come up with smart, careful ways to relax pandemic restrictions.
many of these people remember, angrily, the promise from president barack obama that they could keep their old plans if they liked them. and in states like iowa, which have some of the highest rates for unsubsidized customers, gop state officials have been among the most aggressive in seeking ways to weaken or eliminate the affordable care act's rules.
nextgen's research into young voter opinions about biden found many knew little about the former vice president, especially those whose political awakening post-dated former president barack obama's successful 2008 campaign. some were unaware of biden's stances on issues such as gun control, immigration and health care, and saw him as little more than another career politician.
ivanka and jared said nothing when a wh staffer joked about mccain's death. they stayed silent while trump attacked mccain repeatedly. whether they were invited or not, ivanka and jared should have stayed home. — a little royal (@alittlebitroyal) september 1, 2018
the orders don't do anything about anything, though. it's just more vaporware from the trump administration. slogans, lies and exaggerations aren't policies. trump pitched his phantom plan by saying it rests on three pillars: more choice, lower costs, and better care, and that it would put patients first.
medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, indian health service reforms, the medicaid expansion, fda authority over generic biologics — all would fall by the wayside, jost said.
this time, the agency that runs the health insurance exchanges is slashing funds for organizations that help people to shop for coverage, forcing the groups to make do with about one-fourth of the federal funding they got for this year's open enrollment.
the answers from hillary clinton and donald trump provided a near-perfect distillation of very different ways they think about the world ― and how, most likely, they would govern as president.
jonathan ernst / reuters demonstrators at the supreme court in 2015, which is the last time a lawsuit threatening the affordable care act got a hearing before the justices.
while primus told staffers the reason they needed to find witnesses who had not spoken poorly of the aca was because they didn't want republicans using the hearing as an opportunity to attack obamacare, sources believe there were ulterior motives.
joel is a civil servant through and through ― principled, dedicated to his country and nonpartisan, nicholas bagley, who served at justice from 2007 to 2010 and is now at the university of michigan, told huffpost. if people like him are jumping ship, it's a troubling sign of institutional rot at the justice department.
the iran deal is just one instance where trump's not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.
maybe winston churchill can be a future guest and the dowager countess will be the one who pushes him to return england to the gold standard, which will plunge england into chaos. talk about tradition!
but the republican majority in the senate isn't interested in pursuing additional emergency relief for those who suddenly find themselves uninsured.
or maybe those canadians aren't so dumb after all and have figured out how to provide better healthcare opportunities to a wider range of people and not just the anointed elite?
i saw the same thing about 15 years ago, and then all of a sudden he walked into the office, mccallum said in his sermon. this young man by the name of barack obama said, 'yes we can.' i'm here to say we will.
we had no democrat support. we had no votes from the democrats, trump explained. with no democrats on board, we couldn't quite get there.
but in iowa last month, conservative republican gov. kim reynolds resisted calls to shut down plants with severe coronavirus outbreaks. patience roggensack, the conservative chief justice of the wisconsin supreme court, questioned the state's shutdown order because the big spike in illness was among meatpacking workers (often immigrants), and not and the regular folks.
navigators also target people with special needs, including those with complicated medical or financial situations that make eligibility for federal programs confusing. these are precisely the sorts of people who might not respond to routine advertising or find the help they need through commercial brokers.
a pelosi spokesman, henry connelly, also said in a statement that the rules committee had free rein to choose whichever witnesses they wanted to articulate the strongest case for medicare for all.
following publication of this article, it came to huffpost's attention that harris had in fact received contributions over $200 from 14 people who appeared to be pharmaceutical executives. the harris campaign told huffpost it had already returned two of those donations and was in the process of returning 10 more. the campaign said it wasn't sure whether the other two are from pharmaceutical executives and is seeking clarification.
if the action against obamacare by trump's doj succeeds, some 20 million americans would lose their health insurance amid the covid-19 crisis.
right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of u.s. taxpayer cash.
scholten, a former minor league baseball pitcher and devout catholic, is a natural ideological fit for the brooklyn-born sanders. casting himself as heir to the forgotten tradition of farmer populists in iowa, scholten is running in support of medicare for all and taking on the monopoly seed and livestock conglomerates he believes are squeezing small farmers.
political opportunism helps to explain the apparent shift. in 2009, republicans and conservatives were trying to block legislation from then-president barack obama. now they are trying to promote and defend president donald trump, who has been agitating to end social distancing to open businesses and revive the economy.
it's a complicated set of changes, but it means that some residents of states seeking the waivers could end up with easier access to cheaper, skimpier health plans, providing an alternative to those who cannot afford to pay for comprehensive coverage that the affordable care act has made available.
trump's speech thursday nicely illustrates the convention's lack of impact. trump rattled off a long, meandering list of already well-known or politically irrelevant accomplishments and repeated well-worn attacks on biden. the speech came without any of the gusto that defines his most off-the-rails rally performances but with all of the lies and distortions he typically delivers.
trump, after all, famously promised during his presidential campaign that he wouldn't touch medicare or medicaid. then he won the election. the gop is hoping that pattern repeats itself this election day.
near the end of the conversation, i thought back to something obama said at the march 2010 signing ceremony: we are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities. we are a nation that does what is hard. what is necessary. had the difficulty passing and implementing obamacare shaken that faith?
medicare recipients would also feel the effects. the affordable care act bolstered it in several ways, most obviously by gradually eliminating a gap in prescription drug coverage that became known as the doughnut hole. without the affordable care act in place, that gap could open back up, leaving seniors to pay more money for their drugs.
the ultimate futility of courting republicans — so memorable today — is one of many grievances more progressive democrats still hold over obama's handling of the health care law. and in the popular imagination, it is the main reason obama made so many key compromises, like dropping a public option — the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would offer a more efficient, more patient-friendly alternative to private insurance.
but if the lack of democratic support was to blame for this governing debacle, trump has no one to blame but himself.
it's a ridiculous question, farage said, in between drags from his cigarette. it's a ludicrous question. i don't know. ... what you've seen in the first few days is his full intention to carry out his campaign promises. how refreshing.
one of those structural problems, he said, is that the conservative media universe operates in an entirely different universe, less tethered to reality. another, he said, is the makeup u.s. senate, where the small-state bias gives lawmakers representing a small portion of the population the ability to block legislation ― and to escape accountability for doing so.
so that's where all the lying comes from. fortunately, the truth is easy to find. if the gop survives what's shaping up to be a brutal election year and retains control of congress, rest assured they will again come for health care. they always try.
two years later and still bashing the agreement, trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the iranian nuclear program.
among the provision's chief proponents was sen. johnny isakson (r-ga.), who thought the incendiary portrayals of it were nuts.
florida sen. marco rubio, former florida gov. jeb bush, ohio gov. john kasich, even texas sen. ted cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said rick tyler, a republican political consultant who worked for cruz.
but when the detroit free press editorial board pushed james for details on how he would do that, he said he's not a healthcare expert and that he'd rely on experts to work out a market-based solution. the free press ultimately endorsed peters.
unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the affordable care act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, larry levitt, who runs health policy at kff, said in a statement. as unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their medicaid programs under the aca will move into the medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.
and let's not forget what congress did last year, even though that's what gop candidates want everyone to do.
levitt called the regulatory change a major end run around the health law.
during the course of putting together the repeal-and-replace process for obamacare, trump never once reached out to a member of the democratic leadership to discuss policy matters or vote counts. house minority leader nancy pelosi's office confirmed as much. so too did senate minority leader chuck schumer's office.
the deal was achieved by obama. the republican primary voting base hated obama. anything obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.
during his first year in office, trump's top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the iran deal. but in the past two months, trump has fired national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and secretary of state rex tillerson, leaving defense secretary jim mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.
trump's new solution? an executive order that directs the department of health and human services to start coming up with some kind of plan next year if congress doesn't pass a bill by jan. 1, 2021. he will instruct me to investigate executive actions and regulatory actions that we can take that will ensure that patients are nonetheless protected against surprise medical bills, is how azar described it.
department of health and human services the uninsured rate for working-age adults has declined since 2013, according to a new federal report.
but among iowa's three gop-held house seats, democrats like their odds better in the 1st congressional district, which includes dubuque and cedar rapids, and the 3rd, which includes the des moines metropolitan area. sanders' campaign did not reach out to the campaigns of abby finkenauer, the democrat running in the 1st, or cindy axne, the nominee in the 3rd. while finkenauer does not appear with out-of-state democrats, axne welcomed sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) to a campaign rally on monday.
but upon closer inspection, the conservative positions then and now have a common theme. it's about whose lives deserve the protection of government programs. and whose don't.
polling shows biden leading trump by significant margins among young people, both nationally and in key swing states. but top democratic operatives have long worried about young people's relative lack of enthusiasm to actually cast a ballot in 2020 and fear it could prove politically deadly in a close race.
and the consequences of a decision going in the other direction, wiping out the affordable care act, would be enormous.
president donald trump was famously not invited to the memorial service of sen. john mccain, which took place saturday at the national cathedral in washington. the president's daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law jared kushner were in attendance, however.
steve ricchetti, biden's campaign chairman, has lobbied for major pharmaceutical companies. biden's campaign has also received contributions from 15 pharmaceutical and health insurance company executives.
most immigrants do not use food stamps and other forms of public assistance. the vast majority of food stamp beneficiaries — 92 percent — are u.s.-born citizens. four percent are naturalized citizens, 1 percent are refugees, and 3 percent are other noncitizens, according to the u.s. department of agriculture. the average benefit for one person is $126.76 a month.
put more simply, conservatives worried that repeal didn't go far enough, while moderates worried that it went too far. every effort republican leaders made to appease one group alienated the other.
matthew edward, 23, came to cpac from illinois. trump was his third choice for president, after ben carson and ted cruz. but on thursday, he roamed the halls in a maga hat, perfectly content with how the administration was operating.
the latest blow, and surely not the last one
jeff weaver, a senior adviser to the sanders campaign, shot back on wednesday, suggesting it was unrealistic. without unicorns, magic wands ... health care is not free, he said on msnbc.
republican officials from 20 states are asking a federal judge in texas to overturn the entire affordable care act, which would include its provisions guaranteeing access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.
but one difference between the fight over the affordable care act versus abortion was that on the aca, most of the battle was in congress ― and getting rid of gop members who wanted to repeal the law. but on abortion, much of the fight rests with the supreme court, symbolized by the fact that the protest was on the steps of the institution tuesday.
the merits of the case are notoriously weak. even conservative and libertarian lawyers who supported past challenges to obamacare have filed friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to reject this one. for that reason, many legal observers think the chances of this lawsuit succeeding are relatively small.
on tuesday, cms justified its decision based on the navigator programs' results ― in particular, the fact that, according to official statistics, less than 1 percent of people signing up for plans on healthcare.gov had enrolled through a navigator.
but the most telling part of trump's answer was when he described his alternative. after making the case for allowing cross-state purchase of insurance ― which would potentially lower premiums, but only by allowing insurers to escape existing regulations on benefits and sales practices ― trump said the following:
the individual mandate and why it matters
the second major lie was that biden supports efforts to eliminate police budgets, part of trump's efforts to portray biden ― a veteran politician with a clear center-left ideology and track record ― as a stalking-horse for the left-most elements of the democratic party. if you give power to joe biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across america, trump said.
my son has a preexisting condition ... i will always fight to protect your health care, james told wxyz-tv, the abc affiliate in detroit.
people were led to expect an immediate and overwhelming impact of that legislation, and that as the recovery dragged on with year after year of very slow employment growth, the popularity of the bill just plummeted, said michael steel, a republican operative who worked as a spokesperson for then-house minority leader john boehner at the time.
today trump has arrived in european to represent our nation in crucial discussions with leaders of key nations. he's already insisted in a press conference in poland that nobody really knows who hacked the u.s. election, even though the entire intelligence community told him it was russia. with north korea developing a missile that could deliver nuclear warheads to u.s. territory, and so many other dangers and challenges in the world, is this the man with which we are to defend america?
in colorado, an ad for sen. cory gardner, who also supported repeal legislation, showcases his mother, a cancer survivor. then he promises to protect people with preexisting conditions no matter what happens to obamacare.
downton abbey should come with a warning label now, because julian fellowes is clearly going for broke in its final season.

hence, trump team disgracefulness power rankings, counting down the week's ten most disgraceful figures in the trump administration. will yourself off opioids (see 7 below) and grab a ringside seat.
election day is 40 days away, and trump knows he's on the wrong side of public opinion on health care. he's going to keep repeating falsehoods and misrepresentations about his health care record and agenda. but the totality of his actions as president makes very clear that his promises of better, cheaper health care are extremely hard to believe.
insurers could go back to screening customers for health status, as they did before the health care law took effect, charging higher premiums or denying coverage altogether to people who have histories of cancer, diabetes or even plain old allergies.
the bills republicans produced that year would have weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions while leaving many millions without insurance, as independent analysts, including the congressional budget office, confirmed.
according to a poll conducted last month by the henry j. kaiser family foundation, 64 percent of americans surveyed said they do not want the courts to do this, with 62 percent of respondents saying a candidate's position on pre-existing conditions is very important or the most important factor in whom they will support.
no, he said quickly, because it passed, and 20 million people got health insurance, and it's still there. then he paused, opened his eyes a bit wider, and started up again: but i think what it does reveal is some major structural problems in our current political system that make it much harder to do big things than it used to be.
but a minority of consumers must pay full premiums, because their household incomes are more than four times the poverty line. (that's about $100,000 for a family of four.) and in some parts of the country, like iowa and tennessee, premiums have skyrocketed ― partly because of design flaws in the 2010 health care law, and partly because of republican efforts to undermine its implementation.
the boisterous health care rally showed the unique position sanders occupies within the already-crowded field of rumored 2020 presidential contenders: he's done it before and he has the organizational muscle to show for it, even in a state like south carolina where he fared poorly in '16.
an eerie fox news video of donald trump talking about an economic crash and riots as a route back to when america was great has resurfaced as the longest government shutdown in u.s. history continues to fray services.
two of obama's favorite sayings are hard things are hard and better is good. both apply in this case, and today's democrats would do well to keep them both in mind.
a big reason for that is the same one that checked liberal ambitions in 2009: the resistance of more conservative democrats. already two of them, west virginia's joe manchin and arizona's kyrsten sinema, have said they would oppose eliminating the filibuster. they've also expressed skepticism about ideas high on the progressive agenda, like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
primus also did himself no favors in a march 25 meeting with staff from a number of congressional committees that have health care jurisdiction. he reportedly said the medicare for all hearing was a check the box and move on type of thing.
ip writes, so how can the aca be fixed? democrats' solution is, essentially, more subsidies. mr. obama has called for a public option, a federal health plan to supplement private insurers. hillary clinton, the democratic nominee for president, goes even further: she wants anyone over 55 to be able to opt into medicare. both would nudge the u.s. closer to a 'single payer' model like canada's that liberal activists have long sought. yet this would require a lot more money and further erode market forces in health care. (fyi, just as family values is republican code for anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage, canada is republican code for socialism.)
mcgovern also noted in his statement that he worked with jayapal and staff from the office of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) to help plan the hearing. i am a cosponsor of this bill and i'm proud to convene the first-ever hearing on medicare for all as congress works toward universal coverage, mcgovern said.
one republican adviser close to the white house said on condition of anonymity that trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the iran deal or policy issues generally. he doesn't know, the adviser said. and he doesn't care.
by the middle of 2009, jim demint, the arch-conservative south carolina republican who had riled up tea party activists by promising that defeating reform would be obama's waterloo, was setting the tone on health care. grassley, facing the threat of a conservative primary challenge, started talking about death panels at events back home. and in a meeting obama later described in his memoir, the iowa senator told the former president there was no concession that would win his vote.
whether trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like nato, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about nato. in august 2015, trump told nbc news that he learned military policy from the shows ― television news and interview programs.
why gop leaders couldn't get the votes
negotiations to include the proposal as part of the big spending bill moving through congress have broken down, as peter sullivan of the hill first reported monday. the primary reason is a dispute over federal funding of abortions: republican leaders are insisting the proposal include restrictions that most democrats will not support.
but conservative republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. they say the affordable care act violates the hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. the alexander-collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.
patrick lynch, the head of new york city's largest police union, depicted the city under de blasio as a lawless hellhole that would not be out of place in a batman film.
and all of them, they say, are afraid.
and once again it is a subset of conservatives and republicans resisting these steps, by seeking to end extensions of unemployment benefits and fighting aid to state and local governments that would finance other public services.
if only there was something, we can call it the affordable care act, and it can have exactly those types of protections and coverages and....oh right @barackobama did that already. seems like you are an expert at copy/paste. first #nafta, no the #aca. #trumpisalaughingstock — the voice of reason (@portarican_rt) august 8, 2020
meanwhile, the trump administration has taken numerous steps to worsen the health insurance market for people with pre-existing conditions.
with democrats out of power in washington, there's been no chance his most ambitious ideas could become law. but there's also clear evidence his proposals have picked up steam among democrats.
trump has said more than once that politically speaking, the easiest choice for republicans would be to sit back and let the system operate on its own. doing so, trump predicted, would lead to a total collapse.
for weeks, democrats have been in an internal policy debate around the issue of health insurance. house democrats' latest relief package included several health care provisions, expanding how much the federal government chips in on medicaid payments, and subsidizing cobra at 100%. in other words, it would have the federal government temporarily foot the bill for the health insurance plans employers were once covering.
republicans have been very busy lying about health care: lying about their policy agenda, lying about democrats calling them liars and lying about who said who was really lying about all this.
as south carolina's feb. 29 democratic primary approaches ― the nomination race's fourth contest in a state where black voters make up the majority of the party's base ― biden's lead in polls has not wavered. it's the state that was hailed as having solidified obama's path to the nomination in 2008, and this year's primary comes just days before super tuesday, when voters in many of the big states — including texas and california — go to the ballot box.
that vow, not to support a plan that pulls the rug out from under people, may sound familiar. it's the same promise republicans kept making in 2017 after donald trump became president and they were trying to write repeal legislation.
statements like these are just rhetoric. but they are consistent with a long-standing approach to policy ― promoted by conservatives, implemented by republicans ― in which protecting the elderly and the frail has been a secondary priority, at best.
and it appears that some of the justice department's own career lawyers feel the same way. right before the trump administration filed its brief, siding with the conservative states, three career lawyers who were supposed to file it withdrew their names from the case, offering an early hint that something was amiss.
some would still get insurance, and if they are young and healthy, they might even be able to get it more cheaply than they do now. but they would likely have less-comprehensive coverage with big gaps in benefits.
making sure people who have pre-existing health conditions don't get screwed by health insurance companies is very popular. so popular that a bunch of republican senators who are freaked out about the party's electoral prospects have introduced legislation to guarantee that no americans may be denied coverage because of their medical history.
when evidence developed that the video trump tweeted may have come from a reddit user who had posted racist comments in the past, that reddit user, name of hansassholesolo, apologized, which prompted paul begala to tweet,if only our president had the conscience and class of hansassholesolo. (disgraceful trump team members including donald trump jr. then riled up the trumposphere with the phony claim that cnn had blackmailed hans.)
an answer barrett gave at her confirmation hearing, when the issue of the affordable care act came up repeatedly, suggests that she too has a traditional view on severability.
a spokesman with the u.s. department of agriculture, which oversees snap, declined to comment.
in truth, one federal district judge ― rudolph contreras ― in 2012 found fault with parts of the gainful employment rule, but that was an earlier, different version of the rule, and the judge nevertheless upheld the authority of the department of education to issue it. after that decision, the department of education undertook a brand-new rule-making process and issued a brand-new gainful employment rule that eliminated the provisions that contreras rejected. when the for-profit college industry then challenged the new rule in court, two other federal district judges and three federal appeals judges all upheld the rule in its entirety. then, last week, judge contreras issued a narrow ruling in yet another industry lawsuit, directing the department to give certain cosmetology programs that had sued more flexibility to file appeals of adverse results, but the judge noted that his order avoids upending the entire ge regulatory scheme.
these short-term plans can be very cheap because they don't end up paying much in the way of medical bills. they reliably draw in healthy people, leaving them exposed to large medical bills if they get sick even, as they force insurers to jack up prices for more comprehensive coverage.
the mandate is meant to encourage healthy people to buy insurance. it makes it possible for insurers to sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and not worry that people will wait until getting sick to enroll. the mandate also makes sure that people without coverage assume some financial responsibility for the charity care they would receive if they needed it.
meanwhile, the affordable care act is actually functioning without a mandate penalty. that's one more reason to preserve the law, as a separate friend-of-the-court brief from several dozen policy experts argues.
republican congressional leaders have essentially given up on repealing obamacare ― at least in this congress. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) made clear earlier this year that he has no intention of leading his conference into another fight over the law, despite trump's vow to turn the gop into the party of health care. the kentucky republican is instead focusing on retaining his majority next year by hammering democrats over medicare for all, a government-run health care proposal he says will put the country on a dangerous path to socialism.
the law's likely overhaul puts many hospitals in a uniquely daunting position of being unable to predict how many of their patients will be insured and what type of coverage they will have in the future. as a result, many are more wary than in years past to invest in expensive capital projects, issue debt, or expand into new regions, said healthcare experts and hospital executives.
but the gambit failed, and it failed spectacularly.
some experts have warned that even hinting about efforts to undermine the mandate could destabilize obamacare's already-fragile insurance markets.
trump's address was also peppered with lies, misstatements and distortions about both his record and biden's positions, many of which were repeated at other points during the convention. going over every last lie would require a herculean effort, but two of them were critical, and trump is likely to repeat them again and again over the final weeks of the race.
a president whose primary health policy objective is scrapping his predecessor's law that brought the uninsured rate to a historic low can't plausibly claim to be fixing the health care system. obamacare is bad is not a policy, and anyone who expected trump to finally, at long last, explain to the public how he would replace that law ― if such a person still exists ― has been disappointed yet again.
they succeeded. the affordable care act, for all of its inadequacies and flaws, helped tens of millions of those americans get care. a big reason republican efforts to repeal the law failed was that it would have rolled back this progress.
and it was telling that neither the state's democratic gubernatorial candidate, state rep. james smith, nor any of the party's house contenders shared the stage with sanders.
you call that whatever the heck you want to call it ― it's not medicare for all, he said tuesday in an interview on cnn.
a highly respected career lawyer at the justice department has decided to resign just days after the trump administration backed a controversial lawsuit that would wreck part of the affordable care act.
sanders speeches in south carolina and iowa reflected this diversified focus. he called the criminal justice system broken and racist, and mused about how hypocritical republicans are who preach small government, except when it comes to women's abortion rights.
almost no legal expert thinks the case has merit
the battle over the soon-to-be law, however, could determine the political future for both parties. democrats are all but certain to lose ground in congress in a 2022 midterm, but limiting those losses could give biden additional opportunities to push progressive policies. republicans, meanwhile, need to pin down an anti-biden message and see if fiscal conservatism resonates with their base and the broader electorate the same way it did a decade ago.
donald trump made a key promise during his presidential campaign to revise the nation's tax code while lowering taxes. however, upon closer examination of his recently released tax proposal, certain groups will benefit, while others may suffer economic harm.
trump is stuck in 1980s new york city
the standard deduction will double, affecting all taxpayers. as the law now stands, single individuals can deduct $6,350 from their taxable income while married couples deduct $12,700. trump proposes that individuals will deduct $12,700 while married couples can write off $25,400. the proposed benefits are that average taxpayers will pay less taxes if they do not have itemized deductions and simplify tax return preparation without the use of an accountant or preparer.
for the first time in history, a congressional committee will be hearing from experts on why every american should have access to quality, affordable healthcare, sponsor of the medicare for all legislation rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) said in a statement. this hearing will continue the momentum for this deeply important issue ― an issue that people have literally been dying over while waiting for congress to resolve ― and will surely be a catalyst for more action to come.
former house speaker newt gingrich and current speaker paul ryan, for example, built their conservative reputations and bases of power with sweeping plans to dismantle the federal safety net, and they have many acolytes. the main difference between those gop leaders and president donald trump is that the latter is even more brazen in his lies about what he plans to do.
i did not vote for you. either time. i have voted republican for the entirety of my life. i proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my republican loyalty. i was very vocal in my opposition to you -- particularly the aca, wrote brent nathan brown of mosinee, wisconsin. i would not be alive without access to care i received due to your law. so thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. thank you for serving me even when i didn't vote for you. brown also introduced obama at the event.
in his speech at the church, biden told a story he would repeat throughout the holiday weekend: that not too long ago a black man picked him up at the train station in wilmington, delaware, and took him to the steps of the capitol in washington to be inaugurated as the vice president of the united states. that man, of course, was barack obama.

the failure to pass the bill represents a devastating defeat for trump and ryan ― and throws into doubt a crusade that has defined republican politics for over seven years.
even the likely targets of bipartisan outreach said that during the course of the entire process they never heard from trump. a spokesman for sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.) said a call never came.
as vice president, biden was reportedly reluctant to pursue obamacare. as a senator, he played a key role in writing and passing policies, such as harsh penalties for drug possession, that led to today's criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes minorities. and he backed the iraq war, while obama's opposition to the invasion was a key issue that propelled him ahead of hillary clinton in the 2008 democratic primary.
sure, premiums wouldn't be allowed to vary based on health status or pre-existing conditions. but prices could dramatically vary based on age, gender, occupation and other factors, including hobbies, in ways that are functionally the same as basing them on medical histories. insurance companies have a lot of experience figuring out that stuff.
among the established gop presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.
obamacare repeal still on the agenda
i say to president (donald) trump that this country has struggled for too many years, for too many centuries in combating racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia, sanders declared. we are not going backwards. we are going forwards ― as one people.
gaffney was actually one of the witnesses that single-payer advocates put forward to testify. but the rules committee nixed his appearance, along with those of more than a dozen other suggested witnesses.
joel mcelvain, outgoing assistant director of the federal programs branch, has spent more than 20 years at the department, much of it working on the biggest cases of the day. a former colleague described mcelvain to huffpost as a really good guy — the type who in any rational or just world would be at doj his entire career.
that effort did not succeed, but as part of their 2017 tax cut, republicans managed to zero out the law's individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance by hitting them with a financial penalty if they don't. the trump administration has also taken a series of executive actions, such as slashing the affordable care act's advertising budget, that have depressed enrollment or otherwise undermined it.
republic report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of president donald j. trump. trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.
the decisions democrats make all across america in the next few days will determine what this party stand for, what we believe and what we will get done, said biden, who was declared the winner of the south carolina primary within a minute of the polls closing saturday night. we have the option of winning big or losing big.
why the health care debate isn't going away
declining government spending would reduce the federal deficit, the cbo predicted in that report, and average premiums for people buying coverage on their own would end up lower than they would have been otherwise. but those lower premiums would be a byproduct of older and sicker people dropping insurance altogether ― because insurers would have made it too pricey for them, and because the plans available on the market would have tended to cover much less.
somebody, it seems, forgot to give candidate donald trump the memo.
editor's note: donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the u.s.
the divisions between the candidates will likely be on display on tuesday and wednesday in detroit for the second presidential debate. sanders and his fellow progressive sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) take the stage the first night, while harris and biden will get a chance to square off against each other on the second night.
but there is no way to be sure, especially because her answer left some observers thinking she might agree with the plaintiffs on the rest of the argument.
psaki said the white house will work to explain the provisions to americans in the jargon-free way biden prefers.
the losers are nancy pelosi and chuck schumer because now they own obamacare, he explained. this is not our bill. this is their bill.
the capital gains tax would be reduced from 23.8 to 20 percent. this reduction comes from the elimination of the 3.8 percent tax that helps fund obamacare applying to investment income over $250,000 for a married couple. this cut is to incentivize investors for increasing investments while minimizing the after-tax liability. treasury secretary steven mnuchin hopes to greatly encourage investments and, in the long and short-term, stimulate economic growth.
this is a shameful decision from the supreme court, said brigitte amiri, deputy director of the aclu reproductive freedom project. denying employees and students coverage for birth control will limit their ability to decide whether and when to have a family and make other decisions about their futures. and it will exacerbate existing inequalities, falling hardest on people with the fewest resources and people of color.
there's great demand that we're concerned about not being able to meet in the future, said burnette.
but james has also run into a familiar political problem for republicans. back in 2017, he called for repealing the affordable care act, describing the law as a monstrosity. now he is under attack for trying to take away the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions.
the problems for the brooklyn-born vermonter didn't end with the 2016 election. his april 2017 decision to campaign for democrat heath mello, an abortion-rights opponent who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of omaha, nebraska, raised eyebrows on the left.
biden ended his speech with one more poignant attack on sanders' lifelong position as an independent in congress, and as a democratic socialist who has been critical of the democratic party.
and in an interview with wzzm-tv, the abc affiliate in grand rapids, james said, i understand firsthand how important it is to protect our family members and people with preexisting conditions. … i will not support any plan that pulls the rug out from under people.
the white house, meanwhile, began planning travel. biden is set to visit pennsylvania next week to sell the bill, while vice president harris will travel to colorado. over the next 10 days, the white house plans to highlight different key aspects of the bill, including halving child poverty and boosting rural health care.
although scientists are still learning about the novel coronavirus and its effects, they have known from the beginning that the groups most likely to suffer severe, life-threatening symptoms are the elderly and people with serious underlying medical conditions.
justices elena kagan and stephen breyer filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.
even that figure doesn't capture the full extent of the consequences from a supreme court decision against the health care law.
this is word salad worthy of sarah palin. even the comprehensible parts don't make sense. allowing insurance sales across state lines, for example, won't enable people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance. if anything, it will have the opposite effect, since some states have historically forced insurers to sell to all comers ― and allowing cross-state purchasing would render those regulations moot. republican schemes to block grant medicaid typically involve reducing the program's funding, which would, according to impartial estimates, vastly reduce the number of people who could get insurance.
washington ― in 2017, now-arizona sen. martha mcsally really, really wanted to repeal obamacare. mcsally, then a congresswoman, reportedly stood up in the middle of a gop conference meeting and urged her colleagues to vote for a bill to gut the signature democratic domestic policy achievement of the past decade, telling them to get this fucking thing done.
at one point, trump suggested that clinton actually preferred to create a single-payer plan ― something that would come as a great shock to sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who proposed a single-payer scheme during the democratic primaries that clinton attacked repeatedly. (trump also suggested that single-payer plans are catastrophic in certain ways, even though those systems actually outperform the u.s. system by at least some metrics, while managing to provide truly universal coverage with significantly lower spending.)
the end of christie's term in office can't come quick enough for the people of new jersey, who currently give the governor a 15 percent approval rating. christie could quickly replace hapless reince priebus (june 15 ranking: 10) as white house chief of staff, assuming priebus is tired of the humiliation at trump's hands, and christie is tanned, rested, and ready for more humiliation at trump's hands.
the incumbent in michigan isn't a republican, however. it's democrat gary peters, a well-liked but not especially well-known former investment adviser who has spent nearly 30 years in politics ― as a city councilor, state senator, lottery commissioner and then a u.s. house member before succeeding democratic sen. carl levin in 2015.
on tuesday, the late show host hammered ryan for declaring how a congressional budget office report estimating up to 24 million people could lose cover under the gop's proposed replacement for obamacare exceeded my expectations.
mcsally is denying her change in tone marks a significant shift ― she said it was fake news when an interviewer asked her about it on friday. but her new rhetoric, which comes after years of support for a full repeal of obamacare and after a vote for a plan that would have increased costs and weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions, is representative of how republican senators up for reelection in 2020 are approaching the law.
former vice president joe biden declared his overwhelming victory in the south carolina primary with a forceful message for democrats: that the party would lose big if sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) won the democratic nomination.
health insurance companies are struggling to make money on the exchanges, leading major players like unitedhealth group to openly contemplate abandoning them. aetna and other firms, in contrast, say they're committed to making the marketplaces work even if they're not immediately profitable. and insurers losing money in the exchange market are eyeing premium increases for next year that could make coverage unaffordable for some portion of those already in the system.
there is nothing on the table to mitigate the vast harm that ruling would create, despite assertions from trump like this: if we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions.
preexisting conditions have to continue to be solved, perdue said. we have to figure out a way that people don't lose their insurance when they lose their job, and then we have to get after the real causes of health care costs.
what exact costs will aetna incur now that the justice department has challenged the merger? what costs will aetna incur if the merger is ultimately blocked?
both parties recognize the stakes, which helps explain why the james-peters race is on track to be the most expensive in the state's history. much of that has gone toward television advertisements that focus on health care ― including one from peters that features a 2017 video of james bemoaning the gop's failure to repeal the affordable care act.
not every 2020 democrat is in the same place on abortion. former vice president joe biden stands out for, for years, supporting the hyde amendment, which prohibits spending federal money (such as medicaid) on abortion services. and after the alabama law passed, he notably tweeted a statement that was noticeably less fiery and outraged than what the other candidates were putting out. but he too seems to be feeling the energy: in early may, he said he no longer supports hyde.
more recently, some prominent republicans have seemed less than concerned about the plight of another vulnerable group in this crisis: workers at meatpacking plants. they, too, would be suffering less with more testing, protective gear, attention to their working conditions and leeway to stay home if they are at higher risk.
health care has become a defining issue of next month's midterm elections, and republicans across the country, including president donald trump, are promising voters that they care deeply about protecting people with pre-existing conditions.
for weeks, biden has been making the case that his candidacy would be the most strategic for democrats, particularly that he can help democrats win down the ballot in competitive house and senate races. he has also argued that sanders' democratic socialism is too big a risk for the party.
these steps include dramatic cuts in funding for enrollment outreach and promotion, as well as a change in federal regulations that will allow people to hold on to limited-benefit, short-term plans for nearly three years. that change, along with repeal of the individual mandate's financial penalty for people who don't have comprehensive coverage, makes these short-term plans a more viable alternative for people.
6. jeff sessions, attorney general. last week's ranking: 7
the reality is that republicans have never produced alternatives to obamacare that live up to their lofty rhetoric. they didn't in 2017 and they aren't now.
but ― as huffpost's jeffrey young pointed out on sunday ― most people facing increases will be able to switch to cheaper plans, and of course millions will get tax credits that amount to huge discounts. that's little consolation to the millions who don't get big tax credits, but, as a recent analysis from the urban institute pointed out, on average the plans the law makes available are not more expensive than the ones employers provide employees. if anything, they are a little cheaper.
the only thing he could do to piss me off is to stop being trump, said innis, arguing that, with an immense sense of brilliance and strategy trump picked mike pence as his vice president precisely for those who wanted political vanilla. if [trump] isn't that non-nonsense pit bull that he is, then i would be upset. then i'd be like, 'ummm. we don't want that.'
the alabama law, in particular, was a wake-up call for many people. it goes further even than what some republicans and abortion opponents support, because it doesn't have the rape and incest exceptions.
the republican party's assault on the affordable care act continued monday as the trump administration found yet another way to undermine the law's insurance rules.
trump's plan also increases the federal budget deficit and the national debt. the plan trump has proposed, which was set out as a one-page proposal without any financial justification to back it up, never stated anything at all about how the federal budget will be impacted nor how the national debt either increases or decreases. according to the analysts from the tax policy center, federal revenue is estimated to decrease by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years. the trump economic team should hope that there will be the 4 percent economic growth they projected that will make up for the federal revenue decrease. but if there is a recession or economic downturn, then trump's proposal will suffer serious consequences.
government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost, she posted on her facebook page. and who will suffer the most when they ration care? the sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.
still, biden's ability to cite the first black president as his close personal friend poses perhaps the biggest challenge to the other candidates in south carolina. to make inroads in the state, biden's competitors have to effectively pull the former vice president away from obama. on paper, it's not difficult to make that point by noting biden's long record in government — one that was far more conservative than obama's on issues like criminal justice reform, health care and national security.
he's close to obama and he believes in the same traditional things obama believed in and that's my number one priority, said jermaine edwards, 36, of orangeburg.
since shortly after trump took office, his administration and the gop congress have taken a variety of actions to weaken the affordable care act and its health insurance exchanges in particular.
some polling shows younger black voters have been more receptive to the policy message from candidates. a washington post/ipsos poll in early january showed biden polling at 48% with black voters and sanders second with 20% support, driven primarily by supporters under the age of 35. but even that poses its own electoral hurdle; in 2008, a year known for its focus on young voters, voters under the age of 29 made up just 14% of the electorate in the south carolina democratic primary.
as with past weeks, presiding over pruitt's assault on the environment, the gop congress's assault on health care, devos's assault on students, and other policy outrages hasn't been enough for donald j. trump, who must always deliver his own personal brand of kleptocratic, misogynistic, narcissistic, and putinistic disgracefulness.
staff for susan collins referred huffpost to previous comments the maine senator made to bangor daily news that she was disappointed in president donald trump for not allowing a special enrollment period for the affordable care act, but did not comment on congress taking further action on health care specifically.
the new figures hhs published thursday show the uninsured rate improved across racial and ethnic groups.
pretty scary! and totally untrue. completely, 100 percent false. zero correspondence with reality. but mccaughey's nonsense took off. she made the same claim in op-eds for the wall street journal and the new york post. when sarah palin picked up the idea, the mandatory meetings morphed into obama's death panel. conservative media and republican politicians went wild.
bossert is in charge of defending americans against violence ― not lavishing praise on trump when he broadcasts a violent revenge fantasy against our country's free press. disgraceful.
it might not be fear, vaughan said. it might be fewer people.
two key areas of trump's tax plan are the repeals of the alternative minimum tax (amt) and the estate tax. the amt requires individuals with a high number of deductions to calculate the amount owed in taxes under the normal rate and the alternative and ultimately pay the higher amount. while the amt was intended to rid huge deductions by wealthy taxpayers, according to the tax policy center, approximately 5 million people are now affected. the elimination of the estate tax would allow inheritances of $5.5 million for individuals and couples with estates over $11 million to transfer tax free.
the kaiser family foundation estimates there are 5.7 million people who are not eligible for financial subsidies under obamacare, and who would have to pay for the entirety of their private insurance plan. cobra too is cost-prohibitive for many families. the average monthly cost for individual coverage in an employer-sponsored plan is $490, amounting to nearly $6,000 a year — a steep cost for someone without an income.
2. scott pruitt, environmental protection agency administrator. last week's ranking: 3
and, hogue said, the supreme court can also be swayed by public opinion.
given that shift in the trump administration's policy-making lineup and iran's threat to resume its nuclear program should the united states re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel in their white house visits this week has been to persuade trump to remain in the agreement.
back in march, this epidemiological reality prompted dan patrick, the republican lieutenant governor of texas and a prominent trump supporter, to suggest that risking the health of people in his generation (he just turned 70) was a worthwhile price for allowing businesses to return to operating normally.
al diaz/miami herald via getty images donald trump named a woman to his economic advisory team who has repeatedly lied about public policy proposals.
rebecca cook/reuters republican john james, who is running for the u.s. senate from michigan, once called the affordable care act a monstrosity. he has not offered details on how he would replace it.
she raised her hand when asked whether she would abolish private insurance during the first democratic presidential debate in miami in late june, but subsequently disavowed the remark, claiming she had misheard the question.

last year's cut forced navigators to lay off staff, cancel events, and, in some cases, cease operations altogether. this new cut will leave navigators with just a fraction of the money they had available for the open enrollment periods that occurred during president barack obama's administration ― in all likelihood hampering their ability to help consumers through the complicated process of choosing a health insurance policy and applying for financial assistance.
voters' support for abortion rights is at a record high, said cecile richards, the former head of planned parenthood who recently co-founded supermajority, a group devoted to women's political power. meanwhile, we're seeing the most extreme attacks on those rights since roe v. wade more than 40 years ago. .... women are voting in record numbers, donating in record numbers, sharing their stories, and organizing. women are becoming the most powerful political force in america, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020.
sen. bob casey (d-pa.), meanwhile, said he believes the better approach is relying on more incremental proposals like medicare at 50, which would allow americans 50 and older to buy into the medicare program, to expand the health insurance market.
democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it, take on the nra and manufacturers, not protect them, stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and not keep the promises, biden said, taking aim at sanders' signature plan to move every american to a single government-run health insurance plan and the senator's votes in the early 2000s in favor of protecting gun companies from lawsuits.
aside from sanders' pledge, however, the speech served as an implicit rebuttal to biden and other democrats who have adopted conservative talking points in their efforts to discredit sanders' plan.
the message nextgen is deploying, however, is surprisingly simple. the best way to get young voters eager to pull the lever for a 77-year-old they overwhelmingly rejected in favor of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) during the presidential primaries is to point out his agreement with them on a host of issues. the ads don't make grandiose arguments about how biden will unite the country but instead argue he's the best bet for progress on issues younger adults care about.
more moderate members, many of them from democratic-leaning states and states that used affordable care act money to expand medicaid, worried that the bill would take away insurance coverage from too many people ― and that, if premiums really did come down, they would do so only by increasing out-of-pocket costs for people who held on to their coverage.
king, along with sanders campaign co-chair and former ohio state sen. nina turner and activist philip agnew, spent this past weekend going to barbershops and universities to rally black voters for sanders.
then, deploying his trademark sarcasm, sanders panned the logic of republicans and some democrats who defend the current payment system.
when asked about the early signs of hospitals putting spending on hold, a white house spokesperson expressed confidence that the disastrous obamacare law will be replaced with the american health care act — the vehicle which will reform our broken healthcare system.
i think that there were mistakes in many corners from the beginning of the process, rep. justin amash (r-mich.) told the huffington post on friday. the responsible thing to do is keep legislating. my reaction is that when something fails, you keep trying.
now let's talk about what trump and his party are doing.
making it easier to see hospital prices and giving consumers more choices might or might not improve health care access at the margins, but it's not a substitute for the structure the affordable care act has put into place.
and wouldn't you know it? it's the same crowd that was screaming about the specter of death panels a decade ago.
what steps did aetna take, prior to july 2016, to mitigate the risk that the justice department would challenge or successfully block its proposed acquisition of humana?
we want to know what will happen with the medicaid expansion population, and what will be the timeline for that, said peg burnette, denver health's chief financial officer. due to theuncertainty, we're not going to issue new debt. we have no plans for that in the near future.
it's word of mouth, whatever their friends tell them, they take it as, 'it's going to happen to me,' delcid said. and a lot of them are saying, 'don't apply for benefits, you'll get deported.' we try to explain to them, 'that's not how it works.' but they just don't want to renew their benefits any more. they want them to expire.
behind a belief in the necessity of bipartisanship was a faith that it was possible ― a notion that didn't seem as preposterous then as it does now.
health care policy is all about tradeoffs, so for all these changes, there would be countereffects, including a reduction in taxes on the wealthy that the affordable care act raised to finance its coverage expansions.
the dreaded trial didn't happen! another anti-climax. hurray! bring 'em on. nothing like dashed expectations in a gorgeous setting to get the heart racing.
nextgen's announcement comes one day after the biden campaign unveiled a new youth outreach effort, dubbed league 46. that effort, led by biden senior adviser symone sanders, includes an expansion of an existing students for biden group, along with the launch of groups of young professionals for biden and young elected officials for biden.
how trump plotted to kill obamacare
but here too it is easy to forget another reality of 2009 politics, one still very relevant today: the big pressure to compromise came from conservative democrats who had leverage to kill legislation if they wanted. in the senate, this was a function of the same small-state bias that gave republicans outsized power, and as a practical matter, it meant that democratic leaders were constantly trying to satisfy senators from places like arkansas and nebraska where voters were especially suspicious of big new federal programs and prone to believing conservative propaganda about what proposed legislation would do.
but that chance never came, because republicans focused on repeal and, at times, trying to sabotage the program outright. think about medicare, obama said. that was a big political fight, but once it got passed, everybody moved on and tried to make it work. bush's drug benefit program, right? it was a contentious issue. but once it got passed, even those democrats who had opposed it tried to make it work.
the republican-proposed bill, set to come before the u.s. house of representatives on thursday for a vote, would unwind the medicaid expansion, cap federal payments to states and replaceobamacare's income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits. the bill would still need approval in the senate if it clears the house this week.
associated press democratic presidential candidate, sen. kamala harris, d-calif., speaks during the national urban league conference, friday, july 26, 2019, in indianapolis.
what someone promises to do doesn't mean a whole lot, huffmon said. now primary voters tend to be more educated on the issues, and more passionate, but a lot of voters do retrospective voting. in the past they judged obama as good, and that's who they trusted and biden is linked to him.
we will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources. jodi ray, project director for florida covering kids and families
other democrats noted the stimulus was passed before the rise of super pacs and other well-funded outside groups with the capacity to spend millions promoting a law. both house and senate democrats have affiliated nonprofits that can promote the rescue act in key states and districts, and build back together ― a nonprofit aiming to boost biden's agenda ― is expected to come online soon.
washington -- twenty million previously uninsured people have gained health coverage since the affordable care act became law in 2010, president barack obama said during a speech in milwaukee thursday.
sanders' september 2017 single-payer health care legislation received the support of about one-third of the senate democratic caucus; even former president barack obama has praised the underlying policy. and as sanders is fond of noting on the stump, 70 percent of americans say they support medicare for all, according to a reuters poll in august.
gardner has justified that claim by pointing to the pre-existing conditions protection act, a bill he sponsored. but the entire legislation is barely 100 words long and is basically just a slogan, as multiple analysts pointed out.
no, it did not — although, contrary to what some republicans say now, it was not for democrats' lack of effort. in addition to believing in bipartisanship as a virtue, obama could count votes, especially in the senate, where a small-state bias gave conservative states disproportionate power ― and where the filibuster was becoming a de facto, 60-vote requirement for all legislation.
the 2015 deal obama's state department reached with iran forced that nation to dismantle its nuclear enrichment program for at least a decade in return for the suspension of some economic sanctions. the deal's other signatories include france, the united kingdom and germany, as well as the european union, russia and china.
