dear amy: due to a job layoff last year, our 32-year-old daughter has been living with my husband and me. she recently returned to work, but receives a low salary and has no health insurance.
she has a gluten intolerance, which requires meals without wheat and other additives. she refuses to eat the difficult-to-find and expensive gluten-free meals i purchase, accept any money or use the microwave. the food she purchases is scanty.
she appears emaciated but is adamant — without benefit of medical advice — that her weight is normal. she even pointed out that a certain model was skinny, although the model appeared to be heavier than she is. she became irate when i questioned the comparison.
my husband feels that as an adult she can make her own decisions. i believe that she is rebelling against her need to return home at her age. what can we do before she is hospitalized for anorexia?
your husband may not understand that if your daughter has an eating disorder, the disease will be calling the shots. disordered eating trumps mature adult behavior. anorexia is a pernicious illness that intensifies with time; professional treatment and specialized therapy are important.
your daughter's eating issues may have been triggered by her health problems. underlying depression brought on by her personal and professional challenges could be a factor, too. anorexia is an expression of a person's need to control a very basic aspect of her life when other things may seem out of control, but the lack of basic nutrition can make her ability to cope with other life challenges worse. be honest, gentle and loving toward your daughter when discussing her eating issues. don't judge or shame her.
please urge your daughter to see a doctor and a nutritionist, if possible. the national eating disorders association offers helpful tools for loved ones — you can communicate with a counselor through the website or join their parent, family & friends network: nationaleatingdisorders.org.
dear amy: about a year ago, my younger brother (who is an alcoholic) called me to talk. we have rarely been in touch by phone or in person for nearly 35 years, due to me moving more than 2,000 miles away. during the course of our conversation, chuck told me that he had been seeing a therapist. he said, i've finally found out what my problem is. i asked him what that is. he yelled into the phone, my problem is you! he continued to berate me until he slammed the phone down. i haven't had any communication with him since.
i have had therapy for my own problems with alcohol, and have learned that a true alcoholic (i consider myself one, but have been sober for three years) normally blames other people for their own problems. and it's inconceivable that i'' am the root of my brother's anger.
according to my siblings, chuck has alienated every friend and most family members with his behavior. this includes drinking and taking valium. he has blocked all my emails, will not answer any phone calls and rejects any attempt i make to contact him. he is stubborn and obviously has this progressive disease, yet he will not seek treatment. his other belief is also classic for an alcoholic — he thinks he can control his drinking.
i'm at a loss as to how to help him. his blaming me for his own serious problems keeps him from discussing anything with me. i don't like his behavior, but i love him and don't want him to die. any ideas?
you have learned a lot about alcoholism through your own experience and research. and now you need to absorb the biggest challenge of a family member of an alcoholic: the serenity to accept your own powerlessness in getting him to change.
at this point, you need to manage your own feelings about this relationship and the episodes that led to the estrangement. in addition to maintaining your own sobriety, you should sit in the chairs with other adults who struggle with a loved one's drinking, through attendance at an al-anon support group (al-anon.org).
dear amy: thank you for your ongoing support for literacy through your book on every bed holiday campaign.
this is the fifth year my husband and i have done this with our children, and starting christmas morning with a wrapped book on their beds has become a treasured family tradition.
this makes me very happy. thank you.
this sequel to the female eunuch is the book i said i would never write. i believed that each generation should produce its own statement of problems and priorities, and that i had no special authority or vocation to speak on behalf of women of any but my own age, class, background and education. for 30 years, i have done my best to champion all the styles of feminism that came to public attention. though i disagreed with some of the strategies and was troubled by some of the more fundamental conflicts, it was not until feminists of my own generation began to assert with apparent seriousness that feminism had gone too far that the fire flared up in my belly. when the lifestyle feminists chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the right to have it all—i.e., money, sex and fashion—it would have been inexcusable to remain silent. in 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, women's lib. when the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved. what none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. we were settling for equality. liberation struggles are not about assimilation, but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination.
women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. the female eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. at a debate in oxford, one william j. clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. in the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult. the career woman does not know if she is to do her job like a man, or like herself. is she supposed to change the organisation, or knuckle under to it? is she supposed to endure harassment, or kick ass and take names?
is motherhood a privilege or a punishment? it is now understood that women can do anything that men can do: anyone who tries to stop them will be breaking the law. even the president of the united states, the most powerful person in the world, can be called to account by a female nobody who accuses him of asking her to fellate him. power indeed! the future is female, we are told. feminism has served its purpose and should now eff off. feminism was long hair, dungarees and dangling earrings; post-feminism was business suits, big hair and lipstick; post-post-feminism was ostentatious sluttishness and disorderly behaviour. we all agree that women should have equal pay for equal work, be equal before the law, do no more housework than men do, spend no more time with children than men do. or do we? if the future is men and women dwelling as images of each other in a world unchanged, it is a nightmare. in the female eunuch, i argued that every girl child is conceived as a whole woman but, from the time of her birth to her death, she is progressively disabled. a woman's first duty to herself is to survive this process, then to recognise it, then to take measures to defend herself against it. for years after the female eunuch was written, i travelled the earth to see if i could glimpse a surviving whole woman.
she would be a woman who did not exist to embody male sexual fantasies or rely upon a man to endow her with identity and social status; a woman who did not have to be beautiful, who could be clever, who would grow in authority as she aged. i gazed at women in segregated societies and found them in many ways stronger than women who would not go into a theatre or a restaurant without a man. osage women in oklahoma, and anmatyerre and pitjantjatara women in central australia, taught me about survival. no sooner had i caught sight of the whole woman than western marketing came blaring down upon her with its vast panoply of spectacular effects, strutting and trumpeting the highly seductive gospel of salvation according to hipless, wombless, hard-titted barbie. my strong women thrust their muscular feet into high heels and learned to totter; they stuffed their useful breasts into brassieres and, instead of mothers' milk, fed commercial formulae made up with dirty water to their children; they spent their tiny store of cash on lipstick and nail varnish, and were made modern. while western feminists were valiantly contending for a key to the executive washroom, the feminine stereotype was completing her conquest of the world. this insidious process was floated on the lie of the sexual revolution. along with spurious equality and flirty femininity, we were sold sexual freedom. one man's sexual freedom is another man's—or woman's or child's—sexual thraldom.
in february 1997, a national opinion poll found that nearly seven out of 10 women feel political parties do not pay sufficient attention to issues of importance to women. these women would not answer to the description of feminist, but if feminism is the consciousness of women's oppression, they were not afraid to display it. even now, women may enter political institutions only after those institutions have formed them in the institutional mould; the more female politicians a parliament may boast, the less likely it is to address women's issues. prime minister blair has less trouble keeping his party under an unprecedented degree of central control because so many of the labour mps are inexperienced, young and female. a male labour mp called them the stepford wives with a chip inserted in their brain to keep them on message; the media call them blair's babes. few of the silly rituals of the house have been abolished, nor has the parliamentary timetable been modified. after a year in the rowdy bear-garden that is the british house of commons, and many weeks without seeing their families for more than a few minutes at a time, the new women mps were reporting levels of stress approaching the unbearable. changes in british legislation have been slow and tentative, commitment to the economic enfranchisement of women more apparent than real. a woman is now slightly more likely to find a job than a man, entirely because of the restructuring of the job market in the employer's favour.
the workers who will accept a zero-hours contract, which means that they are only called upon if business is brisk and then paid an hourly rate, who will carry pagers and mobile phones and be at the employer's beck and call 24 hours a day, who take work home every night, who have no job protection or guarantee of safe and hygienic conditions or insurance against work-related injury, are women. prestige and power have seeped out of professions as women joined them. teaching is already rock-bottom; medicine is sliding fast. though they are close to parity in numbers, the total earned by british women is only 60 percent of what men earn; their pay hour by hour is 79 pence for every pound earned by a man. the differential between women's pay and men's pay has now been enshrined. a woman who brings a case before an employment tribunal will wait for years before a decision will be reached; a decision in a single case is simply that. british equal pay legislation is legislation meant to be ineffective, designed to be ineffective. women are discriminated against by building societies, who treat maternity leave as long-term sick leave and will not lend to couples with both partners in work if the woman is pregnant. women pay 50 percent more for medical insurance. women are the stomping ground of medical technology, routinely monitored, screened and tortured, to no purpose except the enactment of control.
they have been punished for their acquisition of a modicum of economic independence by being left with virtually total responsibility for the welfare of children, while gangs of professionals perpetually assess and record their inadequacies. idealisation of the mother has been driven out by criminalisation of the mother. our culture is far more masculinist than it was thirty years ago. movies deal with male obsessions. soccer is britain's most significant cultural activity. computer use is spreading into every home, but more than 80 percent of internet users are male. women are ignored by manufacturers of video games, which are mostly war games of one sort or another. popular music is split as never before; the consumers of commercial pop are female; the rock music that appeals to men is deliberately, unbelievably and outrageously misogynist. while women were struggling to live as responsible dignified adults, men have retreated into extravagantly masculinist fantasies and behaviours. every day, terrible revenges are enacted on women who have dared to use their new privileges. female military recruits are sexually abused and harassed, young policewomen subjected to degrading ordeals, and hideous brutality inflicted on women apparently simply because they are female. on every side, we see women troubled, exhausted, lonely, guilty, mocked by the headlined success of the few. the reality of women's lives is work—most of it unpaid and, what is worse, unappreciated.
every day, we hear of women abused; every day, we hear of new kinds of atrocities perpetrated on the minds and bodies of women; yet every day, we are told that there is nothing left to fight for. even if it had been real, equality would have been a poor substitute for liberation; fake equality is leading women into double jeopardy. the rhetoric of equality is being used in the name of political correctness to mask the hammering that women are taking. when the female eunuch was written, our daughters were not cutting or starving themselves. on every side, speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners. it's time to get angry again.
greer on adultery it seems there is never any shortage of women who will commit adultery with married men, and that even women who call themselves feminist are perfectly willing to marry a man who has already rendered a wife or two acutely miserable. women are all too ready still to accept a man's view of his relations with women, and to understand men whose wives, with much longer and closer experience, don't understand them. when women are ready to believe that a man's saying my wife doesn't understand me means i behave unreasonably towards my wife, feminism will have got to first base. one wife is all any man deserves.
greer on the tyranny of housework by the millennium, housework should have been abolished. in a sane world, meaningless repetition of non-productive activity would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder. people who said that they enjoyed doing housework, or needed to do it, or that doing it made them feel good would be known as addicts. once the word got out that a person was cleaning her toilet every day, therapists would come to her house and reclaim her for rationality and the pleasure principle. instead, we have professor jean-claude kaufman of the sorbonne telling us that housework is a deeply sensual experience—for women, that is, not for himself. women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy. according to him, rhythmic, repetitive, mindless tasks function as sexual anticipation, building up pleasurable tension until it climaxes in conjugal relations. faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet.
these days, housework doesn't just use people; it requires a gang of machines: vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, driers, food processors, microwave ovens, refrigerators and freezers, immense quantities of water, power and detergent to feed into them, and an army of technicians who treat them when they malfunction—and charge more than doctors do for a home visit. though the houseworker doesn't now scrub and polish floors or pound clothes on a washboard or put aside an evening for ironing, she is equally busy hoovering, spraying-and-wiping and stuffing clothes in washing machines. as more and more home appliances have appeared in more and more homes, they have brought anything but increased leisure for the houseworker (who probably also has to earn the money to pay for them). changing standards and notions of cleanliness have made cleaning more time-consuming than ever before. kitchen worktops need to be constantly wiped; kitchen floors need to be mopped whenever a footprint or a pawprint appears; the bath has to be cleaned between baths; once a day is not often enough for the toilet. every few minutes, a television commercial illustrates the standard and shows a way of achieving it, tightening the headlock on the housewife. a recent television commercial for bold laundry detergent opened with a mid-shot of a slender, good-looking, but not too good-looking, woman. a door opens behind her and a schoolboy rushes in. hi, darren, she says. he does not answer. she answers herself, hi, mum. darren enters bedroom, looks surprised.
she says, thanks for tidying my room, mum. he rips off his school shirt, grabs a fresh shirt from neatly folded pile (the inference being that he is immediately going out again). as the neatly ironed shirt billows out, a special effect signifies the effects of bold. mum says, thanks for washing my shirt, mum. no response. then she says, i know you appreciate me, really. darren smirks at himself in mirror, like any snotnose git with a doormat mother. this commercial would have been shown to a focus group of housewives at the story-board stage, and again before it was transmitted. they must have responded positively to this version of doting motherhood as the training of a tyrant, or the commercial would never have gone to air. even as feminism is trying to transform attitudes, marketing is obliterating its traces. in commercial after commercial, the performer of mindless routine tasks is an inanely smiling woman, unless some inanely smiling man pops up to demonstrate a new and better way of using even more of the product by dint of making her look a complete fool. a mythical battle has to be waged by the houseworker against germs, depicted as intelligent beings of deviant appearance lurking under the rim of the toilet ready to infect helpless kiddies if the houseworker should be so remiss as to allow a single one to survive.
there are more germs in her mouth and under her fingernails and in her hair than there are under the rim of the toilet, but the houseworker is not told this. her vocation is to rid the world of germs with the aid of a knight in shining armour, a genie in a bottle, a white tornado. this is housework as heroic exploit. the houseworker can only know that she has done her duty when she has squirted bleach-based agents into every nook and cranny of her house, even down the drains. houses no longer smell of cooking; they smell of cleaning. yet kitchens are not operating theatres and antisepsis in kitchens is as undesirable as it is impossible, because it can only be achieved by huge overuse of powerful chemicals. millennial food preparation takes less time than the old methods; the time spent getting food on and off the table has shrunk by a third, but it must not be thought the houseworker has more leisure time as a result. housework expands to fill the time available. time not spent doing one task will be taken up by another. washing used to be done on a single day of the week, usually monday. when washing machines became cheap enough to be owned by the majority, washing came gradually to be done on any day of the week, and then on every day of the week. laundry is nowadays done several times a day.
television commercials show beaming women snatching a single soiled garment from the back of husband or child, and producing it blazing clean minutes later, having been through the whole washing and drying process aided by a horde of sophisticated bio-digesters, enzymes and whitening agents as well as immense amounts of power and water, all squandered on a single garment. kids won't wear their jeans and t-shirts for more than a few hours each before into the machine they go. the person who does all this work is usually female. advertisers and market researchers who tried to buck the stereotype and show men spraying harpic under the rim of the toilet very soon realised their mistake. nowadays, it is always a woman who pops the meal in the microwave, whips off her apron, uncorks the wine, lights the candles and waits. there is no magazine called man and home. the 23 percent of men who will consent to cook when they have a woman in the house do so on special occasions with great song and dance, leaving the clearing up to be done by her. men who clean and wash are presumed to have a wife in hospital. the few men who do a hand's turn around the house expect gratitude and recognition, so sure are they that, though it is their dirt, it is not their job. work around the house is as gendered as ever it was.
men have not agreed to do a share, let alone a fair share, of domestic work, because they have never agreed on the amount of work that needs to be done. it is difficult to know how they could, because most of the work done in the home does not need to be done. the men who leave ziggurats of dirty dishes festering in the sink are actually involved in a power play which they have no intention of losing. all they need to do is to exploit inertia, and wait it out. sooner or later, the woman will give in, because the squalor is not held against the menfolk but against her. a man who is slovenly and untidy is considered normal; the woman who is, either a slut or a slommack or a sloven or a slag. the external attribute becomes a moral quality, as it does not for a man. this works both ways; a house-proud woman equates her spotless house with her virtuous self and derives her sense of self-worth from the orderliness of her cupboards, rather than qualities of her mind or soul. the only way to escape this tyranny of housework is to abandon the house. you can live with nomads or hunter-gatherers, maybe, or become a nun with nothing but a cell to distract you from the day-long excitement of prayer. or maybe you can make a vow that no more than an hour in any day may be spent on housework—and keep it.
this really would be the end of civilisation as we know it.
greer on marriage some of the briefest marriages are those that follow a long period of cohabitation. nobody quite knows why this is so, but the theory is that unforced cohabitation is less oppressive than sanctioned cohabitation. marriage does make a difference; even when the marriage service does not contain the bride's pledge to love, honour and obey, it acts in the interest of a husband rather than a wife. though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. his friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. the dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. as both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. she sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy.
the less she expected it, the more generous he feels for having done it. to her anxious question do you love me? he has an easy answer. of course. i married you, didn't i? the interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. a man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. a wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. this fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise.
greer on sex and the singly woman out of 3.8 million british women in their thirties, almost a million are single or divorced. not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. there is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. the power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. as a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. the constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. it is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. so let this feminist say it again: no sex is better than bad sex. bad sex is bad for you. looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous. making yourself available can mean putting yourself in jeopardy. no sex does you no harm at all.
as many a sole woman out there knows, being single and free is bliss compared to the misery inflicted by an unfair partner, good though the sex may have been. besides, the things you want don't tend to turn up until you have given over looking for them.
greer on body image show me a woman who loves her body every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful. she also knows that whatever beauty she has is leaving her, stealthily, day by day. even if she is as freakishly beautiful as the supermodels whose images she sees replicated all around her until they are more familiar than the features of her own mother, she cannot be beautiful enough. there must be bits of her that will not do: her knees, her feet, her buttocks, her breasts. however much body hair she has, it is too much. however little and sweetly she sweats, it is too much. left to her own devices, she is sure to smell bad. if her body is thin enough, her breasts are sad. if her breasts are full, her arse is surely too big. what is pathological behaviour in a man is required of a woman. a bald man who wears a wig is a ridiculous figure; a bald woman who refuses to wear a wig is being stroppy and confrontational. women with too much (i.e., any) body hair are expected to struggle daily with depilatories of all kinds in order to appear hairless. scientists call abnormal preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's appearance body dysmorphic disorder, or bdd. yet no one would say that the woman who puts herself through the agonising ordeal of hot-waxing her bikini-line must be suffering from bdd.
such insecurity has been instilled into women over generations; we have made not the least headway in the struggle to dispel it. every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. when the female eunuch has written, cellulite was a french disease. the english word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as british pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for french products, they adopted the french word. cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. it keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. the characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever.
no cream, whether made of placenta or the brains of aborted fetuses or ground glass, will break down cellulite. your cellulite is you, and will be with you till death or liposuction, which is expensive and extremely painful and sometimes more disfiguring than the dimply fat itself. as fat distribution is hormonally regulated, the fat will probably build up again gradually after liposuction. as cellulite will neither kill you nor go away, it is a goldmine for doctors, nutritionists, naturopaths, aromatherapists, fitness experts and lifestyle managers. the manufacturers of creams, exercise equipment, skin brushes and dietary supplements all make a bundle out of women's carefully cultivated disgust with their own bodies, scarfed about as they are by unsightly fat cells. criminalising cellulite is just another way of demonising fat, any fat, anywhere. as a way of inducing them to buy products of no use or value, women have been deliberately infected with bdd. conditions that practically all women suffer from are spoken of as unsightly and abnormal, to make women feel that parts of their bodies, perhaps their whole bodies, are defective and should be worked on, even surgically altered. most women think that their hair is not good enough and dye it or bleach it or perm it. most women feel that their legs are not long enough, that their thighs are too heavy or not firm enough. most women are unhappy about their bottoms, which are either too flat, too low-slung, too fat or too broad.
preoccupation about her appearance goes some way towards ruining some part of every women's day. multi-million-dollar industries exploit both her need for reassurance and her need to do something about the way she looks. thirty years ago, it was enough to look beautiful; now a woman has to have a tight, toned body, including her buttocks and thighs, so that she is good to touch, all over. remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. demi moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. she also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. the result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. the fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory. the uk beauty industry takes ú8-9 billion a year out of women's pockets. magazines financed by the beauty industry teach little girls that they need make-up and train them to use it, so establishing their lifelong reliance on beauty products.
not content with showing pre-teens how to use foundations, powders, concealers, blushers, eye-shadows, eye-liners, lip-liners, lipstick and lip gloss, the magazines identify problems of dryness, flakiness, blackheads, shininess, dullness, blemishes, puffiness, oiliness, spots, greasiness, that little girls are meant to treat with moisturisers, fresheners, masks, packs, washes, lotions, cleansers, toners, scrubs, astringents—none of which will make the slightest difference and all of which would cost money the child does not have. pre-teen cosmetics are relatively cheap but, within a few years, more sophisticated marketing will have persuaded the most level-headed young woman to throw money away on alchemical preparations containing anything from silk to cashmere, pearls, proteins, royal jelly, placenta extracts, ceramides, biotin, collagen, phytotensers, bisabolol, jojoba, hydra-captors, serine, fruit hydroxy-acids, oleospheres, corneospheres, nanovectors, glycerol—anything real or phony that might fend off her imminent collapse into hideous decrepitude. yet consumer research regularly reports that nothing applied to the surface of the skin can affect the underlying structures or prevent aging, and still the anti-aging products sell. every day, hospitals put placenta into special freezers to be collected once a week by unmarked vans and sold to face-cream manufacturers. so desperate are some women to stave off aging that they are prepared to submit to injections of botulin toxin to freeze their facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. what is truly depressing about the false dawn of feminism is that, as we have been congratulating ourselves on largely imaginary victories, bdd has become a global pandemic.
women who were unselfconscious and unmade-up 30 years ago, who walked at a natural pace and worked alongside men in the fields and the factories, are now infected. in provincial cities in china, hanging up over shop doorways, you can see boards with padded brassieres pinned all over them, and trays of cheap lacquer and lipstick under fly-spotted glass, so that women who are naturally small-breasted can assume the new shape. beauty salons crimp and curl shining hair with a fall like silk into shapeless frizz. the two billion people worldwide who regularly view baywatch are all recognising a single, tawdry, synthetic kind of skinnied-down, pumped-up, bleached and depilated female beauty. real girls tell me that when they run along the beach, their male companions make fun of their real breasts that bounce up and down—unlike the rigid half-tennis-ball boobs of the baywatch babes. who cares that pamela anderson, who has been put together out of all the movable parts of male and female fetishism, has been abused by her husband? we are selling fantasy here.
greer on barbie it seemed, a quarter of a century ago, that the days of the barbie doll were numbered. barbie was descended from a swimsuit-clad german porno-toy called lilli—a 12-inch peroxided nymph with a sidelong glance, designed to be sold to men in tobacconists' shops. at her american debut in the spring of 1959, barbie was the first toy to be directly marketed to three- to 11-year-old girls on saturday morning television. american girls now own eight barbies apiece, british girls six. with her non-functional body, boasting a nipple-free bosom more than twice the circumference of her minute waist, legs twice as long as her torso, and feet so tiny that she cannot stand on them, barbie is unlikely to have been very effective in her career roles as astronaut, vet or stewardess. every year, barbie gets 120 new outfits, including a range of sexy underwear, and a new career. she has 35 pets, as well as a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. she is put together by 11,000 chinese peasant women in two factories in guangdong province; 23p of the total price of a barbie doll is payment for their labour. sales last year topped $1.2 billion. more than one billion barbies have been sold since 1959; she is brand leader in every one of the 140 countries where she is sold.
in 1998, a makeover was announced; the millennial barbie is to stand on flat feet, her bosom and hips are to be slightly reduced and her waist slightly enlarged, but she will still be a far cry from action woman. even so, a u.s. columnist objected, why not just give her a moustache, cellulite and varicose veins too? the further from the natural a female form, the more attractive it becomes. the further from the natural a female form, the more feminine it is. barbie has been instrumental in teaching broad-shouldered women, short-legged women, wide-bodied women, real women the world over, to despise their bodies as we do, so that they pay out money that could be put towards the cost of books or computers or bicycles, for cheaply produced, expensively packaged beauty products.
greer in abortion feminism is supposed to be pro-abortion. there are some who fancy that feminists used to march shouting, what do we want? abortion! when do we want it? we want it now! those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. this is not what happened. in the united states, the crucial factor was a decision in the supreme court in the case of roe v. wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. jane roe or norma mccorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young texas lawyer. she has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the u.s. the decision in roe v. wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of roe v. wade is called into question.
what women won was the right to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies—unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept students with children. historically, the only thing pro-abortion agitation achieved was to make an illiberal establishment look far more feminist than it was. the abortionists who went to prison in the run-up to legalisation for helping girls in trouble were all male. all saw themselves as champions of women and defenders of women's rights. they were repaid with the love and loyalty of women, who were grateful for the right to expiate their sexual activity in pain and grief. the goal was every child a wanted child; it should also have been every abortion a wanted abortion, but the two sides of the phony debate were never to meet. any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer. in 1997, cardinal winning [leader of scotland's 750,000 catholics] took the first step in the direction of providing a genuine alternative to abortion by offering support in the form of an unspecified lump sum of money to women who would otherwise have an abortion because they could not afford to have a baby.
the outcry was immediate; the money was called a bribe that would lure women away from what was best for them—i.e., childlessness. nevertheless, donations poured into cardinal winning's fund until, at the time of writing, £180,000 had been donated, half of which had been paid out. two hundred women had applied for assistance, 50 of whom had borne children, with 50 more on the way. cardinal winning no doubt hopes that government will take over his responsibility and offer support to every child conceived. feminists should share his hope, but the media has locked feminists into a position which they define as pro-abortion. feminism is pro-woman rather than pro-abortion; we have always argued for freedom of reproductive choice. but a choice is only possible if there are genuine alternatives. in britain, the anti-abortion lobby in the house of commons brings private members' bills year after year, apparently unaware that the medical establishment has no intention of allowing any curb on its right to dispose of blastocysts, fetuses and embryos as, when and how it sees fit. feminists react to each successive attack on the availability of abortion with grave concern, fighting a battle on behalf of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world. the pharmaceutical multi-nationals will not allow any wholesale revision of abortion rights, in case the mode of operation of their so-called contraceptives should be called in question.
in the british elections of 1997, the pro-life alliance hoped to field 50 candidates, thus qualifying for a party political broadcast in which to alert the unconscious public to the horrors of pregnancy termination—but they were fighting a rearguard action. a poll conducted by a sunday newspaper found that, even after a series of pregnancy-related scandals, 81 percent of people still thought that a woman had the right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy. another poll, carried out by mori, showed that abortion was no longer a minority issue; 45 percent of the sample knew close friends or members of the family who had had abortions, compared with 27 percent in 1980. the people polled were asked if they thought that abortion should be available for all who wanted it and 64 percent answered in the affirmative; of the 11 percent of the people polled who were catholics, half agreed with what 30 years ago would have been considered an extreme position. people also showed the beginnings of a retreat from the notion of eugenic abortion in cases where mental or physical handicap was suspected, which was supported by 84 percent of people in 1980 and by only 66 percent in 1997. in the contest between the doctor's right to choose versus the woman's right to choose whether to deliver a handicapped baby, the woman appears to be gaining ground.
there can be no gainsaying that women cannot manage their own lives if access to abortion is to be denied, but the need for abortion is itself the consequence of oppression. if we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. a woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. the man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. if the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. the crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. she is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. she will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. if she undergoes the tests, say for down's syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. and she will probably be talked into the termination.
her agony of mind is increased by the regular publication of results of research to establish whether and when human fetuses become aware, feel pain, can learn. in march 1998, we learned that fetuses are alert and can learn at 20 weeks gestation, before the formation of a cerebral cortex. the evidence was unconvincing, in that reaction was being construed as consciousness, but it had the desired effect—which was to worry women. feminists have argued that delaying abortion is immoral, but all measures to put in place speedy and non-traumatic abortion procedures, which would be embryologically identical with what passes for contraception, have been blocked by the same authorities who regularly produce evidence about the developing sensibilities of the fetus. a woman who is granted an abortion does not get to choose between abortions: abortion is presented to her as a single entity, when there is a bewildering array of options. non-surgical, do-it-yourself abortion has been possible for 20 years or more, but the health establishment rations and controls access to it. in the united states, the so-called morning-after pill is unavailable. in britain, it is not usually made available until the client has endured a sermon on reliable contraception. (one of the best-kept secrets in gynecology is the use of methotrexate and other cytotoxics for non-surgical abortion.)
in the united states, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. at the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with planned parenthood are using the method—and only in the united states. to be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. to become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. if she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate.
though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. these days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. iuds are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. the outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. you must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt. fake contraceptive technology manipulates women in ways that we are coming to condemn when they are practised on members of other species. what women don't know does hurt them.
if we ask ourselves whether we would have any hope of imposing upon men the duty to protect women's fertility and their health, and avoid the abortions that occur in their uncounted millions every day, we will see in a blinding light how unfree women are. women, from the youngest to the oldest, are aware that to impose conditions on intimacy would be to be accorded even less of it than they get already. the women who refuses to enter the gynecological abattoir, which extends into every bathroom in the country, must be prepared to do without male approval and attention.
the conclusion of the regular season is more signpost than finish line. before the season, allen sills, the nfl's chief medical officer, compared finishing training camp with a small number of cases to scoring a touchdown on the first drive. the league is now entering the fourth quarter with a tenuous lead, momentum tipping toward its opponent.
nfl teams have been inseparable from their communities. as coronavirus cases cases exploded across the country, they increased within the league. this weekend, more than 10 starters missed games after testing positive, with many more out because of close-contact risk. the new orleans saints played without all of the running backs on their active roster. cbs's tony romo, a grinning, football-savant face of the league, missed sunday's arizona cardinals-los angeles rams broadcast because of coronavirus protocols.
there was no guarantee the nfl would make it through unscathed after it resolved to play a season — owners motivated by the massive television revenue at stake, players unwilling to surrender a year of careers that run short. when 32 teams convened at august training camps, questions mounted about playing football in a pandemic. would the virus be spread in huddles? passed across the line of scrimmage?
this was a novel emerging virus, and we were tasked with figuring out a way to play a contact sport while a contact virus is out there, said nfl players association president jc tretter, an offensive lineman for the cleveland browns. and that is something that was difficult to wrestle with, difficult to figure out the best way to handle it.
the nfl and the nflpa had to set guidelines that affected every facet of the league. they established testing regulations, stipulations for behavior inside and outside team facilities, new roster rules and myriad other protocols that evolved during the season. it required uncommon trust between usually fractious parties.
the fact that we worked together in a way we haven't in the 11 years since i've had this job, that'll be the thing that sticks out to me, said george atallah, the nflpa's assistant executive director. … the flip side is how incredibly frustrating it is that we had to have a global pandemic to make the nfl and nfl owners realize that they need us to do this.
the nfl learned quickly that football itself did not spread the coronavirus. but the act of gathering at team facilities and in locker rooms could lead to infections, and the season did not pass without health costs. according to the nfl's most recent data, 222 players and 396 other personnel tested positive between aug. 1 and dec. 26. most of those players recovered and returned to play, seemingly without long-term ramifications. but not all.
ryquell armstead, a 24-year-old jacksonville jaguars running back, contracted the coronavirus in late summer. he had not recovered by late september and missed the entire season. the extent of his recovery is unclear, and his agent, ed wasielewski, said last week in an email that armstead's condition is not something that we would want to discuss at this time.
tommy sweeney, a 25-year-old buffalo bills tight end, developed myocarditis, inflammation of the heart that studies have tied to covid-19, in november and missed the rest of the season. denver broncos defensive coordinator ed donatell, 63, missed six games and spent five days in the hospital after contracting the virus.
i think everybody should be nervous, donatell told reporters upon his return. i wouldn't be telling the truth if i didn't think so.
the toll of playing football during a pandemic cannot be measured in positive cases alone. for months, the league and players lived in what atallah called the 24-hour stress cycle. testing results rolled into the league daily, creating constant worry.
people use 'day-to-day' as a cliche, atallah said. i don't think people realize how literal it was to be 'day-to-day.'
either to protect their families from the virus or to prevent themselves from catching it from a relative, many players lived apart from family. last monday night, after he played poorly in a dismal loss, new england patriots quarterback cam newton expressed frustration about sacrifices going unrewarded. newton reminded reporters they were talking to a person who ain't seen his kids in three months.
i'll always remember the time i had to spend away from my family, baltimore ravens defensive end derek wolfe said. those moments in my daughter's life that i'll never get back, that i never got to see.
without sacrifice and discipline, the season could not have survived. the times when staffers broke protocols demonstrated the season's fragility and created logistical nightmares. the nfl prioritized medical considerations and playing games on time over competitive fairness, which led to some bizarre moments.
the most existential threat to the season's viability came in week 4. the tennessee titans experienced an outbreak that ended with 24 players and staffers testing positive. the nfl postponed their game and rescheduled it for another week, rearranging a host of other games. the league eventually fined the titans $350,000 for lack of compliance, including lax mask-wearing.
the ravens were scheduled to play the pittsburgh steelers on thanksgiving night, a marquee rivalry and pivotal division showdown expected to be a ratings bonanza. but one week before the scheduled meeting, strength and conditioning coach steve saunders tested positive. it would later be revealed that saunders had come to work without reporting symptoms, failed to wear a mask at times and didn't always wear a tracking device. the ravens suspended him for a month.
the nfl postponed the game that wednesday, pushing it back to sunday. on thanksgiving day, quarterback lamar jackson, the reigning mvp, tested positive. the cases continued to mount until at least a dozen ravens tested positive and 20 players ended up on the covid-19 reserve list.
the nfl postponed the game again, to tuesday. ravens players pressured the league into delaying the game once more, to wednesday. another delay would have encroached on the next week's schedule and forced the creation of a week 18.
i can't tell you how close — you'd have to ask the commissioner how close we came to making the change, steelers owner art rooney ii said. but it was under consideration, i know that. … that's probably as close as we've come so far to having to open up that 18th week.
the result still stood as a bizarre symbol of a twisted season. the steelers and ravens played at pittsburgh's heinz field at 3:40 p.m. on a wednesday, in dying light in an empty cavern, competing for ratings in a time slot normally reserved for tv judges and paternity tests.
other absurdities mounted. on nov. 28, the saturday before they played the new orleans saints, the broncos learned their quarterbacks had violated protocols by gathering in a meeting room unmasked. after one of them tested positive, the broncos were forced to play without any quarterbacks. kendall hinton, a rookie wide receiver on the team's practice squad who started his career at wake forest as a quarterback, completed one pass and threw two interceptions in a 31-3 loss.
the constant roster juggling and schedule adjustments because of positive cases, along with the persistent empty seats, made normalcy impossible. the season still provided thrills for an audience stuck indoors and whose nfl obsession did not abate — 71 of the 100 highest-rated shows in 2020 were nfl games.
in defense of their super bowl title, the kansas city chiefs went 14-2. chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes will win his second mvp award by age 25 unless it goes to the green bay packers' aaron rodgers, who at 37 produced perhaps the best season of his incandescent career. the patriots' reign collapsed in their first year post-tom brady, while brady made the tampa bay buccaneers look like a team capable of becoming the first to play a super bowl in its home stadium.
the nfl still has to make it there. with cases across the country and within the league rising, the nfl will attempt to conduct the playoffs and hold the super bowl, the highest-stakes games on and off the field. it will be a massive test for the league to pull it off.
the short answer is: better likelihood of success with a smaller margin of error, atallah said.
there will be 14 playoff teams to start, dropping weekly to eight, four and then two. having fewer players, coaches and staffers means a lower probability of infections. but an outbreak would have a greater chance of jeopardizing the enterprise. playoff games cannot be rescheduled easily, if at all; tv networks will not allow a conference championship game to be played at 3:40 p.m. on a wednesday.
we said from the beginning, it wasn't about getting started, tretter said. … it was about staying started and continuing the season and finishing at the super bowl. and we are closing in on that goal. it's going to need everybody to continue to comply with protocols and do the right thing.
even if the nfl makes it through the playoffs, it still has to reshape its future. the league lost revenue without a full complement of fans in the stands. a television negotiation is underway. how to divvy revenue will have to be determined.
the nfl made it this far. its reward, fitting for these unrelenting times, is another challenge.
travelers easily could adapt in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, when the illness was mostly contained to a province in china. then cases started turning up — and spreading — in other countries.
concerns about widespread illness in such places as italy have brought anxieties closer to american travelers. late friday, the u.s. state department raised its advisory level to warn americans to reconsider travel to all of italy because of sustained community spread of the virus and warned against traveling in the lombardy and veneto regions. more than 1,600 people have tested positive there. the centers for disease control and prevention also elevated its language about the country, issuing a warning to avoid all nonessential travel.
i wouldn't have predicted a week ago that northern italy would be a place you wouldn't want to travel to right now, robert quigley, regional medical director for travel risk mitigation company international sos, said thursday before the advisories were raised. you can't predict where there's going to be the next hit.
late last week, authorities confirmed cases in the united states with no known origin, marking a new chapter for the spread in the country.
as each day brings news of more cases, what is a potential traveler to do? is it time to cancel a trip? should people move forward with their already-scheduled vacations? and for those still set on traveling, what's the best way to plan?
staying put is not an uncommon practice of late. major corporations called off large gatherings, and hotel chains reported rising cancellations. some travel agents report that clients are canceling cruise plans abroad and changing to u.s.-based sailings or all-inclusive resorts. airlines including american, jetblue and alaska waived change and cancellation fees for new bookings in case customers get nervous about traveling.
experts say there are resources potential travelers should consider when deciding whether to call off a trip, including advice and situation reports from the world health organization, advisories from the state department — which often contain detailed information about specific regions within a country — and notices from the cdc. as of monday, the health agency warned americans to avoid nonessential travel to china, iran, south korea and italy and to enhance precautions in japan because of the coronavirus.

i think right now what we're seeing is there is more transmission in certain parts of the world, and so it's important to keep an eye on where the transmission is being reported, said crystal watson, an assistant professor at the johns hopkins center for health security. right now those places might not be the best places to go if you can avoid traveling there. but i think soon we're going to see a lot more transmission around the world.
[these airlines are offering flexible travel options to adapt to the spread of coronavirus]
those deciding what to do, watson said, should consider whether they are at a higher risk for severe illness if they are infected. that includes people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions.
isaac bogoch, an infectious diseases physician and scientist based at the university of toronto, said that although patterns so far show most people infected with the coronavirus will have mild symptoms, there are still many questions.
i think we still have to remain humble that we don't have the answers yet, he said. because of that and because we don't have a vaccine and because we don't know a lot about this virus, people may have some fear wherever there are unknowns.
squaremouth, the travel insurance comparison website, noted a very large spike in calls from customers last week after the virus spread to italy. according to a survey the company provides after people buy insurance, 27 percent said they made the purchase because of the coronavirus.
right now we are primarily hearing from customers who want to cancel their trip because they are worried about how the virus is going to spread, just general feelings of fear and uncertainty, said squaremouth spokeswoman kasara barto. or they are still planning on traveling, but they want to be able to purchase a policy that lets them cancel in case the outbreak spreads.
[companies are canceling u.s. domestic travel over coronavirus fears]
most who have booked and want to cancel because they're scared to travel — or because their original reason for traveling might no longer be valid — are out of luck, unless they bought a comprehensive policy that allows them to call off their trip for any reason.
barto recommends calling hotels, airlines and cruise lines to find out if they can waive rebooking fees, change trip dates or otherwise offer flexibility. those who booked a trip with a travel agent should ask whether that person — who may have ongoing relationships with travel companies — can help make changes without a penalty, becky powell, president of protravel international, said in an email.
laurel brunvoll, owner of unforgettable trips travel agency, recommends taking a wait-and-see approach to cancellation to watch how the situation plays out.
for areas with a heightened risk, it may all depend upon when someone is planning to travel there, she said in an email.
if you go ahead with a trip
maybe it would be too costly to cancel. maybe travelers just don't want to reschedule, they're not in a high-risk group and the destination isn't under an advisory. whatever the reason, the trip is still on the table.
experts say the key before heading out is preparing in case the situation changes.
i think if you're going to travel — and i'm not saying that's a bad idea, i would really like to take a vacation myself — i think people should be aware that there's a possibility you could get stuck somewhere for an extended period of time, watson said.

she said during a trip, travelers should watch for news of changes and adjust their behavior accordingly if the disease is circulating in a community by staying away from public places, anyone who appears sick and large gatherings of people.
some countries are restricting where people can go or whether anyone is allowed to enter from affected areas, which could interfere with travel plans. popular attractions might not be open; the louvre closed sunday, and disney's theme parks in shanghai, hong kong and tokyo all closed temporarily.

tony roccaforte, senior security adviser at risk management company worldaware, said in an email that travelers should build redundancy into their plans, adding time for delays and preparing to improvise if conditions change.
have backups for your backups for everything from your communications devices, batteries, food/water, medication/eyeglasses, financial tools, transportation, lodging, airfare, etc., he said.
before leaving, he said, vacationers should get all their ducks in a row back home: update their will and powers of attorney, confirm life insurance and health insurance coverage and update their international immunization record. travelers should create a detailed itinerary of where they'll be and when and give it to a colleague or someone they trust at home.
[how likely are you to actually get sick from being on a plane?]
erika richter, spokeswoman for the american society of travel advisors, said in an email that travelers might consider bringing work materials with them in case they end up marooned and that they should bring extra copies of their passport, itinerary and proof of health insurance.
watson said the recommendation is for people to have 30 days of prescription medications with them, and they also should bring their original prescription in case they need more on the road.
anyone who is sick should not travel — not just to keep from spreading illness but also to avoid getting pulled out of lines and potentially quarantined, said quigley, of international sos.
he said thoroughly wiping down surfaces while traveling is always in order, because many viruses and bacteria can survive on objects. the cdc said it may be possible for someone to get the coronavirus by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but it's still not known how long the virus can survive on surfaces.
the basics are key to preventing infection, courtney kansler, senior health intelligence analyst at worldaware, said in an email.
this includes frequent hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable, she said. use social distancing and avoid obviously sick people. transit quickly through airports or similarly crowded transportation hubs.
travelers who didn't buy travel insurance when they booked a trip should consider adding a medical policy before heading out, squaremouth's barto said — though coverage is limited. she said last week that about a third of providers on the site are offering coverage that would include the virus.
i'm sincerely concerned about coronavirus, but i'm also worried about the insane amount of money my mom and i won't get back if travel is completely shut down in the next month 😰 — jacqueline buringa (@jackieburinga) february 28, 2020
for some travelers, no spreading virus will be enough to stifle wanderlust, especially with spring break and summer vacation season approaching. so how to proceed?
there are official travel advisories and warnings on where not to go. and there are maps showing where the virus has spread. but experts caution against merely picking a spot that has not yet seen a confirmed case.
every day we see more and more countries reporting their first case of this virus, and in addition to that, we see countries known to have this virus reporting an increase, said bogoch, the infectious diseases specialist, who has co-written research on the spread of the virus. if we're not calling this a pandemic, we're at least sitting at the precipice of a pandemic.
quigley said it's important for travelers to look constantly at the regulations and rules being enforced wherever they're going — and to realize everything could change if and when the world health organization declares a pandemic.
the responses will all be different, but clearly there will be a significant impact on travel both domestic and across borders, he said.
travelers considering where to go need to factor potential consequences of the virus' spread into their decision-making, said roccaforte, of worldaware. he said that includes the possibility of quarantines, travel restrictions, public transportation bans, food and water rationing, civil unrest and strained health-care systems.
[sign up for our coronavirus newsletter to stay updated on the outbreak]
anyone traveling should think about how they would find medical care if they got sick or hurt.
this is more important for people who have underlying health conditions, and it becomes even more important if there is an infectious disease outbreak, said watson, of the johns hopkins center for health security.
those making plans now still can buy insurance if they decide later to cancel because of coronavirus fears — though the policy won't be cheap.
right now, the only and best option we are recommending for people is a 'cancel for any reason' policy, barto said. that's only available within the first 10 to 21 days of booking a trip, she said, and it costs about 40 percent more than a standard cancellation policy. it reimburses 75 percent of the cost of the trip.
richter, the spokeswoman for the american society of travel advisors, suggests using a professional to help make plans for the spring or summer.
a travel adviser can help talk you through your list of options and pricing — they can help you come up with a plan a, b and c and having those back-up options on hand might put your mind at ease, she said in an email. in times like these, you need a travel advocate.

i think it's time to stop the tweeting about department of justice criminal cases, barr said in an interview with abc news, adding that such statements about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity.
people close to barr said that in recent months he has become increasingly frustrated with trump's tweets about the justice department. the president, they said, seemed not only to be undercutting his own political momentum but also to be fostering doubts about the department's independence. trump's tweet complaining that he believed his friend was being treated unfairly proved something of a last straw, they said, because it was so damaging to morale at the department.
barr was comfortable not being universally loved by career employees, but he felt the tweet tuesday raised a bigger problem, giving people reason to wonder whether the department had been corrupted by political influence and decided he could no longer remain silent about the president's public denunciations, these people said.
like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private discussions within the administration.
behind that public fight, according to people familiar with the discussions, is a deeper tension between trump and barr's justice department over the lack of criminal charges against former fbi director james b. comey and those close to him.
attorney general william p. barr pushed back against president trump's recent attacks on the justice department during a feb. 13 interview with abc news. (the washington post)
the tension has worsened in the past month, these people said, and came to a head monday when prosecutors on the stone case filed a recommendation to the court that stone receive a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for his conviction on charges of obstruction of congress and witness tampering.
on tuesday, after trump denounced the move, the justice department filed a softer sentencing recommendation, and the four prosecutors who signed the initial court filing quit the stone case. one left the government entirely.
barr insisted thursday that he had planned to modify the sentencing recommendation before trump issued his tweet but that the president's comments made the department look bad.
since becoming attorney general last year, barr has enthusiastically defended the president, much to the frustration of congressional democrats and some current and former justice department officials upset over what they consider an erosion of the agency's independence. thursday's interview marked a stunning break from that practice.
the attorney general said he was prepared to accept the consequences of his comments.
i cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me, he said. he also noted that when he became attorney general, he pledged to resist improper influence from any quarter, whether congress, the white house or elsewhere.
the president has harshly criticized multiple current and former justice department officials — and a federal judge — over prosecutions and investigations involving trump's former associates and alleged leaking by government officials. but barr insisted thursday that trump has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case. trump, he said, never talked with him about the stone sentencing recommendation, and he had not discussed the roger stone case at the white house.
white house press secretary stephanie grisham said in a statement late thursday that the president had not lost confidence in the attorney general.
the president wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any american citizen, to publicly offer his opinions, grisham said. president trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the american people against injustices in our country, including the fake news. the president has full faith and confidence in attorney general barr to do his job and uphold the law.
the flare-up over the stone case comes against a backdrop of growing behind-the-scenes anger from the president toward the justice department — more about whom the department has not charged with crimes than about whom it has charged, according to people familiar with the discussions.
trump has repeatedly complained about fbi director christopher a. wray in recent months, saying that wray has not done enough to change the fbi's culture, purge the bureau of people who are disloyal to him or change policies after violations of the foreign intelligence surveillance act.
he has also tweeted many times that he thinks comey should be charged with crimes, and he was particularly upset that no charges were filed over the former fbi director's handling of memos about his interactions with trump. an inspector general report faulted the former director for keeping some of those memos at his home and for arranging for the contents of one of the memos to be shared with a reporter after comey was fired in 2017.
justice department inspector general michael horowitz referred comey's handling of the memos to prosecutors for possible criminal prosecution, but lawyers quickly determined it was not a close call and did not seek to build a case.
that sent trump into a rage, according to people briefed on his comments. he complained so loudly and swore so frequently in the oval office that some of his aides discussed it for days, these people said. trump repeatedly said that comey deserved to be charged, according to their account.
can you [expletive] believe they didn't charge him? trump said on the night of the decision, these people said. trump has also wanted charges filed against comey's former deputy, andrew mccabe. a separate inspector general investigation concluded that mccabe lied to investigators about his role in authorizing disclosures for a wall street journal story in october 2016 about internal fbi tensions over an investigation of the clinton foundation. a grand jury in washington seemed poised to make a decision on the case last year before fizzling into inaction.
trump's anger over the lack of charges against fbi personnel flared again in january, prompted by two unrelated developments, according to people familiar with the matter.
first, prosecutors updated their position in the case of former national security adviser michael flynn, saying a sentence of some prison time would be appropriate. around the same time, the washington post reported that u.s. attorney john huber in utah — tapped years earlier to reinvestigate several issues related to vague allegations of corruption against hillary clinton — had quietly wound down his work after finding nothing of consequence.
those two developments further enraged the president, according to people familiar with the discussions. these people said that while the public debate in recent days has focused on leniency for stone, the president is more upset that the justice department has not been tougher on his perceived enemies.
in the president's mind, it is unacceptable that people such as comey and mccabe have not been charged, particularly if people such as stone and flynn are going to be treated harshly, these people said.
in recent weeks, these people said, the president's anger has focused increasingly on jessie liu, the former u.s. attorney for the district of columbia, whose office has been handling many of the cases related to comey and other former fbi officials.
that office has recently conducted interviews in a leak inquiry, eyeing senior fbi officials over news stories in 2017 that discussed a top-secret russian intelligence document that influenced comey's decision-making in 2016. many of investigators' questions have seemed focused on the former fbi director.
separately, barr tapped u.s. attorney john durham in connecticut to investigate whether any crimes were committed by fbi and cia officials in the pursuit of allegations in 2016 that russia interfered in the election to benefit trump's campaign.
after learning that the huber investigation is not likely to produce charges, trump has become more insistent that durham finish his work soon, according to people familiar with the discussions. trump, these people said, wants to be able to use whatever durham finds as a cudgel in his reelection campaign.
all of that frustration has fed into the public fight over the stone case.
in thursday's abc news interview, barr said that he was surprised by prosecutors' first filing in the stone case and that the president's tweet had nothing to do with his decision to soften the stone sentencing recommendation less than 24 hours after it was filed.
the attorney general said that tim shea, liu's successor as u.s. attorney for the district, had spoken with him briefly monday, before the stone filing, and told him the prosecutors very much wanted to recommend the seven to nine years to the judge. but barr claimed that shea told him he thought that there was a way of satisfying everybody and providing more flexibility.
i was under the impression that what was going to happen was very much as i had suggested, which is deferring to the judge, and then pointing out various factors and circumstances, barr said.
barr said when he saw news reports monday night of the recommendation that was filed, he thought, gee, the news is spinning this; this is not what we were going to do.
i was very surprised, barr said. and once i confirmed that that's actually what we filed, i said that night, to my staff, that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to amend that and clarify what our position was.
next came the president's tweet complaining that stone was being treated unfairly, which barr said put him in an untenable position.
once the tweet occurred, the question is, 'well, now what do i do?'  barr said. and do you go forward with what you think is the right decision, or do you pull back because of the tweet? and that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be.
barr said trump would be within his rights to ask for an investigation in an area that didn't affect his personal interests — such as in a terrorism case, or fraud by a bank. but he said an attorney general would not listen to an order to investigate a political opponent.
if he were to say go investigate somebody, and you sense it's because they're a political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out, barr said.
on wednesday, trump praised the department's change of course and singled out barr specifically.
congratulations to attorney general bill barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought, trump wrote on twitter. evidence now clearly shows that the mueller scam was improperly brought & tainted.
people close to barr said that the tweet of praise frustrated the attorney general because it further cemented the public notion that the attorney general was doing trump's bidding on the stone case.
democrats called this week for the justice department inspector general to investigate the dispute surrounding stone's sentence recommendation.
stone was convicted by a jury in november. the charges against him were the last filed by former special counsel robert s. mueller iii as part of his investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
the new sentencing recommendation — signed by shea and a different career prosecutor — said the previous guidance could be considered excessive and unwarranted under the circumstances. shea, a former close adviser to barr at justice department headquarters, was installed at the u.s. attorney's office in the district last month.
prosecutors and defense lawyers can only make recommendations about prison sentences. stone's sentencing is scheduled for feb. 20 before u.s. district judge amy berman jackson, whom trump also targeted this week in tweets complaining about her treatment of paul manafort, his former campaign chairman, and suggesting jackson had, in another case, gone too easy on his democratic rival in 2016, hillary clinton.
separately on thursday, chief u.s. district judge beryl a. howell of washington also issued a rare statement responding to president trump's attacks on jackson.
the judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors; the submissions of the parties, the probation office and victims; and their own judgment and experience, howell said. public criticism or pressure is not a factor.
what millennial voters care about in 2020
eugene scott describes the impact young voters may have on the presidential election. drew harwell on the psychological toll of web-connected cameras. and dan keating explains whether stop-and-frisk actually lowered the crime rate in new york city.
under the concept of disparate impact, actions can amount to discrimination if they have an uneven effect even if that was not the intent, and rolling back this approach has been a longtime goal of conservative legal thinkers. past republican administrations have done little to erode the concept's application, partly out of concerns that the supreme court might disagree, or that such changes would be unpopular and viewed as racist.
civil rights advocates said diminishing this tool could have sweeping consequences.
disparate impact is a bedrock principle, said kristen clarke, president and executive director of the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law. through the courts, we've been able to marshal data and use the disparate-impact doctrine as a robust tool for ferreting out discrimination.
in new york, a lawsuit alleges that a large apartment complex in queens will not rent to anyone with a criminal record, and that this has the effect of discriminating against african american and latino renters. the suit is pending, relying on disparate impact to make the case.
in maryland, civil rights groups complained to the federal government after the state shifted transportation money from a light-rail project that would have helped mostly african american residents of baltimore. the money instead went to bridge and road projects that served mostly white residents elsewhere in the state. a transportation department investigation into the matter was closed this summer.
in education, the obama administration reached settlements with school systems such as the one in lodi, calif., where an investigation found widespread disparities in student discipline. african american students, for instance, were five times as likely as white peers to receive out-of-school suspensions for willful defiance or disruption.
in 2014, the obama administration formally advised school systems they may be guilty of racial discrimination if students of color are punished at higher rates.
when investigators and courts incorporate disparate impact in a review, they are looking at more than the intent of laws or practices. they are also evaluating whether a policy's impact varies based on race, ethnicity or other factors. regulations across the government implementing the 1964 civil rights act and its amendments define discrimination as including this unintentional form of bias.
the trump administration signaled its hostility to this approach in a report issued last month by the federal commission on school safety, which recommended rescinding the school discipline guidance. in a sharply worded and controversial chapter, the report said the validity of disparate impact analysis cannot be squared with the supreme court's holdings. the administration revoked the guidance a few days later.
disparate impact was written into the original regulations that implemented title vi of the 1964 civil rights act, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin by entities, including schools, that receive federal funding. the school safety report argued that earlier administrations had adopted the concept without regard for what the underlying statute said. it said that interpretation was of questionable validity and dubious, at best.
one person familiar with the administration's planning said the strong language in the school safety panel's report really signals the direction that the administration is going in. to that end, the education department is considering replacing the original title vi regulation, this person said. he and others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe internal discussions.
one option under consideration includes clarifying the title vi regulation to make its use consistent with the trump administration's legal views. another option would replace the regulation with a new one, which would require a formal and lengthy process of public notice and comment.
those options are separate from the justice department memo, which was described by a person familiar with the document as a starting point for moving toward removing disparate-impact-based regulations across the federal government.
in june, the department of housing and urban development published a notice announcing that it plans to consider revising its 2013 regulation on disparate-impact claims in the fair housing act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion and other factors in sale, rental or financing of housing. the agency signaled that it was reconsidering how the regulations affect the insurance industry, which has challenged them in court.
data showing that a policy resulted in uneven consequences is not sufficient to prove a discrimination claim. a school or other institution accused of discrimination under the concept of disparate impact can defend itself by showing the policy is justified and that no other method exists to accomplish a goal.
the supreme court has recognized disparate-impact claims, but in a 2015 housing case, its use was upheld by a narrow 5-to-4 vote, in an opinion written by justice anthony m. kennedy, now retired. some conservatives have speculated that the new court, with justice brett m. kavanaugh in kennedy's place, might decide the same matter differently.
much — but not all — of the disparate-impact law could be changed by the administration because the concept was incorporated through regulations, which administrations are free to change by following a formal process. a broad-based rewrite of regulations could affect areas such as transportation and environmental law, as well as education and housing. but it would be harder to make changes to voting and employment law, experts say, because the concept of disparate impact is overtly written into the underlying statute, not just the regulations.
supporters of disparate-impact analysis say it is a critical tool because finding smoking gun evidence to prove someone intended to discriminate is difficult. and even if the intention wasn't to discriminate, advocates say institutions should be held accountable for discriminatory effects.
most people don't have access to what's going on in somebody's mind. even if a decision was intentionally discriminatory, it's going to be very difficult to prove, said ajmel quereshi, senior counsel with the naacp legal defense fund.
but conservatives have long argued that proving discrimination should require proof that someone intended to treat people differently. and they say that if people are being judged by numbers, they may feel pressure to make decisions based on racial quotas.
the disparate-impact approach requires decision-makers to make decisions with an eye on race. that is exactly what the civil rights laws are supposed to prohibit, said roger clegg, president of the center for equal opportunity, a conservative think tank focused on race and ethnicity. he said he has lobbied trump administration officials to write the idea out of federal regulations.
disparate-impact analysis, he argued, is not necessary to combat true discrimination. he said he also tried to persuade officials in the george w. bush administration to do the same, without results. the bushes were very skittish on civil rights issues, he said.
dunn, a dynamic attacker who won the 2015 league mvp trophy, was free to pursue other opportunities after the expiration of her contract with the u.s. soccer federation, which underwrites the nwsl and allocates national team members to the 10 teams. krieger and dunn were the spirit's only u.s. team representatives.
they were among a group of players who had grown disenchanted with the spirit organization, several sources said. dunn played down her issues with the spirit, saying in a phone interview from europe: my decision is based on trying a new environment. i absolutely loved the spirit. it was a hard decision, but it's the right time for me.
dunn, 24, is the second prominent national team figure to move overseas this winter: forward alex morgan signed a six-month pact with french club olympique lyonnais, the reigning european champion.
while morgan plans to report back to orlando this summer, dunn has no such arrangement, even though the english season ends in may, the second month on the nwsl calendar. her contract does include options to leave if things don't work out, but she said, i will not be in the nwsl in 2017.
dunn was in london about a month ago, touring chelsea's facilities and meeting club officials.
i felt at home, she said. after the visit, we had some conversations. what's it going to take? they knew i was interested, so it was only a matter of dotting some i's and crossing some t's.
contract terms were not disclosed. she is the first high-profile american to sign a major deal with a team in the english league, which is a step below the nwsl but, with increased backing from traditional clubs such as chelsea, is beginning to grow.
dunn's departure is a setback for both the spirit and nwsl, which is seeking to gain a lasting foothold after the failure of two previous women's pro soccer ventures (wusa and wps).
of course it hurts to lose such a talented player, spirit coach jim gabarra said, but this is professional sports, and every time there's a roster spot open, it creates opportunities for others.
after a u.s. camp in the los angeles area this month, dunn will join chelsea full time in late january. she'll return home regularly for national team events.
before signing with chelsea, she consulted with u.s. coach jill ellis.
i told her i want to do it but also am very committed to the national team, said dunn, a winger whose 14 u.s. goals in 2016 were third on the squad behind morgan and world cup hero carli lloyd. jill told me, if i was going to do it any year, it's this year. it was a good feeling having her support. that was something very important to me, being able to feel as though i am part of the national team and not feel as though i am missing out on opportunities.
it's a great deal, being able to do the national team and also have the experience of playing overseas.
chelsea is a founding member of the 19-team fa women's super league, which features two divisions and promotion-relegation. home matches are played at a 3,000-seat suburban stadium. the blues won the top-flight title in 2015 and qualified for the uefa women's champions league the past two years.
dunn is not the only american eyeing england: multiple sources said heather o'reilly, who retired from the national team last fall, has spoken with london-based arsenal. the winger, 32, played the past two seasons in kansas city after two in boston.
every member of the 2015 u.s. world cup squad and 2016 olympic team was domestically based. and over the years, the few aligned with european clubs, such as krieger (germany) and lindsey horan (france), have moved to the nwsl. however, with big european clubs beginning to invest more heavily in women's soccer, u.s. players have greater club options abroad today.
meanwhile, the national team players have been locked in a long-running labor dispute with the ussf. the collective bargaining agreement expired dec. 31, and, while negotiations continue, the previous terms have carried over.
the ussf compensates about two-dozen elite players for service with both an nwsl squad and the national team. because dunn will collect a salary from chelsea, she'll accept a prorated deal for national team activity.
by joining the english team, she leaves what sources say was a toxic atmosphere in washington last season.
krieger, a northern virginia native who joined the team for the inaugural 2013 season, was unhappy with gabarra's playing style and player management. she differed with owner bill lynch, a local software executive, on how he ran the team. those sources, ranging from players to people familiar with the team, also cited communication issues between gabarra and the players.
one source, who requested anonymity in fear of retaliation, said the players went to the championship, and yet were so unhappy.
krieger did not respond to interview requests. a day after she was traded, the defender, 32, told her half-million instagram followers that the deal was a surprise but i do think change can be a good thing. she learned of the trade from orlando officials, not washington's.
despite the successful season, several others are gone or possibly on the way out.
shortly after the season ended, argentine forward estefania banini, washington's leading scorer and a free agent, signed with spanish club valencia.
annapolis native christine nairn, a starting midfielder coming off a quality season, was traded this past fall to her previous team, the seattle reign, for a player and three draft picks. defender megan oyster (15 starts) was dealt to boston for two players. the latter deal also yielded the no. 1 position in the nwsl's distribution ranking order, the mechanism for placing unaffiliated u.s. and canadian national team players.
the status of midfielder diana matheson and goalkeeper stephanie labbe, olympic bronze medalists with canada last summer, is unclear. matheson, 32, has been with the team since 2013. labbe lost the starting job the second half of the season.
dunn said, i would be lying if kriegs leaving and christine nairn leaving isn't something i thought about, but my decision to leave was far beyond the different changes happening with the spirit.
addressing fans angered by the trades, gabarra said: there are numerous factors and decisions to be made, often based on dozens of moving parts involving multiple points of interest. in most every case, the public will never see or know all of the reasons.
gabarra, who is also the general manager, was in his first year with the spirit after coaching washington teams in previous women's pro leagues.
reaching the nwsl championship match in houston was great, he said. however, it's still my job to look forward and continue to put things in place that give the club the best chance to keep reaching for our goals. as is the case with every team in pro sports, changes must be made because no matter how successful a season, things can always be better.
lynch made headlines late in the season when he broke league protocol and ordered the star-spangled banner played while washington and seattle players were in the locker room, preventing reign star megan rapinoe from kneeling during the anthem.
in subsequent days, the players expressed disappointment by posting a statement on the team's website. lynch made an emotional, in-person apology to the group for overshadowing the game, a victory that clinched home-field advantage in the playoffs.
the offseason upheaval comes in the wake of the best season in the team's short history: washington (12-5-3) was second in the regular season behind the portland thorns and defeated the chicago red stars in the semifinals for its first playoff victory.
the team thrived despite dunn's lower production. after posting a league-leading 15 goals in 2015, the long island native split time between club and country this past year and did not score for the spirit until late in the campaign. she shined in the final against the western new york flash, scoring twice, including a go-ahead strike in extra time, but the spirit conceded a late equalizer and ultimately lost in a penalty-kick tiebreaker.
in sydney, temperatures hit 117 degrees fahrenheit on sunday, the hottest it has been since 1939. that oppressive heat, a side effect of climate change, has made life hard for the country's humans and infrastructure. heat waves result in 10 percent more calls for ambulances and 10 percent more deaths, local experts said. police in victoria, on australia's southeastern coast, warned drivers last week that a six-mile stretch of a freeway in the central part of the state had melted. a spokeswoman for vicroads, which manages victoria's road systems, told the australian broadcasting corp. that hot weather caused the asphalt to become soft and sticky and the road surface to bleed.
it has also been nearly unbearable for some animals. anytime we have any type of heat event, we know we're going to have a lot of animals in need, animal specialist kristie harris told the bbc. it was so hot that possums burned their paws on roofs and roads. birds needed to be specially rehydrated. koalas around the region were being sprayed down to keep them cool.
and hundreds of flying fox bats died because they didn't have enough cover to protect themselves from the heat. animal rescuers in sydney described heartbreaking scenes of dozens of dead baby bats piled on the ground. as the adult bats sought shade near a creek, babies were left dangling from trees with no means to survive the heat, according to a charity organization in the sydney suburb of campbelltown, home to colonies of flying foxes. many were found scattered on the ground. others died before they made it down.
it was unbelievable. i saw a lot of dead bats on the ground and others were close to the ground and dying, volunteer cate ryan told the guardian. i have never seen anything like it before.
flying foxes have adapted to australia's warm climate, but these fruit-eating bats are unable to regulate their body temperature when the outside temperature rises above 104 degrees fahrenheit. the young ones are especially vulnerable, ryan told the camden-narellan advertiser.
they have less heat tolerance, she said. their brain just fries and they become incoherent. often, she said, they will simply get too hot and fall to the ground while the adults seek out precious shade.
wildlife volunteers and rescuers spent sunday picking up bodies of about 200 flying foxes, most of which were babies, according to the charity help save the wildlife and bushlands in campbelltown. the death toll was expected to rise to the thousands, as many were still dangling from trees and were unreachable to volunteers.
many pups were on their last breaths before getting much needed help . . . there were tears shed and hearts sunken, the charity said sunday in a lengthy facebook post. it's devastating when a colony like our local one goes down like this due to heat, this colony needs more canopy cover and shaded areas to help with our ever rising hot summers because this episode will surely not be the last.
australia considers the gray-headed flying fox, one of four types, a vulnerable species — with about 400,000 left, down from more than 560,000 in 1989. the bats live in woods and swamps along australia's east coast and play an important role in pollination and seed transportation.
experts link the plight of flying foxes to the globe's steadily rising temperature. more than 30,000 flying foxes died across australia during heat waves between 1994 and 2008, bat ecologist micaela jemison wrote in 2014.
last year, more than 2,000 flying foxes were found dead in the richmond valley region of northern new south wales on australia's east coast, the australian broadcasting corp. reported. temperatures topped 113 degrees fahrenheit. about 100,000 bats across the state of queensland died during a heat wave in 2014.
this is of great concern to scientists not only due to the increased risk of these 'die off' events, but also for the long term impact it will have on the recovery of several of these already threatened species, jemison wrote.
australia's heat wave — and the united states's bomb cyclone — come on the heels of the second-warmest global year on record since the 1800s.
a new report, pointing to signs of climate change such as the thawing of arctic ice and intensifying wildfires, says the global average surface air temperature in 2017 exceeded 14.7 degrees celsius (58.46 fahrenheit), making last year a bit cooler than 2016, the warmest on record. but 2016 included the tail end of a strong el niño in the tropical pacific, and that bumped up temperatures that year, as well as in 2015, according to the report by the copernicus climate change service, a european agency.
these findings are echoed in australia's bureau of meteorology's climate report for 2017, the country's third-warmest year on record.
as washington rallied for a 114-110 new year's eve win over the chicago bulls, the team connected on 16 three-pointers. it was the third time in five games in which the wizards had made at least 16 and the second straight game they tied an franchise mark with 36 attempts from beyond the arc.
team basketball. just moving the ball. guys making extra passes is all it is, john wall said. we got guys who can make some tough ones, but when you're moving the ball and just trusting the offense anything can happen.
before the recent uptick, washington had ranked in the lower third of the nba in three-point attempts per game. however, if the fluctuating lineups at the end of 2017 serve as an indication of a new emphasis on long-distance shooting, then the wizards will look more like the team that has averaged 32.0 threes over the past three games.
on sunday, reserve forward mike scott returned to rhythm after missing one game because of the birth of his daughter and scored 17 points with a trio of threes while playing crucial minutes in the team's small lineup. scott, a 6-foot-9 forward, even logged some time at center in the fourth quarter and took some lumps against bulls 7-footer robin lopez.
he's like 7-5. he's doing hook shots for them, scott said. i can't block that [stuff].
even so, scott created offensive mismatches, and while forming an athletic front line with otto porter jr. he helped open the floor for beal to make three game-changing triples in the quarter.
obviously, when you have a smaller lineup, you have the ability to have more three-point shooters on the floor, coach scott brooks said. a lot of teams are going small, and we're one of them also. it's nothing against our bigs, but we just have to keep adjusting. it could be game-to-game. i thought ian [mahinmi] was our main guy to give houston trouble scoring last game and i thought our small ball gave them trouble scoring, especially in that fourth quarter. mike can battle their bigger players. i know [robin] lopez had a couple of post-ups down low, but that's not how they want to play. nobody wants to play that way. that's a low-percentage shot throughout the league.
beal made 7 of 13 attempts from beyond the arc overall and scored a game-high 39 points. for a man who doesn't make resolutions, beal's plans for 2018 will look much like last year: keep shooting.
like i always told you guys from the get-go, i might have games where i don't might make any, and games where i make seven, and games where i make two, beal said. that doesn't change my confidence. i continue to shoot the same way, with the same mechanics and the same mentality. i believe that every shot is going to go in. i was happy and fortunate that they were falling [sunday].
scott brooks thinks this wizards season would make for a thrilling six flags ride
buttigieg proved to be a powerhouse of the middle lane with a goldilocks hold on being seen as about right between more liberal and conservative wings of the party.
preliminary exit poll results show sanders dominated among voters in his core groups of very liberal, less wealthy and very young voters, but faded at the other end of the spectrum. similarly, klobuchar was strong with older and more religious voters and more moderate and conservative voters, but dropped off outside those groups.
by contrast, buttigieg ran a steady line, never too popular, never far behind. voters were asked whether four major candidates' positions on the issues were too liberal, not liberal enough or about right. about 7 in 10 voters called buttigieg about right, more than 20 percentage points higher in that middle ground than anyone else. about half of voters called sanders too liberal, and roughly 4 in 10 said warren was too liberal. four in 10 said biden was not liberal enough. the exit poll did not ask this question about klobuchar, who finished stronger than in final pre-primary polls.
buttigieg showed the same steady pattern with voters who were more religious or less religious. klobuchar narrowly won voters who attend worship services at least occasionally, and sanders won those who never attend services. but buttigieg got about 2 in 10 of those who do attend services and those who don't.
while sanders was much more popular among men than women and klobuchar was considerably stronger among women than men, buttigieg was about the same with both men and women.
buttigieg got 2 in 10 of voters 45 and older as well as among voters younger than that. sanders won 4 in 10 of the younger but 1 in 6 of the older, and klobuchar reversed that with 3 in 10 of the older voters but 1 in 10 of the younger. buttigieg was about equally popular among voters with or without college degrees, while sanders and klobuchar once again swung up and down, with sanders taking voters without college degrees and klobuchar leading narrowly among college graduates.
sanders clobbered klobuchar and other candidates among very liberal voters, getting nearly twice as many as her, while klobuchar got almost twice as many moderate or conservative voters as sanders. buttigieg sat right in the middle, getting over 2 in 10 of both groups.
for one thing, aside from the #dts (drain the swamp) hashtag, he doesn't actually disagree with republicans on the substance of the move — the office is unfair, he writes. it's just the timing he seems to take issue with.
and some house republicans say they just weren't prepared for the media storm that hit them when news of the rules change broke.
i don't think that a lot of people believed that the press would be as bad as it was, rep. mike simpson (r-idaho) told reporters.
congressional experts say trump's tweet undeniably had some effect on republicans' decision to suddenly drop the ethics changes. draining an independent ethics office of power is not on-brand with trump's drain the swamp message, a populist platform that proved terribly efficient at vaulting him and republicans into power in 2017.
in that sense, trump's words matter. ryan credited trump with helping republicans sweep wisconsin at the federal level in november, and he and other republican leaders know all too well how quickly trump can turn on them.
to that point, rep. charlie dent (r-pa.), a recent chairman of the ethics committee embroiled in all this, told reporters that house gop leadership said trump's opposition should be a consideration in whether to pull the rule. in a closed-door meeting tuesday morning, republicans nearly unanimously decided to pull it.
but republicans also have a reputation to uphold beyond the one with their president. in a few weeks, they'll have nearly all the keys to washington — congress, the white house, the power to put a conservative on the supreme court — and no one else to blame but themselves for anything that goes wrong.
republicans have unified control of washington for the first time since 2006, and they have an ambitious agenda that they want to start working on right away, said molly reynolds, a congressional analyst with the brookings institution. it's not in their interest to have things in the news that distract from that.
some members of congress do have serious issues with the office of congressional ethics, issues they say the media failed to grasp when reporting the changes to the office, said joe kasper, chief of staff to rep. duncan d. hunter (r-calif.).
hunter didn't write the rule change, but he supported it after spending much of this past year under investigation by the office for campaign expenditures for transport for a family pet rabbit, money he said was an oversight and that he quickly repaid but felt the office unfairly pursued.
still, no one's going to cry for a member of congress who feels he or she has been unfairly investigated by an ethics committee. and as the public pressure piled on from all sides, and calls poured into capitol hill, more and more republicans started to realize that, even before trump tweeted his thoughts, the gop should table the changes (at least for now.)
it's a hard issue for a lot of members to deal with, kasper said. and it's an issue that most members want to avoid.
republican leaders were already squeamish about the change before the media or trump knew what was happening. gop staffers told reporters that when republicans were discussing it monday night, house speaker paul d. ryan (wis.) and house majority leader kevin mccarthy (calif.) didn't like the political optics of it. (ryan ended up sending out a statement tuesday saying he supported the rules change, just a few minutes after trump criticized it.)
trump's tweet may have actually offered republicans an alternative path to the same destination: just wait for the controversy to blow over. congressional ethics expert norman ornstein, a vocal opponent of the ethics changes, summarized trump's tweets like this: in effect what he's saying is, 'hey, don't kill it in broad daylight at noon in times square; wait a few months and drag it behind a back alley and nobody will see.'
in the end, ornstein says the republican flip-flop on the ethics change was probably the result of a perfect storm of pressure: trump's tweets; the sensitivity around their first and potentially narrative-setting day in power; and a stronger-than-expected backlash in the media and from constituents, whose calls flooded capitol hill tuesday.
not a matter of debate: the fact that this was just a dumb political play for republicans to pursue on their first day in office.
the enforced inactivity could rattle supply chains for products that are sold in u.s. stores and around the world. some of apple's chinese suppliers, for example, now are scheduled to remain closed until feb. 10, chief executive tim cook told investors tuesday, adding that executives are working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss.
most analysts remain upbeat, but the economic consequences of the fast-moving virus could snowball if the problem isn't soon contained, some executives said. china is the world's second-largest economy and home to factories that produce machinery, computers, furniture and chemicals for customers on every continent. in one sign of mounting worry, a growing number of major airlines have halted or reduced flights to and from china.
the health crisis comes just two weeks after the signing of a u.s.-china trade deal eased the uncertainty that had shrouded chinese export factories for nearly two years. across the globe, health officials, corporate executives and central bankers on wednesday struggled to determine the bottom-line impact of the outbreak.
the situation is really in its early stages. it's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be, federal reserve board chair jerome h. powell told reporters. i'm not going to speculate about it at this point. we are very carefully monitoring the situation.
financial markets in the united states and europe, however, shrugged off virus fears. the dow jones industrial average ended the day relatively flat, closing at 28,734, up just 11 points or 0.04 percent. chinese markets are closed for the holiday.
but in the absence of concrete information from china, many investors appeared to be gambling that the outbreak would prove no more damaging than earlier scares, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) episode of 2003.
we simply don't know how far, or fast, the novel coronavirus outbreak will ultimately spread, john higgins, chief markets economist for capital economics in london, wrote in a research note. so for the time being, we are assuming that the response … will follow the same pattern observed during and after previous epidemics — that the initial panic will be unwound after a few weeks or months.
china's economy has roughly quadrupled since 2003, measured in yuan, and now accounts for close to one-third of annual global growth, according to the international monetary fund. beijing's debt also has swelled, perhaps limiting the government's ability to spend its way out of any downturn as it did after sars. and the global economy is less robust than it was during the earlier epidemic.
it's hard to see what the generator of a significant rebound would be, said one executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with chinese officials.
the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in china already has surpassed the 2003 sars count. with chinese officials anticipating thousands more patients in the coming days, businesses are confronting difficult decisions.
starbucks temporarily closed more than half of its stores — or more than 2,000 locations — in china, its largest market outside the united states. google said it closed its five offices in mainland china, hong kong and self-governing taiwan.
the airline industry has been a particular focus. white house officials have been meeting with airline executives about the virus, according to one person briefed on the talks. the white house has told airline executives that it is considering suspending all flights between the united states and china.
on wednesday, american airlines and british airways reduced direct flights to and from the country, joining a growing cluster of international carriers suspending service. lufthansa canceled all flights to and from china until feb. 9, though the german airline said it would continue service to hong kong.
american, delta air lines and united airlines extended their change-fee waivers through the end of february.
passenger air traffic was about 35 percent lower at the sars outbreak's worst point for airlines in the asia-pacific region, according to the international air transport association. and for 2003 as a whole, the association estimated that sars cost those carriers 8 percent of their revenue, or roughly $6 billion at the time.
chinese sales account for about 10 percent of the global revenue of starbucks. chief executive kevin johnson said he had planned to raise the company's financial forecast for the year on tuesday but decided not to because of the virus. company shares fell more than 2 percent.
we're now managing a very dynamic situation in china. … we realize this is a temporary issue we've got to deal with, johnson told cnbc.
mcdonald's, kfc and apple have also announced closures, which will probably dent their financial results. walt disney said it would temporarily close its disneyland and disneytown parks in shanghai. ikea said it would close nearly half of its 30 chinese locations.
smaller manufacturers that lack multinationals' global support staffs are scrambling to assess the threat to their operations. they are freaking out, said dan harris, a seattle-based attorney whose clients operate in china. it's extremely difficult to plan because nobody knows what's going to happen.
finding alternatives to chinese suppliers cannot be done quickly or easily, as companies that tried to escape president trump's tariffs learned. other countries such as vietnam, thailand or malaysia lack china's mix of qualified suppliers, trained workers and modern logistics.
if this virus is not contained within the next few weeks, some companies are going to die because of this, harris said.
trump's tariffs prompted many companies to begin looking for replacement suppliers, according to jake parker, senior vice president of the u.s.-china business council. coupled with the continuing tariff uncertainty, the virus has triggered an increased sensitivity to the risk exposure of the chinese market, he added.
some industries could be especially hard-hit. china accounts for about 80 percent of raw pharmaceutical ingredients sold to manufacturers, according to specialists. drug manufacturers and the food and drug administration have yet to report any shortages, but the potential for such issues exists if the crisis persists.
``the coronavirus is a warning shot across the bow that we have to rethink and diversify the sourcing of the core raw materials, chemical intermediates and active ingredients for our generic drugs, said rosemary gibson, author of china rx and a senior adviser at the hastings center, a nonprofit bioethics research institute.
switching to an alternative supplier in india would not solve the problem because indian drugmakers depend on china for their raw ingredients.
most factories and businesses in china are closed as the nation celebrates the new year. for now, the most visible disruption has been to consumer-oriented industries such as travel.
this year, about 3.1 million cars and trucks are expected to come off the assembly lines in hubei province and nearby shanghai, said carla bailo, president of the center for automotive research. those vehicles account for about 12 percent of china's output. but if manufacturers in hubei and shanghai — honda, toyota, renault-nissan-mitsubishi and volkswagen among them — delayed operations for a five-day workweek, that could result in 150,000 lost units, bailo said.
the frigid spell was particularly noteworthy for occurring when the planet is steadily warming because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. climate warming from the increase in these heat-trapping gases does not eliminate cold waves, but it tends to weaken them.
an international group of scientists has concluded the recent piercing chill was 15 times less likely than it would've been 100 years ago, when temperatures in such cold waves averaged about 4 degrees lower.
the cold was highly unusual in the current climate, wrote the scientists who analyzed the temperatures.
temperatures were close to 25 degrees colder than normal in a zone that included minneapolis, detroit, buffalo and boston over the period from dec. 26 to jan. 7. boston's high temperature did not escape the teens for seven days, tying its longest streak in recorded history.
given how much the climate has warmed, the scientists called the recent cold exceptional. yet, as frigid as it was, the scientists found that there were many similar or colder two-week periods in that region in earlier periods. they made clear that, on balance, cold outbreaks like these are getting less frequent due to global warming, but cold waves still occur somewhere in north america almost every winter.
their finding that the intensity of arctic cold is easing in a warming world is supported by many other studies. for example, jonathan martin, a meteorology researcher at the university of wisconsin, has documented considerable shrinkage of the pool of frigid air surrounding the arctic in recent decades.
the scientists involved in the analysis rejected the hypothesis that climate change is making these cold extremes more likely by warming the arctic more than the mid-latitudes and altering the atmosphere's circulation.
we do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. in fact, they said, less arctic air is coming south than it used to.
the rapid-turnaround analysis was published as part of the world weather attribution project, in which — in a matter of days — scientists assess whether a recent weather event was made more or less likely by climate change. the project is a partnership of climate central, a nonprofit science communication organization in princeton, n.j., and several international research institutions.
even as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times.
daniel swain, a researcher at ucla, published a study late in 2017 that showed a warm-west, cold-east weather pattern over the united states has become more frequent in recent decades. a subsequent study linked the prevalence of this pattern to arctic sea-ice loss driven by climate change.
generally, a growing body of literature has suggested that as the earth warms and arctic ice melts, the jet stream may slow down and become more erratic, which could lead to pockets of extreme winter conditions, even as most places thaw.
michael mann, a climate scientist at pennsylvania state university, described the recent winter weirdness as in no way evidence against climate change. in fact, he wrote, it is an example of precisely the sort of extreme weather we expect because of climate change.

it seems like the cold just keeps going and gets even colder. alas, there is real change on the horizon. keep that in mind, especially over the next 24 hours or so, while we're still dealing with some of the most punishing winter weather we see around here of late. tomorrow's still cold, but more typical stuff. then we really start to notice a difference.
get our daily forecasts on your amazon alexa device. click here to find out how.
today (saturday): it's yet another about as cold as it gets around here kind of day. it is also the last of the worst of this stretch. winds stay up, and temperatures struggle. we'll be playing with wind chills near and a little below zero for much of the day. it is at least very sunny! that doesn't help temperatures much, as they reach the upper teens to near 20. winds are out of the northwest about 10 to 20 mph, with gusts near or past 30 mph. dulles stands a chance of breaking its record low maximum for the day of 20. confidence: medium-high
tonight: skies remain clear, and winds finally die off. this is a recipe for reaching for the very coldest of depths. the one question mark might be the fact that cold air is beginning to move away aloft, which may limit lows. even so, near zero to 10 should do it most spots. there is a better chance someone gets below zero as well, especially in valleys with snow cover. confidence: medium-high

tomorrow (sunday): the weather conveyor belt has slowed down a bit, so now it seems as though sunday should also want to be mainly sunny. high pressure begins to float to our east late in the day, so it could be that we see increased clouds as that happens. given the very cold start, and limited return flow of warmer air, temperatures are still quite cold, mainly in the mid-20s to near 30 for highs. much less wind, though. almost light! confidence: medium-high
tomorrow night: at this point, the coldest air is strongly in retreat, but everything is still a block of ice, so it won't matter a ton. upper teens to mid-20s might feel like spring to some. clouds increase into morning. confidence: medium
there's a slight chance of some showers as soon as sunrise monday. if that's the case, we could have some iciness to contend with. for that matter, i'd watch this one until it's clear it's not an issue. the ground is so solid and everything will still be cold, so any precipitation that falls might have a chance to cause issues. mid-30s to about 40 should do it. some showers could last into the night, with lows settling to the low and mid-30s. confidence: medium
we're in between waves on tuesday, and also getting more legitimately into milder air. highs head for 50 under partial sunshine. that's almost shorts weather these days! confidence: medium

i never said we're doing it that quickly, but we're decimating isis, trump told reporters sunday morning as he headed for camp david. with that being said, we're pulling out of syria. but … we won't be finally pulled out until isis is gone.
that's a big but. it's also at odds with trump's initial announcement that the u.s. would depart within 30 days and that the islamic state has been defeated, not decimated.
meanwhile, visiting jerusalem to reassure israeli leaders on sunday, white house national security adviser john bolton acknowledged that pockets of the islamic state remain undefeated and argued that a quick pullout could endanger u.s. forces. he pledged that the kurds in syria would be protected and added that the defense of israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured.
the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement, bolton said during a news conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu.
national security advisor john bolton said on jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that turkey will not target kurdish forces. (reuters)
-- two fresh data points from sunday show that the islamic state, while in retreat, has not been vanquished.
1. a missile attack by the islamic state wounded two british soldiers and killed at least one kurdish fighter they were with in eastern syria, per the ap. it's the first known casualty by coalition forces since trump announced the pullout.
2. kurdish forces in syria said sunday that they had captured two american citizens hiding out in the country's final islamic state stronghold, per louisa loveluck and erin cunningham. in a statement, the syrian democratic forces, or sdf, identified the detainees as warren christopher clark, 34, and zaid abed al-hamid, 35. … in a sign of how far some of the group's members had traveled as their battlefields shrank, the sdf said sunday that clark and hamid had been captured hundreds of miles from mosul, in the hajin area of eastern syria. … clark was a texas resident and worked as a substitute teacher in the houston area before traveling to saudi arabia and turkey to teach english … he reportedly converted to islam in 2004 and later became radicalized online.
-- moreover, the u.s.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of trump's announcement. between december 16 and december 29, us-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting isis in syria, cnn reports. the strikes were carried out against isis fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities … prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in syria as fighting around the isis-held town of hajin ramped up.
-- among the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of syrian kurdish fighters that u.s. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the islamic state, karen deyoung and karoun demirjian report. while trump has expressed confidence that turkey, which controls its own syrian force opposed to both the kurds and to president bashar al-assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the islamic state, pentagon and state department officials question turkish priorities and capabilities. … bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving iran from syria was also an objective for both the united states and israel. but trump appeared to indicate sunday that both iran and russia, whose forces in syria back assad, were potential u.s. allies against the islamic state.
during a jan. 2 cabinet meeting, president trump said his decision to pull the united states out of the iran nuclear deal had significantly weakened iran. (the washington post)
-- these are the kinds of significant questions that would typically be hashed out during an interagency process before a public announcement. a review of the timeline illustrates how erratic the trump administration's rhetoric has been:
dec. 14: what triggered all this was a phone call from turkish president recep tayyip erdogan. trump was briefed before to warn the turkish leader not to invade syria, as he had been threatening to do, per david ignatius. but trump instead told erdogan: 'you know what? it's yours. i'm leaving.'
dec. 19: trump announces the withdrawal. our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back, and they're coming back now, he said in a video posted to twitter. we won.
we have defeated isis in syria, trump added, my only reason for being there during the trump presidency.
dec. 20: jim mattis resigned as defense secretary during what one senior administration official described that day as a disagreement in the oval office, in which mattis sought to persuade the president to stand down on the syria withdrawal but was rejected.
getting out of syria was no surprise, trump tweeted. i've been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when i very publicly wanted to do it, i agreed to stay longer. … time to come home.
indeed, trump had declared extemporaneously in march during a speech in ohio: we'll be coming out of syria, like, very soon. let the other people take care of it now! then he backed off in the face of resistance from aides and the brass — just like he might be doing again.
dec. 24: trump declared that saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria, instead of the united states. the saudis responded that they had not made any financial pledges since august, when the state department announced that riyadh had committed $100 million to a stabilization fund.
dec. 26: trump told reporters on air force one during his flight to iraq that he would reject any request from generals to again extend his deadline for pulling out. they said again, recently, 'can we have more time?' trump said of u.s. generals. i said: 'nope! you can't have any more time! you've had enough time!' we've knocked them out.
speaking to the troops, trump criticized their commanders for failing to meet the previous deadlines he set. we're no longer the suckers, folks, the president said.
dec. 30: sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) told reporters after eating lunch with trump at the white house that the president reassured him the syria decision was more of a pause situation than a withdrawal.
dec. 31: isis is mostly gone, trump tweeted. we're slowly sending our troops back home.
jan. 3: trump said during a cabinet meeting that iran's leadership can do what they want in syria.
jan. 4: in response to reports that trump extended his deadline for pulling out from 30 days to four months, one of four senior administration officials speaking to reporters during a background briefing said, we have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from syria.
president trump defended his decision to withdraw u.s. troops from syria during an unannounced visit to iraq on dec. 26. (the washington post)
-- all these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. trump's words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. president barack obama also learned this the hard way when he said assad using chemical weapons would be a red line and then didn't forcefully respond when he did.
-- cleanup on aisle nine: senior administration officials are fanning out across the middle east this week on a handholding mission to reassure anxious allies. bolton will visit turkey on tuesday. pompeo has stops scheduled in eight countries: saudi arabia, kuwait, the united arab emirates, qatar, bahrain, oman, egypt and jordan.
-- for his part, trump continues to insist on unflinching loyalty. the chief of staff at the pentagon has been forced out of his post because of white house concerns about his close ties to mattis, the wall street journal's gordon lubold reports: the pentagon announced that kevin sweeney, a retired navy rear admiral who had worked closely with mr. mattis, had stepped down. … mr. sweeney had worked alongside mr. mattis at several points during his career, including when mr. mattis was still in uniform … the bond was a source of concern to the white house, the u.s. officials said, adding the appointment of pat shanahan as acting secretary by [trump] last month was seen as an opportunity to remove mr. sweeney. …
mr. sweeney had expressed a desire to stay on at the pentagon as recently as last week, per the journal. some officials believed he would provide continuity during the transition from mr. mattis to mr. shanahan. but, under pressure from the white house, mr. shanahan informed mr. sweeney on friday that he was removing him as chief of staff friday.

lawmakers from both parties discussed on jan. 6 how a deal could be reached to end the government shutdown. (luis velarde/the washington post)
-- the trump administration and democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall — signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. robert costa, juliet eilperin, damian paletta and nick miroff report: as agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting white house budget director russell t. vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. it demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. the administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an obama-era program that allowed children in guatemala, honduras and el salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the united states ...
but a border wall is 'central to any strategy,' vought wrote, and democrats — who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government — remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. a democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the white house hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.
-- trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. robert costa, felicia sonmez and nick miroff report: trump also said sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. 'i can relate, and i'm sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,' trump said. he claimed that 'many of those people agree with what i'm doing': refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. and he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say 'steel barrier.'
-- white house officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to bloomberg news's justin sink and jennifer jacobs. some advisers close to trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. … but trump's consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the white house see the gambit as the president's lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with democrats fall flat.
-- trump's press secretary left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency in a fox news interview. from politico's victoria guida: [sarah] sanders said trump 'is prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country.' 'we're looking at exploring every option available that the president has,' she said. 'whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful.' she also argued that the president isn't 'holding anybody hostage' by not signing legislation that would fund government agencies other than the department of homeland security. 'he knows it's better if they can focus on getting all these packages done at once,' sanders said.
-- republican sen. susan collins (maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the house. from the hill's brett samuels: collins said on nbc's 'meet the press' that she understands [mitch mcconnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the democratic-held house, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like agriculture, interior, transportation and housing and urban development. 'i'm frustrated in the situation that we've gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,' collins said. 'it is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. i think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.'
people are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked. volunteers are stepping in to stop conditions from deteriorating. (luis velarde, juca favela/the washington post)
-- meanwhile, the effects of the shutdown are mounting. from costa, eilperin, paletta and miroff: the department of housing and urban development sent letters to 1,500 landlords friday as part of a last-minute effort to prevent the eviction of thousands of tenants. a lot of those tenants live in units covered by a hud program that many agency officials didn't realize had expired on jan. 1 and that they are now unable to renew. … treasury department and internal revenue service officials are trying to determine whether they will be able to pay tax refunds next month, despite the fact that they said last year they would be prohibited from doing so in the event of a government shutdown.
-- the national park service has decided to use entrance fees to pay for expanded operations at popular sites, an unprecedented step that some call illegal. juliet eilperin reports: under a memorandum signed saturday by the interior department's acting secretary, david bernhardt ... park managers will be permitted to bring on additional staff to clean restrooms, haul trash, patrol the parks and open areas that have been shut during the more-than-two-week budget impasse. in a statement sunday, national park service deputy director p. daniel smith acknowledged that the administration's practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. … congressional democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the federal lands recreation enhancement act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.
-- small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. heather may, annie gowen and joel achenbach report: many of the affected federal workers — including 10,000 people in utah, 6,200 in west virginia and 5,500 in alabama — have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. but those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them — eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores — creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.
-- millions of food-stamp recipients could have their benefits disrupted if the shutdown drags past january. cbs news's grace segers reports: the u.s. department of agriculture, which oversees snap at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. although snap is automatically renewed, it has not been allocated funding from congress beyond january. congress has appropriated $3 billion in emergency funds for snap distribution, but that would not cover all of february's obligations.
-- some federal prison employees expressed frustration about serving meals of steak and cornish hen to inmates as they work without pay. cleve r. wootson jr. reports: for inmates at [florida's coleman federal correctional complex], new year's day lunch was grilled steak, steamed rice with gravy, black-eyed peas, green beans, macaroni and cheese, a choice of garlic biscuits or whole wheat bread and an assortment of holiday pies. the feast was served by not-particularly-festive prison guards and workers who have no idea when they will receive their next paycheck — but who have to come to work anyway because they work in crucial public safety jobs.
sen. elizabeth warren campaigned in northwest iowa as part of her inaugural appearances in the first presidential caucus state. (alice li/the washington post)
-- joe biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. the new york times's jonathan martin and alexander burns report: [biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other democrats eyeing the white house can defeat [trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. … yet mr. biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and african-americans are expected to run. … more broadly, debate around mr. biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. … but mr. biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.
-- sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using trump's name. annie linskey and chelsea janes report: she aimed directly at voters tempted by [trump's] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of trump himself almost entirely. … for warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. that was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.
-- trump has become the silence between the notes of warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy, david weigel writes. when warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the 'million dollars a day' that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former wells fargo chief executive john stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. it's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.
-- in a blog warren wrote between 2005 and 2008, the then-harvard law professor criticized biden for a vote he cast in the senate. nbc news's jack bohrer reports: in march of 2006, warren wrote that biden's 2005 vote in favor of the bankruptcy bill that spurred her foray into blogging made him part of 'a bi-partisan coalition to prefer powerful corporation [sic] over hard-working families.' 'for years, senator joe biden vied with republican senators charles grassley and [orrin] hatch for head cheerleader for this bill,' warren wrote. 'even as he tried to position his national image as a strong supporter of women, senator biden was twisting arms to get the bankruptcy bill through congress.'
-- warren's senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her — or any of her prospective challengers. politico's burgess everett reports: even sen. ed markey isn't ready to endorse his fellow massachusetts democrat, at least not yet. 'when she is moving forward, we're going to be talking,' markey said as he prepared for warren's swearing in to another term in the senate. 'i've just got to get today done.' warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. with a wide open democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.
-- trump's campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. politico's alex isenstadt reports: the president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when never trump republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national tv audience. … for trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in charlotte would be endless. they could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. the campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it's building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. the initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.
the u.s. military said on jan. 6 it had killed yemeni militant jamal al-badawi, a suspected planner of the deadly bombing of a navy destroyer, the uss cole. (reuters)
-- trump tweeted that the al-qaeda operative accused of organizing the 2000 bombing on the uss cole, jamal al-badawi, was killed in a u.s. airstrike. felicia sonmez reports: u.s. central command, which oversees military operations in the middle east, confirmed badawi's death sunday afternoon. … seventeen american sailors were killed and more than 40 were injured in the oct. 12, 2000, attack, in which al-qaeda suicide bombers pulled up to the refueling destroyer in an explosives-laden boat and blasted a hole in its hull.
-- with trump seemingly offering to play the role of mediator, serbia and kosovo appear to inching closer to peace talks. anne gearan reports: kosovo president hashim thaci made a previously unreported diplomatic trip to berlin last month, where he met with u.s. ambassador richard grenell, a trump confidant. thaci pledged then that he would reverse course on punitive tariffs imposed on all serb goods. … serbia has never recognized kosovo's independence and has warned of an armed intervention over the latest disagreements. … trump sent personal letters to the leaders of both countries last month, urging them to return to peace talks and offering the possibility of a joint white house invitation.
-- trump's trade war is increasingly disrupting u.s. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. the new york times's peter s. goodman reports: in the united states, factories that buy steel and aluminum — now more expensive — are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of american tariffs. companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. … the tariffs have been sold to americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the united states, abandoning china, mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. but the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.
-- a south korean newspaper reported that trump and kim jong un may meet in hanoi for a second nuclear summit. from bloomberg news's jihye lee: u.s. officials have met their north korean counterparts in hanoi for discussions to adjust scheduling for the talks, [the south korean newspaper munhwa ilbo] said, citing high-level diplomatic sources in seoul and washington it did not identify. … vietnam is a long-standing ally of pyongyang that has good relations with washington. speculation about the country's prospects as a summit site grew following north korean foreign minister ri yong ho's visit there from nov. 29-dec. 2.
-- a top royal adviser saudi officials have named as a key suspect in the killing of post columnist jamal khashoggi has dropped out of sight. kareem fahim reports: so in the seven weeks since [saud al-qahtani] was placed under investigation, only rumors have filled the silence. he was spotted recently in the coastal city of jiddah, a resident said, and in the offices of the royal court here in the capital, according to a person who works with the government. other accounts put qahtani, once a top aide to crown prince mohammed bin salman, in a remote corner of the kingdom, laying low. the government's treatment of qahtani is being closely watched in washington and other foreign capitals as a test of whether saudi arabia is sincere about prosecuting everyone found to be involved in khashoggi's killing, including senior officials.
-- scientists say the high-pitched noise that diplomats in havana complained about before displaying mysterious neurological symptoms may have been caused by one of the region's insects. the guardian's ian sample reports: [a] fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the uk and the us now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as anurogryllus celerinictus. … the identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats' health problems.
-- british prime minister theresa may urged parliament members to back her brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. politico's laura kayali reports: she refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. … 'don't let the search for the perfect brexit be the enemy of the good,' may said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line brexiteers and eu supporters such as former european commissioner peter mandelson, who argue the deal undermines british sovereignty and should be rejected. … may slammed mps asking for a second referendum. 'it would divide our country and we wouldn't be able to organize a referendum before march 29 [when brexit will take effect],' she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the eu).
-- if britain leaves the european union without a deal, it could reverberate across other e.u. countries, including the netherlands. michael birnbaum reports: the netherlands — britain's main trading partner on mainland europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that britons will leave the e.u. on march 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. and britain's other trading partnerships in europe could be even worse off. … irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of brexit. france is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.
there's a bear in the woods:
-- democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's alabama senate race, which was inspired by russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. craig timberg, tony romm, aaron c. davis and elizabeth dwoskin report: recent revelations about project birmingham … have shocked democrats in alabama and washington. and news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … but all those who have acknowledged playing a role in project birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. project birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire reid hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of democratic causes after the 2016 election. while acknowledging his money ended up paying for project birmingham, hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the new york times and the post.
-- one facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported republican roy moore's candidacy. the new york times's scott shane and alan blinder report: the 'dry alabama' facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. along with a companion twitter feed, the facebook page appeared to be the work of baptist teetotalers who supported [moore]. 'pray for roy moore,' one tweet exhorted. in fact, the dry alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive democrats who were out to defeat mr. moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.
-- nancy pelosi downplayed the possibility that house democrats would attempt to impeach trump without bipartisan support to do so after hearing the findings from robert mueller's investigation. brian fung reports: democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without republican backing, pelosi hinted. that could hinge significantly on whether mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. 'if and when the time comes for impeachment,' she said, 'it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.' pelosi's remarks were echoed sunday by house majority leader steny h. hoyer (d-md.), who said calls for trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from democrats' 'substantive agenda.'
-- house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff (d-calif.) said he wants to share the panel's testimony transcripts with mueller to determine whether any witnesses have committed perjury. i don't want to go into enumerating particularly who i have concerns about, but i do have concerns about certainly multiple witnesses, schiff said on cnn. bob mueller, by virtue of the fact that he has been able to conduct this investigation using tools that we didn't have in our committee, meaning compulsion, is in a better position to determine, ok, who was telling the truth? who wasn't? and who can i make a case against in terms of perjury?

if one of your new year's resolutions is to spend less time sitting in or leading useless meetings, this book is for you. rogelberg, a researcher who studies teamwork and meetings at the university of north carolina at charlotte, offers evidence-based ideas for how long meetings should be (about 5 to 10 percent shorter in length than your initial estimate), how to make agendas more effective (move status updates to the end) and how to improve idea generation (consider a silent reading period for workers to consider a new proposal and then have a discussion rather than listen to a long presentation).
by cal newport, expected feb. 5
a follow-up to newport's first book (deep work) on the digital communication distractions people experience at work, digital minimalism looks at the tyranny of online social media, mobile phones and technological interruptions in our personal lives. newport, an associate professor of computer science at georgetown university who has written several books related to work, technology and study habits, suggests that people need to take more comprehensive steps than just, say, not keeping their phones by their beds at night. instead, they need a full-fledged philosophy of technological use, opting out of any optional online activities for 30 days and then slowly adding back the ones they need in a sustainable way.
by james o'toole, expected feb. 26
o'toole, an emeritus professor at the university of southern california's business school, shares the stories of more than two dozen business entrepreneurs — some famous, some little known — who tried to incorporate socially responsible business practices into how they ran their companies. yet the result is not a hagiography lauding the careers of these enlightened capitalists, which includes everyone from chocolate magnate milton hershey to cosmetics and skin care founder anita roddick, but a cautionary look at how so many of their sustainable practices were cut short by bankruptcies, acquisitions or unwilling successors — and what other executives can learn from them. at a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. it asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well.
by tomas chamorro-premuzic, expected march 12
a provocative title that began life as a harvard business review article — and has grown to become one of the publication's most-read stories online — this upcoming book looks at how to spot incompetent leaders and identify good ones, as well as why companies so often mix up the two. chamorro-premuzic, who is chief talent scientist at manpowergroup and teaches at university college london and columbia university, explores our inability to distinguish between confidence and competence, how narcissism affects the gender imbalance in leadership, the advantages he says women generally have with traits like emotional intelligence and how organizations can better evaluate potential and coach and develop leaders.

business leaders often turn to examples from history for inspiration — bullet points from business consultants can only take people so far. for those readers, this biography of former supreme court justice sandra day o'connor — the first woman on the highest court — by journalist evan thomas is unlikely to disappoint. before joining the court, o'connor became the first female majority leader of a state senate and then served time as a judge on the arizona state court of appeals. the book's synopsis suggests that it offers inspiration for women and men who want to be leaders and be first in their own lives — who want to learn when to walk away and when to stand their ground.

by marcus buckingham and ashley goodall, expected april 2
buckingham, the management guru whose books about finding your strengths at work have become best-sellers, and goodall, an executive at cisco, argue that several of the basic truths of the workplace today are not really true, but lies — or at least distorted conventions, wrong assumptions or under-analyzed habits. prompted by a harvard business review article that condemned the traditional performance review, their upcoming book busts open and calls out ingrained ideas such as people can reliably rate other people and people care which company they work for, making it a guide that could help you rethink your organization's thinking.
by melinda gates, expected april 23
part memoir, part call to action, part profile of women she's met through her work as co-chair of the gates foundation, gates' debut book is an inspirational look at the need to empower women to make change in the world. the book is organized by issue (family planning, education for girls, child marriage, women in the workplace), and gates weaves in personal stories of her own life and tales of women she's met along the way to describe why lifting up women is the key to lasting change. as she writes in her introduction: i quickly realized —because i was quickly told — that it wasn't enough to speak up for family planning, or even for each of the issues i've just named. i had to speak up for women. and i soon saw that if we are going to take our place as equals with men, it won't come from winning our rights one by one or step by step; we'll win our rights in waves as we become empowered.

in a world where expertise feels less and less valued, it may seem heretical to suggest that generalists can win out over specialists. but epstein, a propublica journalist and author of the sports gene, which examined the nature vs. nurture debate on athletic performance, writes that in most fields — especially complex and unpredictable ones — generalists are better positioned to excel. relying on scientific research, epstein examined successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists for this study of performance, a reminder that having many interests, starting late and quitting frequently can have value, too.
by ash carter, expected june 11
this year will be full of autobiographies or books about american ideals, many of them leadership-themed, by potential presidential aspirants. former starbucks ceo howard schultz has a book launching in february. sen. kamala d. harris has a title coming this month. we didn't consider any of those for the list, but former defense secretary ashton b. carter's memoir about his career and the leadership lessons from running the pentagon seems worth a look, especially following the sudden departure of jim mattis from president trump's cabinet. carter, who served more than 35 years in the department of defense, draws on his career to describe what it takes to be the chief executive officer of a department that employs millions of people and manages one of the most complex organizations on earth.
to recap, cousins played his fifth season in washington (and his second as the redskins' starting quarterback) under the nfl franchise tag in 2016, which guaranteed a $19.953 million annual salary. cousins started all 16 games for a second consecutive season and broke the redskins' single-season passing record of 4,166 yards, which he set the previous year, by throwing for 4,917. he finished with 25 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions while leading the redskins to their first back-to-back winning seasons in 20 years.
but unlike 2015, when cousins played his best down the stretch of the season (finishing with 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions), he played poorly in two late-season games, against carolina and the new york giants, that were crucial to the team's playoff hopes. largely as a result, the redskins missed the playoffs with an 8-7-1 record.
nonetheless, cousins is a good fit for the redskins' offense. he is sturdy, starting all 32 regular season games since being named the starter. though cousins will be 29 when the 2017 nfl season opens, coach jay gruden believes he is still improving. and the redskins have few appealing alternatives, with the 2017 draft class and free agent crop regarded as thin on quality quarterbacks.
here's a look at the various scenarios in play regarding cousins's future, followed by a comment on the probability of each:
scenario no. 1 — the redskins complete a long-term deal with cousins by march 1, the deadline for nfl teams to apply the franchise or transition tag.
probability: low. cousins has no incentive to get the process over quickly, before his agent has a chance to see the value of other quarterback contracts this offseason and before cousins has a chance to gauge with other nfl teams might have interest in him.
scenario no. 2 — the redskins allow cousins to become an unrestricted free agent and take their chances on re-signing him, bidding against other teams on the open market, if they decide they want him back in 2017.
probability: low. needlessly risky, when the redskins have other options for limiting cousins's movement while they work toward a long-term contract.
scenario no. 3 — if the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by feb. 15, the redskins prevent cousins from going elsewhere by using the nfl's exclusive franchise tag during the permissible window, feb. 15 through march 1. the exclusive franchise tag prevents cousins from negotiating with other teams while buying time for the redskins and cousins to reach a long-term deal by july 15.
probability: high to middle. the exclusive franchise tag gives the redskins the most control over the situation, while giving them roughly five months to keep working toward a long-term deal.
scenario 3b — the redskins and cousins reach a long-term deal by the july 15 deadline, which replaces the exclusive franchise tag the moment cousins signs it.
probability: middle. the redskins' top offer during the failed talks for a long-term deal in 2016 was $16 million annually, with $24 million guaranteed. cousins sought $20 million annually and $60 million guaranteed. neither side budged much, if at all. it's logical to assume that in 2017, cousins would seek a minimum annual salary of $24 million and a guarantee of $60 million or more in any long-term deal. both sides would have to 'give,' in all likelihood, in order to reach a long-term deal this offseason.
scenario 3c — if no long-term deal is reached by july 15, cousins must play for the redskins under the franchise tag for one more year, at a guaranteed salary that's estimated to be about $24 million.
probability: high to middle. a sound option that gives the redskins total control of cousins's next step.
scenario no. 4 — if the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by feb. 15, the redskins limit cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the nfl's non-exclusive franchise tag during the permissible window, feb. 15 to march 1. under the non-exclusive tag, which guarantees a salary that's slightly less than the exclusive tag, cousins can negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. but the redskins have the right to match that other team's offer.
probability: high to middle. also a sound option that buys time for the redskins, protects their investment in cousins and assures compensation (see below), if another team wants to pay above what the redskins are willing to match.
scenario 4b — if cousins signs an offer sheet with another team, the redskins match the offer to keep him in washington.
probability: high to middle, depending on the value of the offer.
scenario 4c — if cousins signs an offer sheet with another team that the redskins decline to match, the redskins are compensated with two first-round draft picks by the team that signs cousins.
probability: low. many are skeptical that an nfl team would give up two first-round picks for cousins, but all it takes is for one team to feel he's worth the price if they believe he's the best fit. redskins general manager scot mccloughan loves additional draft picks, and the redskins have multiple needs to address on their roster.
scenario 4d — if cousins signs an offer sheet with another team that the redskins decline to match, the redskins can agree to accept less than two first-round picks as compensation by working out a tag and trade deal — for example, accepting a first- and third-round pick or a second- and third-round pick in a trade for cousins.
probability: middle. the redskins would get something of value in exchange for cousins, but they would need to have a solid plan b in mind for their starting quarterback in 2017.
scenario no. 5 — if the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by feb. 15, the redskins limit cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the nfl's transition tag during the permissible window ( feb. 15 to march 1). the transition tag's salary guarantee is less than franchise tag (the nfl hasn't yet released the position-by-position tag values for 2017. in 2016, the transition tag value for quarterbacks was $17.696 million — or roughly $2.3 million less than the franchise tag.) under the franchise tag, cousins could negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. the redskins would have only the right of first refusal and would get no draft-pick compensation if they choose not to match the other team's offer.
probability: low. the savings of the transition tag isn't worth the risk of losing cousins without getting any compensation.
scenario no. 6 — if the redskins give up on negotiations toward a long-term deal after tagging cousins and, for any reason, change their mind about bringing him back (as the carolina panthers did in march/april 2016 after applying the non-exclusive tag to cornerback josh norman) — they rescind the tag, making cousins a free agent. if they rescind the tag, the redskins would get no compensation.
probability: low. it's all but impossible to imagine a change of heart that would involve the redskins letting cousins go without getting something in return.
scenario no. 7 — cousins signs the contract once he is franchised by the redskins, guaranteeing the one-year deal and effectively ending the need for further negotiations toward a long-term deal.
probability: low. it's in cousins's interest to wait until the last possible minute to sign any contract, so he can weigh the redskins' offer against other quarterbacks' 2017 deals.
the new york freshman floated the idea in a 60 minutes interview that aired sunday. she said those earning more than $10 million a year should face a top rate of 60 to 70 percent on that income to help pay for a green new deal that would eliminate fossil fuels in 12 years. she is seeking a seat on the house financial services committee, which oversees the banking and housing industry.
blowback from the right was fierce. house minority whip steve scalise (r-la.) misconstrued the proposal as a broad-based tax hike on all income:
as did anti-tax lobbyist grover norquist, likening it to slavery:
but left-leaning economists note the proposal is hardly radical, given rates that high — and higher — were on the books for for the top income bracket amid the prosperous middle decades of the last century. and some recent research (including from nobel-winning economist peter diamond) argues a top rate slightly north of 70 percent is optimal for the ultra-rich. (the idea also drew praise from at least one figure on the right, with ann coulter tweeting she agrees.) julián castro, the former obama administration housing chief moving toward a presidential bid, pointed to history in endorsing ocasio-cortez's idea during a sunday appearance on abc's this week.
as my colleague dave weigel noted, castro's breezy co-signing signals just how quickly the tax policy discussion within the party can leap to the left:
expect other democratic 2020 hopefuls to go there soon, too. sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), for example, has said she wants to roll back republican tax cuts passed in 2017. though she has eschewed naming a number she would favor for a top marginal rate, she has pointed out it was well above 50 percent in the post-world war ii era. and in her kickoff tour through iowa this weekend, she said washington needs to embrace big structural change to restore economic fairness.
the goal for aspiring democratic leaders won't simply be extracting a pound of flesh from point-one-percenters. ocasio-cortez invoked the idea as a revenue source for a moonshot proposal — and her party's presidential pool will shortly be teeming with others looking to for ways to pay for similarly ambitious projects. (one estimate puts a $2.8 trillion price tag on sen. kamala d. harris's proposal to offer tax credits or direct payments to lower and middle-income families.)
the washington post's jeff stein crunched the numbers with tax experts and found a new bracket for those earning more than $10 million a year would hit 16,000 households. roughly doubling the rate they pay on income over that threshold, as a 70 percent rate would, could generate $720 billion over a decade. that could pay for a number of liberal dream programs. from jeff: it could come close to funding the entirety of sanders's free college tuition plan ($800 billion), fund president barack obama's plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75 billion over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in america ($1.4 trillion), cover democratic leaders' plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding ($100 billion), or come close to funding a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.
the soak-the-rich idea's early traction points to party in which the center of gravity has already moved measurably to the left. barely two years ago, hillary clinton's platform called for imposing a surcharge on the incomes of those earning more than $5 million, effectively saddling them with a 44 percent top marginal rate. and four years before that, after winning a resounding reelection victory in part on a pledge to raise taxes on the rich, obama signed a package that raised the top rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent for couples earning more than $450,000 a year. obama negotiated that deal with a republican congress.
but the fact remains that the democrats' last two standard bearers proposed tax policy changes at the margins. the party's next one is likely to call for a much sharper departure.
— second thoughts on 2019 market forecasts. the wall street journal's michael wursthorn and akane otani: the market's roller-coaster ride has prompted some wall street analysts to cut their 2019 forecasts, the latest sign of unease as the stock bull market approaches its 10th year. major indexes rallied friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report boosted investors' confidence in the u.s. economy, and federal reserve chairman jerome powell suggested the central bank would be flexible with its policy plans.
still, a brutal december selloff and lingering worries about the health of the global economy have kept major indexes well below their records. investors' confidence also took a hit after apple inc. late wednesday slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years due to slowing iphone sales in china, raising anxieties that other companies could follow suit in a nod to the ramifications of ongoing trade tensions between the u.s. and china.
nervous investors seek refuge in yen and gold. wsj's ira iosebashvili: uneven economic data and volatility in stocks have accelerated a surge into assets perceived as relatively safe, highlighting the unease felt by many investors at the start of 2019. the japanese yen is up nearly 5% against the dollar since markets began sliding at the end of last year's third quarter. that move picked up speed after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and a sales warning from apple inc. last week bolstered fears of a global slowdown.
other so-called haven assets are also rising. gold prices have strengthened around 7% in that period and stand near their highest level in about half a year, and gold-focused funds have notched inflows in 12 of the past 13 weeks ... the broad shift toward havens suggests that investors are now more eager to diversify their holdings in the face of recent market swings.
america is a world leader ... in volatility. bloomberg's justina lee: as the world's largest and deepest equity market, the u.s. tends to be the relatively steady hand among volatile peers. not anymore. the country is at the epicenter of global market anxieties from trade to monetary tightening and an economic slowdown. the u.s. gauge of future volatility, the vix, has exceeded the equivalents in europe, hong kong and even emerging markets a few times over the past month. this is an anomaly that's become more commonplace since the market sell-off in february 2018.
— powell attempts a soft landing. wsj's greg ip, nick timiraos and eric moriath: federal reserve officials, after navigating the u.s. economy through the financial crisis and its rebound, face a fresh test in 2019: engineering an economic soft landing. the central bank's challenge is to manage a moderation in growth that keeps inflation contained but avoids a recession. it was a main topic at an annual economic conference in atlanta this weekend that featured top current and former fed officials. investors will look this week to talks by fed chairman jerome powell and vice chairman richard clarida for new clues on the officials' thinking, as well as wednesday's release of minutes from the fed's december meeting.
goldman sees fed pausing. jan hatzius, the firm's chief economist, writes in a note this morning: fed officials are acutely focused on both financial conditions and the growth outlook, at a time when they have the luxury to be 'patient' because core pce inflation is at 1.9% year-on-year and unlikely to rise significantly for at least the next several months. this implies a pause in the rate hike process until conditions have settled down, as well as a strong incentive to sound market-friendly in the near term.
— a majority of britons want a brexit re-do. cnbc: more britons want to remain a member of the european union than leave, according to a survey published on sunday which also showed voters want to make the final decision themselves. britain is due leave the eu on march 29, but prime minister theresa may is struggling to get her exit deal approved by parliament, opening up huge uncertainty over whether a deal is possible, or even whether the country will leave at all.
the survey by polling firm yougov showed that if a referendum were held immediately, 46 percent would vote to remain, 39 percent would vote to leave, and the rest either did not know, would not vote, or refused to answer the question. when the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favor of remaining. that is broadly in line with other polls in recent months which show a deeply divided electorate, in which opinion has swung slightly towards remaining in the eu.
— trade talks with china finally get underway. cnn's donna borak: trump claims his administration is 'doing very well in negotiations with china,' but the us team heading to beijing this week is starting almost from scratch. while china has made some preemptive concessions in the weeks since trump met with his counterpart xi jinping in argentina, including lowering auto tariffs and restarting purchases of american soybeans, little concrete progress has been made toward developing a comprehensive trade agreement between beijing and washington.
instead, the meeting of deputy-level negotiators will give each side a chance to take stock and serve as a litmus test for whether a deal can be achieved before march 1, when trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and to raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%. 'next week's negotiations are important because they will establish expectations,' said myron brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the us chamber of commerce. 'however, we shouldn't expect major breakthroughs next week.'
positive sign? liu he joins talks. bloomberg: chinese vice premier liu he unexpectedly attended the first day of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, according to people familiar with the matter and a photo seen by bloomberg. liu is the top economic adviser to chinese president xi jinping, who led previous negotiations in washington that produced a deal that president donald trump then repudiated. china had previously said the talks would be led by a lower-ranking official from the ministry of commerce.
chinese economy slows as trade talks loom. wsj's lingling wei: china's economy is slowing faster than expected as beijing this week heads into a crucial new round of negotiations with the u.s. over trade. for the past couple of months, senior chinese officials have sought to play down the impact of u.s.-china trade tensions on the world's second-largest economy, telling the public the conflict is doing little more than hurting the nation's stock indexes, making it a good time to buy china again. ...
[but] the trump administration's trade offensive, say the people and business executives, is hitting china's export-oriented manufacturing sector especially hard, reducing new orders for business and forcing factories to cut production and delay decisions on investing and hiring.
u.s. has leverage in trade talks, trump says. alan rappeport and jim tankersley at the new york times: trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the united states has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on monday in beijing. it helps his case that the labor department published a jobs report for december that soared past expectations.
'china's not doing very well now,' mr. trump said in a news conference at the white house, hours after the report came out on friday. 'it puts us in a very strong position. we are doing very well.' mr. trump is correct about china's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by american tariffs on $250 billion worth of chinese imports. but the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats.
meet in the middle? given the stakes, horizon investment's greg valliere predicts progress. both sides have compelling reasons to act – china quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and donald trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, he writes in his morning note. thus we believe there will be a constructive statement tomorrow, with hints that high-level officials will meet later this month to hammer out an agreement in principle.
— tariffs, not jobs for the industrial u.s. peter s. goodman at the nyt: plants in every direction shut down and moved their operations to mexico, succumbing to the relentless pressure to cut costs in an age of globalization. not ebw electronics. as the decades passed, the family-owned business stayed put, on the eastern edge of lake michigan, churning out lights for the auto industry. but now, the company's management is reluctantly mulling the possibility of moving its production to mexico to escape the tariffs that president trump has put on imported components, his primary weapons in a trade war waged in the name of bringing jobs home to america.
'it's killing us,' said the chairman of the company, pat leblanc, 63, a republican who voted for mr. trump. he now expects the president's tariffs will chop his 2019 profits in half. 'i just feel so betrayed. if we fail because the company is being harmed by the government, that just makes me sick.' across the industrial united states, including in the crucial political battleground state of michigan, such complaints are intensifying as the trade war disrupts factory operations that depend on imported parts.
— on the front lines of the app wars. the post's brian fung: a growing number of software companies are looking to bypass the dominant app store gatekeepers at apple and google — selling their services directly to consumers and undercutting the tech giants that for years have controlled how most of iphone and android users discover, download and pay for their apps.
the revolt is being led by companies such as netflix, which became the latest firm to cut off a lucrative relationship for apple when it confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through itunes. instead, subscribers are being redirected to make payments on netflix's own website. ... netflix's announcement could save it hundreds of millions of dollars, and is potentially devastating for apple.
— when box stores use a tax loophole, small towns bear the brunt. nyt's patricia cohen: with astonishing range and rapidity, big-box retailers and corporate giants are using an aggressive legal tactic to shrink their property tax bills, a strategy that is costing local governments and school districts around the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. these businesses — many of them brick-and-mortar stores like walmart, home depot, target, kohl's, menards and walgreens that have faced fierce online competition — maintain that no matter how valuable a thriving store is to its current owner, these warehouse-type structures are not worth much to anyone else.
so the best way to appraise their property, they contend in their tax appeals, is to look at the sale prices on the open market of vacant or formerly vacant shells in other places. as shuttered stores spread across the landscape, their argument has resonated. to municipalities, these appeals amount to a far-fetched tax dodge that allows corporations to wriggle out of paying their fair share.
— possible liquidation looms over sears. bloomberg news's eliza ronalds-hannon, lauren coleman-lochner, nabila ahmed, lily katz and tiffany kary: sears holdings corp. is preparing a potential wind down after chairman eddie lampert's bid to buy several hundred stores out of bankruptcy fell short of bankers' qualifications ... the iconic retailer started laying the groundwork for a liquidation after meetings friday in which its advisers weighed the merits of a $4.4 billion bid by lampert's hedge fund to buy sears as a going concern ... if the 125-year-old retailer does die in bankruptcy — like toys r us in 2018, and borders group inc. in 2011 — it would mark the largest fatality yet in the retail apocalypse prompted by a shift to online shopping.
here's what you missed at president trump's jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (monica akhtar/the washington post)
— shutdown drags on with no end in sight. the post's bob costa and co.: trump administration officials began taking extraordinary steps to contain the fallout from the partial federal government shutdown sunday, as the budget impasse between the president and congressional democrats showed no signs of nearing a breakthrough.
as agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting white house budget director russell t. vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. it demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border...
a democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the white house hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.

ellen degeneres encourages kevin hart to still host the oscars
on wednesday, in a dramatic exchange at the steps of the u.s. supreme court, he confronted ohio secretary of state jon husted, a republican, whom he believed was ultimately responsible for twice barring him from casting ballots.
but after video of the encounter circulated online, cleveland.com and husted's surrogates noted that husted had nothing to do with helle's removal. the process for canceling his registration was actually set in motion when husted's predecessor, democrat jennifer brunner, was secretary of state.
i've made it my mission as secretary of state to make ohio a place where it is both easy to vote and hard to cheat and by any objective measure we have achieved this goal, husted said in a statement emailed to the washington post.
it is now easier for ohioans serving in the military to vote than at any time in our state's history, he added, pointing to the state's early voting program, online registration and military ready-to-vote program as examples.
helle said his message remained the same.
we shouldn't be purging service members or veterans, or any ohioans for that matter, he told the post on friday.
for helle, the moment was more than six years in the making. in 2011, he returned from tours in iraq and afghanistan and tried to vote in a local election, only to be told that poll workers couldn't find his name. a couple of months later, in the general election, he was blocked again. this time, board of elections officials revealed he had been removed from the state's roll due to inactivity.
i started crying, helle told the post. to come home after defending that fundamental right and to be told that i couldn't exercise it, that was heartbreaking.
ohio's voter registration rules are some of the country's most punitive. voters who fail to cast ballots for two years receive a notice in the mail. if they don't respond, change their registration or vote in the following four years, they are purged from the rolls.
since 2011, the practice has been overseen by husted, who, like other supporters of such measures, says it is necessary to curb fraud and ensure the integrity of the state electoral system. the democratic secretary of state before him used the practice as well.
but a group of ohioans like helle allege they were wrongfully disenfranchised under the use-it-or-lose-it policy, as it's casually known. purporting to represent thousands of other similarly situated ohioans, they sued husted in federal court, arguing the policy violates the u.s. constitution and voting rights law. they were joined by the american civil liberties union of ohio and a homeless advocacy group.
on wednesday morning, after the lawsuit climbed through the lower courts over 18 months, the supreme court held closely watched oral arguments in the case.
the justices peppered the attorneys for the parties with questions about whether the policy was a reasonable and legally sound way for the state to prune its voter lists. but the real fireworks happened outside.
when husted emerged from the building, helle was waiting for him, flanked by supporters and camera crews.
we believe our state is one where we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat, husted told helle, according to npr. we make every effort possible to reach out to voters to get them registered to vote.
helle, who is not a plaintiff in the litigation, pushed back.
i never received any such notice, he told husted, because i was an active-duty soldier that maintained my home of record in the state of ohio, came back home after defending that right, and could not exercise it because of this archaic, terrible policy.
video of the exchange captured by cleveland.com showed the two standing just a few feet apart as a group of onlookers watched. husted pursed his lips as he listened to helle talk. helle, he said, didn't seem to grasp the policy.
all you have to do is use your right to vote, husted said.
from a mountainside, sir? responded helle, a former airborne infantry sergeant.
husted told him the registration process took only minutes.
what about soldiers serving overseas anywhere in the world, riding around in a humvee, conducting missions 20 hours a day? helle asked. what i know is that i was wrongfully purged.
you weren't wrongfully purged, husted said. he then walked off, with helle and several people behind him chanting shame.
as political theater, it seemed to work well for the 31-year-old veteran-turned-politician, who recently announced that he was running for the ohio house of representatives, hoping to unseat a republican incumbent.
husted is running for ohio lieutenant governor on a ticket with ohio attorney general mike dewine, who is running for governor
brunner, husted's predecessor, in 2007 and again in 2009 ordered county election boards to take steps that resulted in people like helle being scrubbed, cleveland.com reported friday. under her directives, the boards mailed notices to anyone who hadn't voted in two years and hand't confirmed their address. if the voters didn't reply to the mailings or vote in back-to-back elections, their names got deleted.
helle first registered to vote in 2004, when he was 18. after joining the army, he was sent to alaska, then deployed in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom between 2006 and 2011. he told the post he tried to vote absentee from overseas, but his ballot never made it to ohio.
county officials sent helle a confirmation letter in 2008, then removed him as a registered voter on jan. 13, 2011 after he didn't respond, according to cleveland.com. husted had been in office for three days at that point. helle learned of the move when he tried unsuccessfully to vote in two elections later that year.
carol ann hill, director of the ottawa county board of elections, said local officials, not husted, were responsible for the decision.
no. all 88 counties follow the law, hill told cleveland.com. the secretary of state does not say 'ok, now it's time to remove these voters.'
by all appearances on wednesday, helle blamed husted for disenfranchising him. following their confrontation, a tweet went out from helle's twitter account reading: i was able to speak my truth to the man who silenced my vote.
but he now suggests otherwise. and the tweet, helle said, was written by a member of his team.
i've never publicly, to my recollection, stated jon husted was specifically responsible, he told the post in an email. however, while in dc i did have someone using my twitter for me, to which they made an honest mistake and wrote a tweet that said i faced the person who purged me. it's since been corrected.
helle, who was elected mayor of oak harbor in 2015, said his involvement with the voter purge case was a pure accident.
when he learned he was removed from ohio's rolls, nobody really cared about the issue, he told the post. years later, after putting the issue behind him, he stumbled across a facebook post about the supreme court case and left a comment about what he went through. the left-leaning interest group progress ohio took notice, as did the aclu, he said. soon after, the calls started coming in from news organizations and advocacy groups.
his trip to washington on wednesday was paid for by an organization affiliated with one of the plaintiffs, he said. he woke up at 2 a.m., drove two hours to the airport in detroit and boarded a predawn flight. by late morning, he was on capitol hill.
before his confrontation with husted, he gave a short speech about voting rights outside the high court. sen. sherrod brown (d-ohio) joined him in front of the portico, where the senator told reporters his state was engaging in wholesale eliminating names of people who have served our country or people who haven't.
voter fraud is rare in both ohio and nationwide. probes of supposed voting irregularities routinely fail to turn up evidence of widespread or even marginal instances of it. in ohio, husted's own review of the 2016 election referred a mere 52 cases of possible fraud for prosecution or further investigation, as cleveland.com reported.
helle, who returned to oak harbor late wednesday, said he was glad for the chance to look this gentleman in the eye that's driving the cart and ask him why this is worth removing servicemen and women from voter rolls.
the secretary of state, he said, is out of touch.
to illustrate how different he and saban are, he pulls up a graphic on his phone. the text comes from dr. chenavis evans, a psychologist who works with alabama, nfl franchises and other colleges in her job as the owner and ceo of critical insights consulting. evans profiles the personalities of the coaches and players to help maximize how they work together. kiffin's profile comes up as a conceptual thinker. you'll like this, kiffin says with a smile. it means i'm imaginative, intuitive about ideas, visionary, enjoys the unusual and learns by experimenting.
he laughs: doesn't that explain me and everything that's not in the staff room at alabama?
he then points out that saban and a majority of the crimson tide staff are labeled structural: practical thinker, likes guidelines, cautious with new ideas, predictable and learns by doing.
but trump has no choice but to try to create an imperfect enemy if he wants to attack election results in georgia. it's a state run entirely by republicans, and raffensperger is the republican in charge of elections there.
here's more about the republican standing in the way of trump's remarkable attempt to change the will of voters in one of the most important states of the 2020 presidential election.
in a phone call on jan. 2, president trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. here are excerpts from the call. (obtained by the washington post)
raffensperger drew national attention as a candidate for secretary of state during the 2018 georgia governor's race. the then-secretary of state, republican brian kemp, was running for governor against democrat stacey abrams. she narrowly lost and accused kemp of using his role as secretary of state to disenfranchise democratic voters.
raffensperger was running that year to take kemp's place as the top election official. he was and has been supportive of kemp's questionable maneuvers to purge voter rolls (which require people to re-register to vote) and of strict voter id laws. as the fix's aaron blake recaps, in 2019 raffensperger purged about 4 percent of georgia voters from voter registration, a move critics labeled undemocratic. he was also critical of absentee voting before the pandemic; like many republicans, he argued it opened the door to fraud.
his next high-profile moment in the job came in june, during georgia's presidential primaries. these were among the first major primaries of the pandemic, and they didn't go well. there were hours-long lines, particularly in democratic-leaning communities in and around atlanta, and poll workers struggled to handle new voting machines. voting rights advocates said georgia election officials didn't prepare enough for the increase in mail balloting. abrams directly blamed raffensperger for inaction, poor planning and horrific execution. raffensperger said much of the trouble was the fault of democratic county officials.
before running as secretary of state, raffensperger was a city council member outside atlanta, and he's a multimillionaire businessman and an engineer by training.
he's a trump supporter. or at least he was before all of this. trump endorsed him in his secretary of state race. raffensperger said he voted for the president and was rooting for him to win georgia.
in the week after the election, georgia was still counting votes, and pressure by trump and his allies was just ramping up on the secretary of state. here's what raffensperger told the washington post's reis thebault and amy gardner at the time: if people want to understand what i'm doing, i'm just doing what the law says. we're just going to do that. do i hope that president trump wins? yeah, i certainly do. i'm a republican. but i can't put my thumb on the scale of the process.
raffensperger hasn't denounced trump or the republican party. but the more trump escalates pressure on him, the sharper raffensperger's criticism of the president's efforts has become.
there's no love lost between him and the two republican senators from georgia. once allies, sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler were some of the first georgia republicans to turn on raffensperger after it became clear trump had lost the state.
they called on raffensperger to resign but offered no actual evidence for why. raffensperger's response was biting: if i was senator perdue, i'd be irritated i was in a runoff. the drama has some republican strategists worried that the party is least unified when it most needs to be to win tuesday's runoffs in two races that will determine which party controls the senate.
he's outing republicans who have tried to pressure him to change results. in november, raffensperger told the post's gardner that sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) called him and asked if he could toss thousands of mailed ballots based on baseless concerns about whether election workers properly confirmed voters' signatures. graham denied explicitly asking raffensperger to throw out legal ballots, but raffensperger was insistent: it sure looked like he was wanting to go down that road, he said.
he and his family have received death threats: you better not botch this recount. your life depends on it. that's one text he shared with the post. his office has said his wife received threats they characterized as sexualized. someone broke into one of his adult children's homes.
as he presided over the election, then three counts confirming former vice president joe biden's narrow win in the state, raffensperger accepted a security detail.
he's also defended election workers in his state, saying they are driven to accurately count results and are not part of some deep-state conspiracy to swing the election for biden.
he's become one of the most forceful voices against trump and his republican allies' attempts to overturn the election. raffensperger has pushed back against broad accusations that the election he presided over was somehow fraudulent.
but he's also used his authority as secretary of state to directly confront conspiracy theories about voting machines having been manipulated or ballots cast by mail having been improperly approved. he's presided over three recounts — one by hand, which is the most secure way to confirm that machines and people counted ballots properly. and he acquiesced to one of trump's demands to review signatures on the outside of voters' envelopes to confirm they match the signature the state had on file for that voter. each time, they found no evidence of widespread fraud — as he told the president in that phone call.
president trump, he said in that call saturday, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. we don't agree that you have won.
this is what it looks like when your party is losing: scapegoating, finger-pointing, he told the post in a december emailed statement.
in december, he gave the green light for a top gop election official who reports to him to hold a news conference and directly address trump and tell him to stop leading people to believe georgia's election was fraudulent: someone's going to get hurt, said an angry gabriel sterling, who manages voting systems for raffensperger. someone's going to get shot. someone's going to get killed.
raffensperger on monday said of the leaked call that trump first betrayed confidence about the conversation. it was a private conversation as far as i was concerned, raffensperger told an atlanta reporter in an interview. he broke privacy when he put out a tweet, but then his tweet was false.
relocation: just moved is a state of being that makes just about any place seem miserable. plus, homesickness is normal after leaving a place you loved. plus, pregnancy could be heightening your emotions and attachments. so, make the best of this by recognizing, to start, that your feelings are 1.) normal and 2.) going to change sooner rather than later.
note that i didn't say they'd change for the better, necessarily; a year from now you might still believe moving was a mistake. but you'll have had a year to adjust and you'll have your routines, and basics like going to the grocery store won't feel alien anymore.
of course, your pregnancy means you'll have other changes to adapt to, but that's a variable we can't account for yet besides never sleeping or leaving the house — i kid! — so i'll leave it out. it could make you glad you moved or regret your move even more.
anyway, the key to starting over as an adult is, in my experience, patience + effort + an open mind. strong new roots can take years, and those years can be difficult.
should you decide for some reason that the new location will never be what you'd hoped and that you want to return to the old one, owning a home makes that decision complicated but not impossible. people uproot at inconvenient times — it's just a fact of life; that's why houses get rented and, even, losses get absorbed.
thinking this way tends to undermine the patience-and-open-mind plan, though, so i suggest you consider it, rule it out for now and really invest in your new place. you moved for a reason, and it may still hold up — after this initial panic clears.
re: stressful: they say the stressful life changes are marriage, death, divorce, babies, moving, buying a house and starting a new job. you have a few of those. and hormones. you are possibly isolated and alone because you are in a new place. do you know anyone nearby to connect with? can you find a new moms' group? when i had my first kid, i felt isolated, and i had lived in that city for quite some time. i had no friends with kids. i presume you have limited time and energy to socialize between work and being pregnant, but try, at least, to make the best of it, and make an informed decision after having more data.
re: moving: five years after i bought at the top of the market, i got a job on the opposite coast and the market tanked, so my home was unsellable without a massive loss. i found a manager, rented it out, and it has been great to have the income and the tax deduction. there is nothing that can't be survived.
anonymous: surmounted, let's say, and thanks.
on friday, trump will address the march from the white house rose garden via satellite, according to organizers. but as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. at minimum, they agree, trump welcomed their movement back into the white house and treats them with respect.
but that may be where the agreement about trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.
some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. still others say that trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other gop presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.
as someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . those of us who said, 'he's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said charles camosy, an ethics and theology professor at fordham university who writes books and articles about abortion. but when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. and what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'grab 'em by the p—y' guy?
the annual march for life brings many thousands of people to the mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. it marks roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy.
american views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. but the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby white house and which party leads congress.
during the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and planned parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. at this point, the analysis of trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including vice president pence (who spoke at last year's march) and charmaine yoest, longtime leader of americans united for life and now a top communications executive at the department of health and human services.
for abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (democrats who oppose abortion access, republicans who believe in protecting it) and the democratic party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.
upon trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion supreme court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from planned parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.
justice neil m. gorsuch, before he became trump's supreme court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. however, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.
the other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.
the house a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the hyde amendment — permanent, but the senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. the house also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the senate is seen as unlikely to pass.
when it comes to planned parenthood, the house and senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. under president barack obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from planned parenthood and other abortion clinics; trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.
marjorie jones dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of planned parenthood. everything is still in progress, she said.
i don't know if i have any data on how pro-lifers feel about trump in general, dannenfelser said. but 'never trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. trump is a pro-life hero, she said.
it's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. we are encouraged, hopeful. the issue isn't buried. candidates speak about it. it's not a movement in the ghetto. after eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the white house at the start of the administration — i felt like i was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.
while dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. about 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the guttmacher institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by planned parenthood.
kristan hawkins, leader of students for life, blamed congress for the stalled agenda. before the election, hawkins had been skeptical of trump's history and commitment, but after he won, she has regularly raved about him in breitbart, posted photos of herself with him and her baby and said she'll urge activists at the march to press harder.
we're pretty disappointed that the gop senate and house have still failed to fully defund planned parenthood — that was and continues to be our no. 1 legislative priority. this is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. i think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'we've elected them. they'll do what they say.' no, they're not doing what they said. you need to push them.
march organizers announced wednesday that trump would address the event via satellite. they noted that presidents ronald reagan and george w. bush had addressed the march by telephone, reagan in 1987 and bush in 2008.
abortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done.
it seemed a year ago that trump, with the leadership of the gop in congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said heather boonstra, director of public policy at guttmacher. that also included the defunding of planned parenthood. this was a very real item and real concern for us. i think it goes to show how the republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.
we do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, boonstra said.
the core goals aside, antiabortion advocates had a list of things they were happy about.
among them was the administration's expansion of the mexico city policy, which withholds u.s. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. the policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the white house, but trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. past gop presidents had limited it to the money the united states gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.
also mentioned was a recent rule change enacted by the department of health and human services exempting religious employers who objected to an obama-era requirement that they cover employees' contraceptives. that is being challenged by several states.
antiabortion advocates have been pleased with the trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.
but some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: gop leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.
it feels like it was with bush, said bart stupak, a former michigan congressman and a democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the affordable care act. it's all political posturing. the only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the house's attempt at the 20-week ban.
jayd henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.
at the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the conscience protection act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.
henricks said he didn't notice trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. i think [the trump era is] changing clearly the character of the republican party, he said. some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less republican.
some activists said the national divisiveness over trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. that fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.
i certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said kelsey hazzard, president of secular pro-life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a hillary clinton presidency. president trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. his boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.
over and over, she then turned to family members briefly granted access to their loved one, their newly tear-stained faces also hidden behind layers of fabric and plastic. and over and over, she has found the strength to help them mourn — pushing aside the knowledge that she can never know for certain whether they, too, are infected.
she says mustering this strength, at least in public, has been part of how she survived this difficult year. but when she sat down next to a hospital doctor to be vaccinated a few days before christmas, becoming one of the first faith leaders in the world to do so, she couldn't stop the tears.
i told the doctor: 'i'm a little bit weepy today because, like . . . i don't know how to explain it,'  said jennie, who asked religion news service to withhold her last name so she could speak freely about her experience. she looked at me and was like, 'i was the same way. out of all this darkness, hope is on the horizon.'
variations of this complicated feeling — a mixture of hope, euphoria and lingering despair — were reported to rns by a number of hospital chaplains who were vaccinated in recent days. even while they rolled up their sleeves to join other front-line workers as some of the first to be gifted with human-made immunity to the novel coronavirus, many reflected on the work that led them to the historic moment — jobs that are sometimes harrowing, sometimes beautiful and always deeply felt.
some chaplains who spoke to rns expressed surprise that they were included in the first round of vaccinations.
chaplains have a really valuable role on the care team, but it's not all the time we are told, 'you're just as important,'  jennie said.
but even as protocols and systems vary depending on the hospital or the state, the exposure many chaplains have to covid-19 is very real. daniel russell, a fuller seminary graduate who works as a hospital and hospice chaplain in the los angeles area, regularly visits covid units. before each session, he stops at the black tape that marks the entrance to the covid hallway to don gloves, a gown and a papr — a futuristic white helmet that encases his entire face.
then he enters a patient's room, taps on a phone or ipad, and holds it aloft so family members can see their loved one via video chat. sometimes, if the patient is not intubated, they talk. sometimes they pray together. sometimes the families burst into songs, or even hymns.
it's so clear, every time, that their loved one is so loved, he said. as a chaplain, it's okay to tear up. but the amount of crying i've done this year . . . it's hard.
all chaplains who spoke to rns reported a notable change in the tenor of their conversations with others this year. the rev. andy karlson, a unitarian universalist chaplain for st. mary's hospital in madison, wis., observed patients are open to longer conversations because there's just a loneliness. anxiety is paramount, as are profound questions about why a greater power would allow them or their loved one to suffer.
and even when they don't hear such questions from patients, they hear them from medical personnel.
we do as much staff support as we do patient support, karlson said, noting that while all such conversations are part of his job as a chaplain, they also put him at risk of exposure.
indeed, covid-19 has not spared faith leaders who serve the sick. in april, a chaplain at nyu langone health, rabbi mordecai katz, succumbed to the disease.
and then there's the emotional and spiritual toll. russell, who is pursuing ordination with the free methodist church, said he began lighting candles as part of his advent practice when he returned home at night and has continued doing so. as the death toll mounts, he has taken to thinking of each patient who died that day as he sets each wick alight. he said it can be overwhelming.
this is really the first time i've processed all of this, russell said.
these and other experiences created the backdrop for hospital chaplains across the country as they received emails this month informing them they were in line to receive the vaccine. again, systems vary: some chaplains have already gotten the vaccine; others told rns they expect to receive it sometime in the next month, and still others aren't sure when they will get the shots.
but regardless of when they get the vaccine, many say their decision to do so will be driven in part by faith-fueled altruism. the rev. hiram l. brett, chaplain and coordinator of spiritual services at connecticut mental health center, recently told the yale school of medicine that his choice to get vaccinated was informed by his faith and his desire to quell vaccine hesitancy among religious groups — particularly his fellow african american christians.
i'm a preacher, so i have to say this: in this situation i would lean to faith as opposed to fear, brett said. if you're choosing to keep yourself exposed to the virus with the potentiality that you don't know how it will affect you or your loved ones, are you letting fear drive you? i would opt toward faith and lean to the vaccine.
karlson said he talked with his family about getting the shot, and acknowledged it made him a little afraid. but he also felt driven to set a good example for his children — i want them to see their dad doing his part, he said.
and, like brett, he felt compelled by his faith.
i trust god will be with me, he said. i can lean into my faith for this.
when he finally pulled up his shirt to receive the vaccine — a quick, almost painless prick just beneath a tattoo — he suddenly found himself engulfed by the enormity of it all.
i was trying to play it cool, but i could feel the gravity, the weight of the pandemic, he said. we're having a 9/11 of deaths every day. we've had to remap the structure of our whole society. we're facing this exacerbated wealth gap — communities of color and people on the margins are being hit incredibly hard by this. feeling that, as i was taking off my sweater and rolling up my sleeves . . . it was heavy, and hopeful.
jennie felt similarly. although some have invoked faith as a reason to resist vaccines or mask-wearing during the pandemic, she saw the shot as an embodiment of jesus christ's command to care for others.
the golden rule is treating your neighbor as yourself, she said. i would hope my neighbor would care for my well-being enough to also get the vaccine, and to protect themselves and me and others they interact with. so why would i not do the same?
as for russell, the moment took on a liturgical significance. for him, the pandemic has been shrouded in shadows: he often works nights, shuffling around hospital hallways that could feel barren even before the pandemic. it has been grueling, difficult work, and he stressed it is far from over: vaccine rollout will take many months, and patients will still need him after the pandemic, coronavirus or no.
important things will continue to happen at night; the christmas story, after all, occurred in darkness.
we continue to show up for them, he said. we continue to grieve.
but as the pfizer vaccine entered his arm on dec. 17 — just four days before the winter solstice — he recalled that even in a year plagued with sorrow, there have been moments of joy. at his hospital, staff have developed a ritual of sorts: whenever a patient recovers and is released from the covid unit, they play the song here comes the sun by the beatles.
perhaps, he thought, morning has finally come.
the days are going to begin to get longer again, and i felt such a sense of joy — like christmas really was here, he said. it's actually happening. the sun is coming.
while models yesterday suggested that the snow would stay well south of washington, their forecasts have crept the northern boundary of the snow back into the metro region.
we want to stress that this is a particularly tough forecast. whenever a location is on the edge of a storm, the forecast can change significantly due to even small shifts in the storm track and intensity.
for the district and interstate 95 corridor, the forecast could go either way: we could see no snow or perhaps up to an inch or so. the national weather service suggests that we have between a 20 and 30 percent chance of one inch of snow saturday.
for our southeast areas in calvert and st. mary's county, shifts in the storm track could have more profound implications, meaning the difference between a dusting of snow and up to three to six inches.
the most likely timing of any snow in the region is between the pre-dawn hours saturday and midday. the snow could potentially last longer into the afternoon in areas well east of the district toward the chesapeake bay, depending on how close the storm tracks.
locations north and northwest of the city still have a good chance of escaping snow unless the storm track makes a fairly dramatic shift in their direction.
wednesday's various model runs generally kept the precipitation shield suppressed to our south and east. the gfs even kept the northern edge of the snow shield confined to north carolina.
that same model (the gfs) now predicts two to four inches in a six-hour period saturday morning across southern calvert and st. mary's counties with snow coming perilously close to the district.
the high resolution nam model (see below) is the most aggressive with the northern edge of the precipitation, forecasting one to two inches of snow in washington on saturday morning. that seems to be a long shot but is not a totally insane forecast if the storm tracks a bit west of its current forecast.
a more likely result for washington would be for the snow to stay just to the south or for the city to get a dusting.
the farther north and west of the city you live, the better your chances for seeing no snow.
why have models shifted the snow northward?
a comparison of the upper level (high-altitude) and surface forecasts from last night and today valid at 4 a.m. saturday (see images to the right) provides insight into why the models have edged the precipitation field northward.
let's look first at the southernmost green areas at upper levels (500 millibars). note that the jet stream, portrayed by the u-shape in the green shading, dips farther south into tennessee on today's map compared to last night's forecast. also notice that the same green shade is a tad farther north in our area today than last night. this indicates the upper flow over our area is little more from the south today than last night — which helps the storm come farther north.
also, as a result of the more pronounced jet stream dip (green dip) over tennessee, the 1016 millibar surface pressure contour (black line off the southeast coast) is north of where last night's was. that indicates low pressure has shifted north a bit.
additional changes to these features could either nudge the precipitation shield back to the south a bit or allow it to edge north.
the bottom line is the snow threat is still alive saturday from the district south. the farther south and east you live, the higher the probability of getting accumulating snow.
the city will probably only see a dusting to an inch if that. north of the city flurries or no snow at all looks like the best bet.
folks south and east of the city should really pay attention to their weather forecasts over the next 36 hours as any snow that falls will stick as the temperatures are expected to remain well below freezing.
then they'll go to halftime and start over.
alabama (14-0) has won its first quarters by a total score of 220-45, rendering unwise any late arrival to a crimson tide game no matter how highbrow the tuscaloosan tailgate. clemson (14-0) has won its second quarters by 211-38, allowing more time for pregame libations on the off chance any fans are into that.
sadly, alabama has cooled off in second quarters, winning them only 199-68 — the lousiness of it! — while clemson has won its first quarters by an unforgivable 107-38.
in game prep, one of the things that we do, we script plays, said michael locksley, the alabama offensive coordinator bound for maryland right after this episode. i script my first 15 plays, and they usually include different formations, personnel groupings, to be able to see defensively how they want to defend us so that we can start the chess match. i think we've been really good with how we've executed those plays. you know, we usually get them in to our players on thursdays, practice on fridays, walk through.
and so by the time we go to play the game, they've gone through these scripted 15 plays three times and i think their execution has been pretty good in those opening drives. we've been able to score points, and i attribute it to the way our guys have executed our opening script.
as the tide's weekly first waves became one of the foremost sub-themes of the season, alabama has executed so expertly that in most cases, the scoreboard might want to start off 7-0 just to save time. alabama has driven for a touchdown on the first possession in an absurd 11 of its 14 games. in the other three, it punted against lsu before getting around to scoring on its second possession, did the same against auburn, and it threw an interception against georgia in the sec championship game, which may or may not have related to the high-ankle sprain quarterback tua tagovailoa took on the fourth offensive play.
still, when georgia closed that first quarter with a 7-0 lead, most everyone would agree the game should have been stopped briefly for the bulldogs defenders to receive medals. brent venables, the formidable clemson defensive coordinator, called alabama the best offense that we've seen since i've been at clemson, top to bottom, and he has been at clemson since 2012.
i think you can get overwhelmed and feel like you're playing from behind, he said, soon adding, it can rattle your confidence. certainly, for oklahoma [in last weekend's college football playoff semifinal], what was it, 28-0? that's a hole that . . . you could still come [back], but it's gonna be really hard when you're playing somebody as good as alabama.
to come across this tide on a field, venables said, brings the realization that they're different from about everybody.
number one, they're a very physical team, clemson co-offensive coordinator jeff scott said. so they come out of the gate very physical. i think that happened last year [in alabama's 24-6 win over clemson in a national semifinal]. i don't think that we matched the physicality in the first quarter last year, and it really kind of hurt us getting a little bit of momentum going. obviously, they've got great coaches, they're gonna have a great plan. and part of the first quarter is kind of a feeling-out process, everybody kind of feeling out each other, and you know, they've done a great job, obviously.
then he said, and you know, for us this year, we've kind of been a second-quarter team.
as to what's going on with that, scott said, i don't know. we've talked about that as a staff.
he made an educated guess: a little bit of it, maybe, you've got a freshman quarterback [trevor lawrence], you've still got some young guys on the offense that even though they've been through a lot of battles, are still kind of feeling their way out. i remember that with deshaun's group a little bit their freshman and sophomore year — referring to deshaun watson of the nfl, formerly of clemson — we kind of got better as the game went, and then by deshaun's junior year, we got off to some really fast starts early. i think that comes with experience. but there's no doubt, we want to get off to a fast start, but you know, the same thing two years ago, i think we were down 14-0 [early in the second quarter, before winning, 35-31]. so there's some lessons to go if you get in that situation as well.
as venables reinforced, it's not like you say, 'look, this week, we don't have to start fast.'
as locksley explained, once you get into the second quarter, that's typically where you have an idea or a good feeling for how they want to defend you that day, and that's where you start the chess match of countering what they're doing and making adjustments to your calls or your game sheets, so obviously brent does a good job of making sure he kind of sees how we want to attack, when he starts to chess-match from his end.
if clemson has had its (relative) first-quarter sighs — tied 0-0 with florida state, trailing 6-0 to duke, tied 3-3 with notre dame last weekend — it looks to have mastered what to do after that, with its halftime scores such as 28-0 against florida state, 14-6 against duke and 23-3 against notre dame. to tosh lupoi, the alabama defensive coordinator, this owes to clemson's unusual array of capabilities, from its smashing freshman quarterback to its thrilling list of receivers — tee higgins, justyn ross, the eternal hunter renfrow — to its 1,572-yard running back, travis etienne.
you know, they've got a lot of talent out there, they have a lot of versatility with their offense, and they have the ability to respond to what you're showing them, lupoi said. . . . i think within the body of their offense, they have answers to the different looks that they see, and within our scheme, we do our best to respond to those looks and change those looks as well.
per usual, this quarter-by-quarter dance actually got going saturday afternoon california time. that's when alabama had its thursday practice in its hardcore weekly routine. that's when alabama finished with that, and that's when, as locksley said saturday morning, i'll sit down and start scripting those first 15.
trump ran through economic statistics with a salesman's delivery, crowing about growth during his three years in office that he said bested his predecessors and defied his skeptics.
america is thriving, america is flourishing, and, yes, america is winning again like never before, he told an audience of billionaires, world leaders, and figures from academia, media and the kind of international organizations and think tanks for which his america first nationalism is anathema.
but as the impeachment trial began in the senate during trump's long day of activity here, the president repeatedly pivoted away from his broader economic message to lash out against his domestic political foes and the effort to remove him from office.
read the transcripts! trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax.
trump is making his second visit to the world economic forum, which for its 50th anniversary this year is focusing on climate change and sustainability. a sign at the entrance to the news center notes that paint for this year's installation was made from seaweed and carpets from recycled fishing nets.
trump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge europe to use america's vast supply of oil and natural gas.
this is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism. fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, trump said.
in an apparent back of the hand to critics who say he is allowing massive backsliding on u.s. environmental progress, trump said the united states has its cleanest air and water in 40 years. and in remarks outside the hall, trump said he is a very big believer in the environment.
in his speech, trump made no mention of impeachment or u.s. politics, although he took a swipe at radical socialists, his term for democrats and ideas about expansion of the government's role in health care, education and other issues.
klaus schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked trump for injecting optimism into the discussion.
we have many problems in the world, but we need dreams, he said.
trump skipped an onstage question-and-answer session with schwab that had been expected following his address.
trump received a polite but not enthusiastic reception in the hall.
even as trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. the u.s. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. trump signed a partial trade deal with china last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.
but the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. his decision to order a strike that killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on european cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the middle east and in the transatlantic relationship between the united states and its closest allies.
trump was billed as the keynote speaker for the annual business-themed confab in this alpine ski town, but the main attraction was swedish climate activist greta thunberg, 17, who has sparred with trump on twitter.
our house is still on fire. your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour, she told conference attendees tuesday. and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.
in december, trump insulted the teenager and time magazine person of the year as so ridiculous and suggested that she work on her anger management problem.
thunberg was quick to respond, updating her twitter biography to describe herself as a teenager working on her anger management problem.
trump had not yet arrived in davos when thunberg gave her first address tuesday morning, saying that without treating this as a real crisis, then we cannot solve it. he did not attend her main speech later in the day, although she was in the audience for his.
trump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. the president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.
ahead of trump's address, schwab told the gathering that the world is in a state of emergency and that the window to address climate change is closing. he also reminded the audience that every voice heard at the forum deserved respect.
although climate change and environmental stewardship lead the agenda here, a survey of chief executives released monday shows that they do not count climate change as among the top 10 threats to business growth.
trump was accompanied here by treasury secretary steven mnuchin, white house economic adviser larry kudlow, and a delegation including national security adviser robert c. o'brien, trump's daughter ivanka trump and his son-in-law jared kushner. also present was adviser and speechwriter stephen miller, whose hard-line stance on limiting immigration and denunciations of globalism infused trump's address to the united nations in september.
this is the wreckage i was elected to clean up, trump said tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.
he praised himself repeatedly, saying that his actions saved the global economy from the brink of recession, rescued the u.s. manufacturing industry and reshaped the rules of international trade to reflect a fairer system.
he occasionally strayed from the facts as he tried to paint a picture of an economy in shambles before his election.
he described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the united states over the past 70 years. he also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.
he took a swipe at the federal reserve for its interest rate policies, saying his economic achievements came despite the rate-setting body. although his attacks on the fed have become common, the once-taboo practice seemed to startle some in the audience here.
some in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. but many business leaders here believe trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on.
i think he glossed over some of the more controversial issues on the environment, said steven collis, chief executive of amerisourcebergen, but he called it a surprisingly well-met speech overall.
marc benioff, chief executive of salesforce, has donated to several democratic candidates for president, but he applauded trump's announcement that the united states will join the trillion tree campaign to plant more trees to help reduce carbon emissions.
i'm very excited that the united states has joined the trillion tree initiative, benioff said as he left the speech.
trump is using his day-and-a-half-long visit to lobby corporate chieftains for greater u.s. investment and meet with leaders including pakistani prime minister imran khan, iraqi president barham salih and kurdish leader nechirvan barzani.
trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the united states. he did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported democrats over him in 2016. he also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.
more than 100 billionaires are on the official attendee list for the world economic forum, and trump plans to meet with the heads of several multinational companies while in davos.
during a dinner with foreign business executives tuesday, trump had a simple message.
around the table tonight, we have the greatest businessmen in the world, he said. this is a great time to promote what you want to promote.
we don't ever want to be outworked, reed said of his team's mentality to start the year. and we talk about trust often. trusting our staff and system but also trusting each other.
the team is led by senior big man qudus wahab, and their goal on offense is often to get the ball down low. wahab is one of four players on the roster taller than 6-foot-6. that provides the team with some versatility. an example: when wahab missed last week's game against bullis, 6-foot-10 transfer noel brown filled in admirably.
in the backcourt, the team starts three point guards. senior ethan jones, junior justice ellison and westfield transfer jordan hairston all provide different skillsets, but can each run the offense. when the huskies dominate the boards, something that isn't too difficult with their size, there's a good chance their outlet pass will find a point guard.
we don't have to get it to a certain player to make things happen, reed said. we trust all of them with the ball.
the huskies' distinctive roster makeup could help them stand out in a mid-atlantic conference that is packed with size and talent this season. reed said his team's first priority is to protect home court. they have not lost a game at flint hill since early 2017.
their second goal is to not get ahead of themselves. they want to keep stacking one-game win streaks, all the way through the postseason.
we all recognize that we have our best basketball ahead of us, reed said.
mount hebron wants to build something big
because jared ettinger coached mount hebron's junior varsity team before taking over the varsity squad this season, he knows all about the players and the team culture. and he knows mt. hebron has been a mediocre program over the past 10 years, with a winning percentage hovering around .500.
i want to build a community-based program that year in and year out sees sustained success, ettinger said. sustained success isn't always the best record or county championship. ... we want to build something with longevity — something where year in and year out we can have a program that expects better than a mediocre overall record.
it may sound like a lofty goal for a first-year head coach. but with players such as odell dickerson, a 6-foot-4 transfer from chapelgate christian averaging 21 points and eight rebounds, and brandon prox, whose 79 made threes last season was the most by a howard county public school player in the last decade, ettinger has the tools to begin strong. now, he's working on transitioning that talent into team chemistry and success.
the vikings finished last season by winning nine of their final 12 games. with an up-and-down season so far — they won four of their first five games but lost three of the last four — the vikings hope to make a similar run to push for the playoffs.
we're hoping to go on a similar run, but there's no pressure to replicate that, ettinger said. but if we want to go on a run, we're going to have to do the little things better, like running the offense off the ball, being more disciplined, working on the defensive glass.
osbourn takes down rival osbourn park
osbourn and osbourn park are no strangers, but the osbourn eagles found themselves in unfamiliar territory friday.
the eagles usually have no trouble handling the yellowjackets, but this time proved different, as new coach jeremy coleman and more offensive depth have made osbourn park stronger this season.
ultimately, thanks to the efforts of senior draykeau hogan and sophomore manny ojo, the eagles were able to secure a 69-58 win, their 11th straight victory against their rivals.
hogan had a career-high 27 points, and ojo sunk five three-pointers as the duo combined for 48 points. the two were also able to slow down osbourn park's top scorer, ethan wilson, who averages 22 points per game but had 19 in the game on just 26-percent shooting.
i'd argue we have two of the best guards in the area, osbourn coach rocky carter said. we got an incredibly unselfish team… we're very fortunate to have the guards that we have and very fortunate to have the team that we have.
osbourn (12-1) ranks second in the 6a division while osbourn park, who had won five straight prior to the loss, dropped to 5-8.
there's no night off in our district, there's no game we can look at that we can say, 'oh, we should win that one...' carter said. we must make sure that we do the little things correctly.
after close losses, eastern comes up clutch
entering its game against ron brown on friday night, eastern's previous three losses came by seven or fewer points. but the ramblers found themselves on the opposite end of a close game during their 71-68 win over the monarchs.
with about three seconds remaining and the game tied at 68, the officials called a technical foul on ron brown for having too many players on the court. guard christopher green sunk one of two free throws. on the ensuing possession, the monarchs fouled green, who drained two more shots from the charity stripe. ron brown didn't get off a shot at the buzzer.
i was like, 'we need this win because it's league play,' eastern guard darryl carter said.
eastern (7-5) went 11-18 last season, but carter said the ramblers' offense is more versatile this year with a deeper bench and more guards who can handle the ball.
carter said eastern focused on making smarter decisions and boxing out on offense during practices after their array of close defeats.
the ramblers play banneker on monday before tests against mckinley tech and wilson later this week.
it could boost our energy and confidence, carter said of friday's victory. we haven't reached our potential yet.

apollo 14 astronaut alan shepard conducts an experiment on the moon in february 1971. a research team used rocks that shepard and edgar mitchell brought back to earth to figure out the moon's age. the estimate is 4.51 billion years old. (nasa via ap)
it turns out the moon is older than many scientists suspected: a ripe 4.51 billion years old.
that's the newest estimate, thanks to rocks and soil collected by the apollo 14 moonwalkers in 1971.
a research team reported wednesday that the moon formed within 60 million years of the birth of the solar system. previous estimates ranged within 100 million years, all the way out to 200 million years after the solar system's creation, not quite 4.6 billion years ago.
the scientists conducted uranium-lead dating on fragments of the mineral zircon that were pulled from apollo 14 lunar samples. the pieces of zircon were tiny — no bigger than a grain of sand.
size doesn't matter, they record amazing information nonetheless! lead author melanie barboni of the university of california at los angeles, said in an email.
until recently, the moon was estimated to be millions of years younger. (matt cardy/getty images)
she noted that the moon holds so much magic . . . the key to understand how our beautiful earth formed and evolved.
some of the eight zircon samples were used in an earlier study, also conducted at ucla. barboni said she is studying more zircons from apollo 14 samples, but she doesn't expect it to change her estimate of 4.51 billion years for the moon's age, possibly 4.52 billion years at the most.
it would be more a double-checking than anything else, she explained.
she and her co-workers — whose research appeared wednesday in the journal science advances — are eager to learn more about the moon's history and, in turn, the evolution of early earth and the entire solar system.
apollo 11's alan shepard and edgar mitchell collected 92 pounds of rocks and used tubes to dig up soil while exploring the moon's fra mauro highlands in february 1971. they conducted two spacewalks, spending nine hours altogether out on the lunar surface.
it's the second major moon study this week.
on monday, israeli scientists suggested our earth's constant companion may actually be a melting pot of many mini-moons. rather than one giant impact that shaved off a chunk of earth and formed the moon, a series of smaller collisions may have created multiple moonlets that eventually merged into one, according to the researchers.
the giant-impact theory says that the resulting energy formed a lunar lava ocean that later became solid. it's the age that it became solid that barboni and her team have now figured out.
we finally pinned down a minimum age for the moon formation, she said, regardless of how it formed.
wells's obstetrician/gynecologist explained that the test, called a cell-free dna screen, analyzes the fetal genetic information that travels from the mother's placenta and poses no risk to the baby. the doctor had been routinely prescribing it for her patients who were older and higher risk, now she was prescribing it to younger women, as well.
the doctor's reasoning: women under 35 had more babies overall and account for 80 percent of country's 6,000 annual down births, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. she explained that the test was more accurate than the current standard of care for younger women, which can include other blood tests and an ultrasound to measure the fluid at the base of the fetus's neck that can signal the presence of down. plus, the parents could learn the gender during the first trimester if they wanted, rather than wait to see the baby's anatomy on the 20-week ultrasound.
it was an easy blood draw, and we didn't see a downside, says wells, a public relations specialist from baltimore. my husband and i hadn't discussed what we would do if we got a bad result, but i thought if we did, wouldn't we want to know as far in advance as possible?'
wells is part of a new wave of younger women gaining access to what is marketed as the noninvasive prenatal test (nipt). becoming available in 2011, the nipt was rapidly embraced by ob/gyns and covered by insurers for women over 35 because it was less risky than two other tests, amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (cvs), and more sensitive in picking up genetic abnormalities. it also could be performed earlier in pregnancy than amniocentesis.
in a 2015 study in the new england journal of medicine of nearly 16,000 pregnant women undergoing first trimester screening, cell-free dna testing detected the presence of trisomy 21, the marker for down syndrome, in 38 of 38 women, compared with just 30 of 38 women who were given current standard-of-care tests.
diana bianchi, director of the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development, argued that cell-free dna testing has led to a global transformation of prenatal care in an article last summer in the new england journal of medicine. not only did it spare women unnecessary angst from fewer falsely abnormal results than current methods, but the increased use of the nipt led to fewer invasive amniocentesis or cvs procedures that carry a small risk of miscarriage, she wrote.
today, as many insurers expand coverage of the test — and more women request it — more ob/gyns are making the nipt a standard offering for all patients. in 2017, nearly 60 percent of ob/gyns prescribed it to younger women — up from 35 percent the year before, according to the asset management firm piper jaffray.
yet the nipt's entry into the mainstream has raised some questions as busy health-care providers scramble to figure out how to offer it en masse to a public with varying understanding of genetic testing and little access to genetic counselors. sometimes, ob/gyns don't have time to explain the nuances of the tests before they order them, says ob/gyn neeta vora, who works as the director of reproductive genetics at the university of north carolina school of medicine.
that communication gap is further exacerbated by what houston prenatal genetic counselor blair stevens calls the elephant in the ob/gyn's office: some patients agree to take the nipt simply to learn the sex of their baby. they may not understand that the nipt is not 100 percent accurate and should be confirmed by a diagnostic amniocentesis or cvs. and they also might not be prepared for — or even expecting — the possible genetic problems the test can reveal.
when casey delperdang was pregnant with her son, simon, two years ago, she says the main appeal was the chance to learn she was carrying a boy. i was 25 at the time and wasn't even thinking about genetic abnormalities because of my age. i sort of took the test for granted, says delperdang, who works in health-care marketing in houston.
when she received her results, she and her husband threw a gender reveal party that involved an elaborate scavenger hunt leading guests to a tray of custom-made cupcakes. the blue frosting hidden inside indicated they were having a boy. i have a lot of similarly aged friends who've been pregnant recently, and it's not even a question that they get the test for the same reason. she said. thankfully, her test results were genetically normal.
although disclosing fetal sex information is forbidden in some countries — such as china and india — out of concern that girls will be selectively aborted, research shows that is not an issue in the united states. rather, blair says, she is worried about ­parents-to-be getting emotionally blindsided by upsetting genetic results.
as a culture, we've gotten so swept in gender reveal parties that we've forgotten the real purpose of the test, she says. i see women in my office with positive results who don't know what they've have their blood drawn for.
in addition to testing for down syndrome, a cognitive impairment disorder with a risk of heart defects, vision and hearing problems, the nipt also detects the rarer edwards and patau syndromes that occur in 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 16,000 births, respectively, and usually result in death shortly after birth.
despite the test's increase in popularity, public health experts have not uniformly embraced the technology as the preferred first-line test for all women — and some major insurers are not yet covering it for average-risk women, generally meaning under age 35.
for instance, in a 2016 bulletin advocating prenatal screening for women of all ages, the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists (acog) and the society for maternal-fetal medicine stopped short of explicitly endorsing the nipt.
we say that all women should be offered testing, but we don't recommend one kind, says nancy rose, a maternal fetal medicine physician at the university of utah health sciences center and a former genetics chair of acog. all these tests are good, and they all offer advantages and disadvantages. for example, some of the older blood tests also assess neural tube and ventral wall defects.
two years ago, six leading genetic nipt manufacturers and providers formed an alliance to expand coverage for the test and persuade two of the largest private insurers, unitedhealthcare and aetna, which cover more than 50 million people in the u.s. combined, to offer nipt for younger women.
both aetna and unitedhealthcare, which only cover nipt for high-risk pregnancies, said they cover traditional blood and ultrasound tests for younger women in line with the professional groups' recommendations.
acog is reviewing its position, says chris zahn, acog's vice president for practice activities. (a recent study suggested that nipt may also detect some ovarian and cervical cancers in the mother.)
there's new evidence every day about how this technology is expanding to detect abnormalities earlier, he says. but from a clinical perspective, we still need to figure out how to counsel women to think about the results.
at unc, vora teaches ob/gyn residents how to talk to patients about the nipt and genetic testing in general.
i encourage residents to ask the basics, such as, 'have you ever heard of down syndrome?'  she says. based on what patients say, you're obligated to spend more time with them and explain the general concepts of chromosomes.
vora's department is developing an educational program that patients can scroll through on an electronic tablet during an office visit. similarly, illumina, the san diego maker of dna sequencers used in 90 percent of nipt samples processed in the united states, plans to launch a multilingual app soon that patients could consult before or after an appointment.
part of adequately counseling women, stevens says, is realizing that not all women want to know everything modern science can tell them about their pregnancies. it causes them anxiety, she says. they don't want to know because they don't know what they would do with a positive result.
although a 2012 retrospective analysis of 24 studies found that 67 percent of u.s. women who learned their fetuses probably had down syndrome had terminated their pregnancies between 1995 to 2011, stevens says she also tells patients that they can use such information to prepare for a special-needs child by connecting with other parents or finding the right doctors and birth centers.
yet, unlike previous prenatal testing that might occur in the second trimester, some observers say the nipt is poised to change the american pregnancy experience as we know it — by making early testing a standard part of the ob/gyn checklist, whether a woman really wants it or not.
just the fact that it's routinely offered forces you into a decision, or you're an irresponsible mother, says vardit ravitsky, a bioethicist at the university of montreal who studies the social impact of prenatal testing. with an amniocentesis, you could say you didn't want to risk miscarriage, but with nipt, what's your excuse?
the focus on testing also could dampen the joy of those early months of pregnancy. it's no longer 'congratulations! you're pregnant!' it's 'here's a test to see what could be wrong,'  says barbara katz rothman, a sociologist at city university of new york and the author of tentative pregnancy: prenatal diagnosis and the future of motherhood. it induces a kind of anxiety that's not healthy.
yet for wells, receiving a negative nipt result before the end of her pregnancy's first trimester gave her peace of mind — and made her pregnancy more real.
it was a huge relief, she says. i thought, 'now we can tell people and celebrate.'
she and her husband declined to hold a gender reveal party, but they did engage in another modern ritual of pregnancy: a funny facebook post.
the couple took a photo of their two male cats posed next to an ultrasound image and a copy of book the expectant father.
but even the die-hard fans of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) that i talked to at his friday rally in columbia, s.c., didn't express much confidence in his chances, though they hoped it would be close. they had been phone banking or canvassing for him, and the experience had been discouraging.
they were much like so many of the sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. many of them were students at nearby colleges. when i asked one whether she'd attended any sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, i was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. like sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change.
but not enough south carolina democrats are like those hopeful college students or the rest of the people who had turned out to finlay park to hear sanders and his surrogates thunder about radical change. more than half of south carolina's democratic voters are african american, a demographic that former vice president joe biden does well with, rather than latinos and whites, with whom sanders is strong; they are older, more religious and less liberal than the ideal bernie electorate. too many of the people those sanders campaigners had tried to turn out were voting for biden, or elizabeth warren, or tom steyer.
paul taylor is a corner store cashier in an impoverished area of charleston, s.c. he is gay, black and a democrat. and he may vote for trump. (the washington post)
sure enough, even before polls closed, the sanders campaign had all but conceded the state; he wasn't even there to give his concession speech, even though he'd come in a (distant) second. the television talking heads who had been increasingly panicked about a sanders candidacy even began speculating that former new york mayor mike bloomberg could drop out and toss his massive ad buys to biden. (the bloomberg campaign hastened to announce he wouldn't.) the consensus was that we were now down to a two-man race, and that meant biden could easily go all the way.
i might be too pessimistic about biden's chances. it all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #nevertrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the orange menace.
i believed the fantasies back then, but i find it hard to allow myself to believe again. and the map isn't exactly helping to restore my faith.
yes, biden had a big win on saturday in south carolina. he's catching up to sanders in the delegate race, because south carolina has a lot of delegates, and he will probably have a big fundraising night. he should have a nice tail wind heading into super tuesday. but where is he going to win big?
looking at the polls, i'd expect him to take alabama, tennessee and probably north carolina. but is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in texas, where he is running eight points behind sanders and where the democratic electorate is heavily latino? or virginia, where the d.c. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of warren, buttigieg and bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the sanders camp?
biden, in other words, seems to be doing really well in what flannery o'connor dubbed the christ-haunted south. but that's the place where sanders is particularly bad at campaigning. i heard some of his surrogates onstage working stilted religious references into their speeches and looked around at a crowd that clearly wasn't overly familiar with the bible and thought, why are they bothering? they just don't speak fluent church lady and neither does anyone else here.
opinion who could win the democratic primary? use the post opinions simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.
biden, by contrast, speaks easily and naturally of his own faith and connects it with that of his likely voters here. he has been telling a story about how he shared his own suffering at the death of his son with the survivors of dylann roof's horrific attack on the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston. it makes a big impression at the rally i attended on friday night, and illustrates why biden carried voters who regularly attend religious services by more than 40 percentage points while sanders won those who never attend.
the problem is that once you get outside of the south, and particularly in the big states, the democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. if biden runs the tables in the south on tuesday, and sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried california and texas and massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a republican come november?
he moved up through the ranks — assigned to an elite rescue truck, then promoted to battalion chief, and on up to the executive office. he earned the department's highest honor for rescuing an unconscious man trapped in a burning house.
in september, mayor muriel e. bowser (d) announced that the 54-year-old donnelly was her choice to be the district's new chief of the fire and emergency medical services department. donnelly did not predict drastic change, saying at a news conference: our path forward is the path we have been on.
the district's new fire chief is signaling a continuation of policies and plans put in place by his predecessor, gregory m. dean, whom the mayor lured out of retirement from seattle in 2015 to turn around what was then a troubled agency marred by high-profile failures. donnelly was one of the insiders dean turned to for help.
but donnelly — who started fighting fires for a volunteer company in prince george's county when he was 16, and later battled forest and brush fires in remote areas of the west coast — faces some daunting challenges.
he assumes the role in the midst of a global pandemic that has sickened more than 285 d.c. firefighters, including himself, and sidelined many more in quarantine. d.c. leaders warn that his department will not be immune to budget cuts forced by a fall in revenue and expenditures because of covid-19.
there is a crisis in front of us, d.c. council member charles allen (d-ward 6) told donnelly at his brief confirmation hearing in december, which drew just two other lawmakers and the supportive president of the firefighter's union.
you're under incredible stress every day, and throw on top of it the pandemic, said allen, who chairs the committee on the judiciary and public safety.
the last nine months have been really hard, donnelly answered, noting that one of his most important jobs is ensuring that first responders have enough masks and other protective equipment.
emergency calls during the coronavirus pandemic have decreased, he said, corresponding to a decline in the numbers of workers and tourists who can more than double the district's population on a typical workday. but he said first responders falling ill or being forced into quarantine means their colleagues are working harder to fill vacant shifts.
he said paramedics are finding more people dying at home — in many cases not of covid-19. it is a phenomenon seen across the country, partly attributed to people's being afraid to seek treatment at hospitals during the pandemic.
donnelly lives in manor park in northwest washington with his wife, a city schoolteacher. they have a son who is a u.s. army captain serving in kuwait, a daughter studying to be an emergency medical technician in new york city and another son in high school. in his spare time, donnelly volunteers with the boy scouts in the brookland neighborhood of northeast washington.
not only was donnelly among the first of the district's firefighters to contract covid-19, he donated his blood plasma in the search for treatments, and he later was among the first to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.
for him, the tumult brought on by the virus has an upside. relationships built under stress, he said, are the ones that last.
donnelly started his firefighting career while still in high school, at the allentown road volunteer fire company in fort washington, in prince george's county.
still in his teens, he was struck by encountering people of different backgrounds, assembled in one place with a common goal of helping the community.
two years later, he traveled to the west coast, arriving in cedarville, calif., near the border with nevada and oregon — an hour and a half from a traffic light — with fire boots made for service in a city. he had to switch to gear more suitable for hiking as he set off to confront his first forest fire, which was ripping through 30,000 acres outside reno, nev.
donnelly said he was acting like a whiny teenager, and the fire commander threatened to send him home.
boy, did he help me grow up, the chief said. it was a lesson, and i was not going to be a failure.
donnelly returned home a short time later, taking firefighting jobs in prince george's county and later at reagan national airport, before coming to the district in 1992. he helped during the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, commanded the ems response to the mass shooting at the navy yard and at the four-alarm fire that burned the landmark frager's hardware on capitol hill in 2013.
while working for the fire chief who preceded dean, donnelly was called on to help straighten up a department experiencing failures that led to delays in getting help to people in emergencies.
donnelly took on the unglamorous job of managing a fleet, then in disarray, with nearly half the department's firetrucks, engines and ambulances in disrepair or running without safety certificates. firefighters were climbing ladders that had not been inspected, and help was not reaching people fast enough.
donnelly continued helping to improve the department when bowser became mayor and hired dean as chief. the two worked to restore credibility, and at his december confirmation hearing, donnelly told lawmakers that for the first time in five years, every one of our apparatus that are in service are certified.
that means, donnelly said, the vehicles stay in your community so they can help you when you need it.
donnelly carefully answered questions from council member brooke pinto (d-ward 2) about lingering problems with dispatchers at the office of unified communications, a separate d.c. agency also known as the 911 center. firefighters have struggled recently with being sent to wrong addresses, which slows their response to critical emergency calls.
donnelly did not assess blame, and in a later interview, he said there are challenges we both face to get the system working to get the best outcome for all patients. in late december, the mayor's office announced that the director of the 911 center, karima holmes, was leaving for another job, and a national search for her replacement is underway.
the new chief said he plans to build on programs put in place under dean, including hands-on cpr training given to tens of thousands of d.c. residents and workers. the technique is popular because it eliminates mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and emphasizes chest compressions to quickly pump blood to an oxygen-deprived brain. he said the cardiac arrest survival rate has doubled since 2014.
dean and donnelly developed a program in which nurses at the 911 center talk to patients calling in for help, diverting some away from hospitals and cutting back on unnecessary responses by emt teams. next year, donnelly said, he wants to improve treatment for stroke patients and track their progress to determine whether paramedics can adjust their care to improve outcomes.
donnelly has been busy instilling core values that include first-responders thinking on their own.
washington rookie defensive end chase young, who had a sack and a fumble recovery in sunday's win, doesn't seem content with just making the playoffs, where a prime-time showdown with tom brady and the tampa bay buccaneers awaits.
tom brady, i'm coming! young shouted as he skipped off the field. i want tom!
we've got to have a no-hat rule this week, eagles defensive coordinator jim schwartz said last week, explaining the motivation his team had to face washington despite being eliminated from playoff contention. we can't let opponents put division win hats on at the linc. there's a lot of pride in that, and all our focus has to be to accomplishing that this week.
after philadelphia allowed 70 points in its previous two games, schwartz's defense did its best to enforce the rule, but it wasn't enough to prevent washington from donning division champs gear as it headed off the field following an ugly win.
washington's opening possession was, for a change, a thing of beauty. after the defense forced a punt on philadelphia's first drive, alex smith took over at his team's 9-yard line and proceeded to lead the offense 91 yards in 15 plays over the next eight minutes. the march, a mix of runs and passes, culminated in a touchdown grab by wide receiver terry mclaurin.
washington avoided becoming the first nfl team this century to fail to score on its opening possession all season. new orleans's offense didn't account for a first-drive score in 2004, but the saints' aaron stecker returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown in week 15 of that season.
yes, i was coaching to win, pederson, philadelphia's coach, said of his decision to bench rookie quarterback jalen hurts for nate sudfeld, a sixth-round pick by washington in the 2016 draft, with the eagles trailing 17-14 in the fourth quarter. nate has obviously been here for four years, and i felt that he deserved an opportunity to get some snaps.
sudfeld leading a comeback to keep his former team out of the playoffs would've been rich, but it was not to be. on his third snap, he was intercepted by former eagles safety jeremy reaves. on his next series, he fumbled a snap that was recovered by young. he looked like someone who hadn't thrown a pass in a game since 2018.
what was your reaction when philadelphia put sundberg in? nbc sideline reporter michele tafoya asked smith after the game, before correcting her mispronunciation of sudfeld's name.
i didn't know if something had happened, smith said. i didn't know if [hurts] tweaked something. i didn't know if was because the rain kind of picked up at that point. i don't know if that had anything to do with it.
nope. it was simply a coaching decision, which led to all sorts of criticism of pederson for sabotaging his team's chances of winning the game.
washington's struggles in prime time are well documented, but playing under the lights in the city of brotherly love has been an exception in recent years. for the second time in five seasons, washington clinched an nfc east title with a prime-time win at lincoln financial field. in 2015, kirk cousins led washington to a 38-24 win the day after christmas in week 16. this year, it happened in the final game of the regular season. it's just a shame there weren't any eagles fans in the stands to witness it.
giants players and fans were none too pleased with pederson's personnel moves, as they needed a philadelphia upset to claim the division title after knocking off the dallas cowboys earlier in the day. considering the giants would have become the first six-win team to qualify for the playoffs in a full season, it's hard to feel too much sympathy for their plight.
mclaurin returned from a high-ankle sprain that sidelined him last week and had a game-high seven catches for 40 yards, including washington's first touchdown. mclaurin said he felt a little sore and banged up as the game wore on, but his feelings didn't appear to be hurt too bad late in the first half when tight end logan thomas left him hanging after his own leaping touchdown grab. while thomas focused on spiking the ball, mclaurin borrowed a page from capitals forward evgeny kuznetsov's playbook and celebrated with himself.
in the letter, released monday, marine corps brig. gen. william h. seely iii said that u.s. forces respect your sovereign decision to order our departure. a u.s. military official confirmed the letter's authenticity.
but on a day of confusion, esper said he could not confirm the authenticity of the letter because he had seen it only after it was leaked, adding that it is inconsistent with where we are right now.
gen. mark a. milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the letter incorrectly implies withdrawal and was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.
asked whether the u.s. military was prepared to strike iranian cultural sites, as president trump has suggested, esper said the military would follow the laws of armed conflict.
esper said that the united states remains prepared for any contingency with regard to iran and that the message to tehran is that the ball remains in their court.
here are key points of what we know:
●the u.s. military said in a letter to iraqi officials that it will reposition troops within iraq in preparation for a possible withdrawal, but defense secretary mark t. esper said shortly after that the united states has not made any decision to leave iraq.
●gen. mark a. milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the letter was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.
●lawmakers are expected to be briefed by top u.s. officials on the strike that killed soleimani, according to three people familiar with the plans.
●the pentagon has told the bataan amphibious ready group to be ready to support middle east operations, a defense official said.
●the funeral in tehran for soleimani was a stark display of his importance to the regime.
●in the aftermath of the strike that killed soleimani, iran has discarded more internationally mandated curbs on its nuclear program.
link copied link defense minister says no decision on pulling canadian troops from iraq, calls situation 'complex' toronto — canadian defense minister harjit sajjan said monday that no decision has been made to pull canadian troops from iraq and stressed the need for de-escalation in the region. in a television interview with the canadian broadcasting corp., sajjan said that the iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. we know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. canada has hundreds of military personnel in iraq as part of both the nato mission and the global coalition fighting the islamic state. it has suspended both of those missions, but sajjan said he hopes they will continue. he told the cbc that canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of soleimani's killing. asked if u.s. officials had given canada notice of their plan to kill the iranian general, sajjan said that canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. in a television interview on monday with ctv news, sajjan condemned iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought soleimani's killing was legal.
prime minister justin trudeau tweeted on monday that he met with sajjan and jonathan vance, the chief of the defense staff, in the morning. he said the safety of canadians in the region is his top priority. ad ad

link copied link in response to trump threat, iran's president invokes 1988 tragedy many americans have forgotten washington — on saturday, trump invoked history when tweeting out a threat to destroy 52 iranian sites … some at a very high level & important to iran & the iranian culture. he said the potential targets represent the 52 americans who were held hostage there for 444 days from 1979 to 1981. on monday, iranian president hassan rouhani also invoked history in response to trump's threat. those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #ir655 never threaten the iranian nation, he wrote. his hashtag #ir655 refers to iran air flight 655, a commercial jet shot down by the u.s. military by mistake july 3, 1988, killing all 290 civilians and crew on board, including 66 children. though the incident is nearly forgotten now in the united states, it is etched deeply in memory in iran, where the country is mourning the u.s. airstrike that killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani. ad ad
link copied link u.s. general calls letter to iraqis an honest mistake washington — after the u.s. military's letter describing plans to reposition troops within iraq in preparation for a possible withdrawal leaked, milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, called gen. kenneth f. mckenzie jr., the commander of u.s. central command, which oversees the middle east. mckenzie told him the draft letter was an honest mistake, but used other words that were a little more colorful than mistake, milley said. the u.s. military drafted the letter because it is moving forces around the region, within iraq and from kuwait into iraq, and anticipates increased helicopter movement, milley said, noting that draft letters are often coordinated with partners in advance, but are circulated without the signature of the official sending the communication. the leaked letter wasn't signed. milley said that mckenzie, the top u.s. commander overseeing the middle east, said the letter should never have happened. we understand u.s. government policy — nobody is leaving, there's no onward movement, we got all that. honest mistake. draft, milley said mckenzie told him. ad ad

link copied link pentagon tells force of 4,500 sailors and marines to be ready to support middle east operations if necessary washington — the pentagon has told the bataan amphibious ready group, a force of about 4,500 sailors and marines aboard navy ships, to be ready to support operations in the middle east if required, a defense official said monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. the official declined to specify the location of the group, led by the amphibious assault ship uss bataan. a second official said friday that the ships were approaching the mediterranean sea and could be called upon if needed. the decision could bolster the number of u.s. troops in the region by about 10,000, as the trump administration and iranian officials threaten each other following numerous attacks on u.s. troops in iraq and the u.s. killing of soleimani in a drone strike in baghdad last week. those troop increases come on top of the pentagon's deployment of an additional 14,000 troops to the middle east in 2019, citing the need to counter iranian aggression.
link copied link e.u. foreign ministers to hold emergency meeting friday to respond to iran crisis brussels — european union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on friday in brussels to discuss how to respond to the escalating crisis with iran, diplomats said monday, including whether europe starts the process that could lead to the eventual reimposition of sanctions on iran. the unusual gathering will give europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the united states for soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. but they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 iran nuclear deal following trump's pullout. many european diplomats view soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in november of a u.s. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than trump. iran on sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. europeans took that as a sign that tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations.
if sanctions were reimposed, that would likely mark the end of any effort by iran to uphold the deal.
but weeks after the harrises' triumphant european tour, the white house unleashed a trade war with the european union by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. the e.u. retaliated with tariffs that made some american goods, including bourbon and rye whiskey, more expensive to import.
catoctin creek's orders from europe dried up, and a potential british distributor lost interest. he ghosted us like a bad girlfriend, scott harris said from the distillery's red-brick tasting room as a pair of shiny stills chugged away behind a plate-glass window. he just stopped answering the phone.
washington's trade dispute with europe may have faded from the headlines in recent months, eclipsed by grander tensions with china, but the fallout continues for many companies around the country that have long targeted europe as an achievable export market.
barriers to europe are especially vexing for small businesses, which often turn to the e.u. as their first export destination. the reliability of the legal system, the prevalence of english speakers and the high level of consumer income make it an easier market for small u.s. firms to navigate, entrepreneurs say.
the e.u.'s 25 percent tariffs have crimped the sales growth of a variety of u.s. exporters, including apparel companies, boat builders and peanut butter makers. lee zalben, founder of peanut butter & co., a 15-person firm in manhattan, said european buyers are canceling or trimming orders, or asking for discounts.
exports to the european union make up less than 2 percent of the firm's revenue, but the company had been targeting europe for sales growth, so we're having to find that growth in other areas, zalben said.
catoctin creek had been aiming to boost european exports from about 10­ percent of its sales in early 2018 to as much as 25 percent to take advantage of the hip profile american whiskey has developed overseas. instead, exports have fallen to close to zero.
it's essentially decimated our european business, and it's put our expansion on hold, said scott harris, who has instituted a hiring freeze and put off buying new stills and fermentation tanks at the 20-person distillery on purcellville's main street.
european officials are due to visit washington next week to continue talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute.
the office of the u.s. trade representative didn't respond to a request for comment.
becky harris, the chief distiller, said the slowdown also affects the company's suppliers. one of our [rye] farmers keeps asking when are we going to need more? she said.
rivals are similarly discouraged. we've spent a lot of time and money to build up our business [in europe], and to have it taken away with tariffs is frustrating, said paul hletko, founder of few spirits, a gin and whiskey distillery in evanston, ill., that employs about 100 people. the company's export volume fell by about 75 percent last year.
cleveland whiskey, an ohio distiller with 15 employees, has lost about $150,000 in european revenue and has scrapped plans to hire two additional workers, said founder tom lix. he expressed frustration with what he sees as a self-inflicted wound. we started this, so i can't really blame [europe], he said. we started this, and everything else was retaliatory.
exports have become crucial in the whiskey business as the u.s. market grows crowded with craft distillers. when the harrises co-founded catoctin creek in 2010, there were six distilleries in virginia. today there are 70 — and more than a thousand nationwide.
the boom has revived an industry that dates back to america's earliest english settlers, who made whiskey on the banks of virginia's james river. george washington eventually became one of the country's biggest distillers, producing more than 10,000 gallons of whiskey at mount vernon a year.
whiskey production withered in some parts of the country during prohibition; when catoctin creek opened for business, it was the first legal distillery in loudoun county since the 1920s.
scott harris, an engineer by training, had spent 20 years working in government contracting and wanted a change of pace. becky harris, a chemical engineer, was the brains behind the distilling process. if there is a fruit, vegetable, tuber with starch or sugar in it, you can bet that becky will try to distill it, the company's website says.
the couple got a $250,000 small-business loan and renovated a former buick dealership from the 1920s.
on a recent morning, a handful of employees filled and labeled bottles for shipping as a new batch of rye mash fermented in a large tank, filling the room with a sweet aroma.
later, the mixture will be pumped into a pair of german-made stills that will boil it and turn the alcohol into vapor, which will revert to liquid as it cools.
catoctin creek did well in the u.s. market, but as competition grew, it found u.s. distributors weren't as interested in new products, harris said.
about five years ago, the distillery decided it wanted to crack europe. it started investing in new bottles and labels that met e.u. standards, hired a european consultant, and began attending an annual trade show in berlin.
catoctin creek eventually found distributors in germany and italy, which helped get the company's whiskey into some high-end cocktail bars, harris said.
all told, the company has spent about $100,000 on the effort, he said.
early last year, the harrises traveled to britain to meet with a potential distributor and to market their whiskey to top hotel bars. they poured samples for buyers at london's famous savoy and claridge's hotels and struck a tentative agreement with a distributor in manchester, harris said.
two weeks after they returned to the united states, the white house announced plans to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the e.u. and elsewhere, calling the imports a threat to domestic production.
president trump announced on july 25 that the u.s. would work with the european union to eliminate trade tariffs. (reuters)
the e.u. soon threatened, and then enacted, retaliatory tariffs on a host of u.s. goods. europe pointedly included products made in the home states of congressional republican leaders paul d. ryan (wis.) and mitch mcconnell (ky.), including motorcycles and whiskey, but the tariffs applied to producers nationwide.
in july, president trump and european commission president jean-claude juncker declared a truce in the trade war, promising to delay additional tariffs and to start negotiations toward a new trade deal. but they didn't roll back the tariffs levied earlier.
when it comes to the afc east quarterback landscape, what a difference a year makes. at the end of the 2019 regular season, the new england patriots had tom brady, the new york jets were coming off a string of wins with sam darnold, the miami dolphins were assured of a top-five pick in the draft and a shot at a highly regarded prospect, and the buffalo bills still had question marks about the talented but very inconsistent josh allen.
now, having submitted a stunning campaign that put him on the fringes of the nfl mvp conversation, allen is just about the only sure thing in the division.
the patriots lost brady in free agency and added cam newton late in last year's offseason, but after a promising start the 10th-year veteran showed why other teams were leery of taking a chance on him, while young backup jarrett stidham appeared to lose the confidence of coach bill belichick. the jets suffered through a miserable season that has landed them the no. 2 overall pick, and although it's not clear that they will part ways with darnold, the former no. 3 pick in 2018 did nothing to help his cause with arguably his worst season in the nfl.
the dolphins might be the most fascinating situation, because it's only recently become a fair question as to whether they might want to move on from tua tagovailoa. the former alabama star, on whom they spent the fifth overall pick in 2020, did not exactly light up the league in nine starts this season, especially as compared to los angeles chargers quarterback justin herbert, who went one pick after him in the draft.
tagovailoa was careful almost to a fault, throwing just two interceptions in his first eight starts but averaging a subpar 6.3 yards per attempt as he generally eschewed shots downfield. twice he was replaced late in games by veteran backup ryan fitzpatrick, but with the latter unavailable on sunday, it was up to tagovailoa to play well enough in buffalo to ensure his team a playoff berth with a win. instead, he played poorly, throwing three interceptions before connecting on a touchdown pass well after the outcome was decided in the bills' favor. if miami gets the no. 3 pick in this year's draft, which would convey from the houston texans after a 2019 trade, it might have quite a dilemma on its hands.
but some people close to the operation have grown worried that biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. some who once saw biden as the strongest potential challenger to president trump are looking at others, including billionaire mike bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on super tuesday.
black voters in south carolina really like joe biden, trust joe biden and respect joe biden, said steve benjamin, the mayor of columbia and a bloomberg supporter. but they are pragmatic and want to win and beat trump. if your number one argument is electability, and you can't crack the top four in two or three states in a row, that's a tough argument to make.
biden's biggest challenge in the state has come from billionaire tom steyer, who is also betting his campaign on a strong showing here. while biden has been trying — and failing — elsewhere, steyer has been blanketing south carolina with ads and organization.
asked whether biden's campaign is in trouble, dick harpootlian, a longtime biden friend and fundraiser, paused for two seconds and leaned back in his chair before saying no. biden had 30 years of experience in south carolina and could remind voters how many times he'd been in the state, how much he cared about middle-class people and his role backing president barack obama, harpootlian said.
i don't think it's in trouble. but i do think they have to apply the resources and focus on south carolina if they're going to have the kind of win that sends a message, he said. they need to send more resources here to get the message out.
biden, addressing supporters here tuesday night as new hampshire results showed him running near the bottom of the field, portrayed south carolina as friendlier political terrain for him — and more representative of the party.
up until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency of the democratic party, the african american community, he said.
this account of biden's increasingly important campaign in south carolina is based on interviews with 39 party and campaign officials, activists, voters, political strategists and longtime political observers in the state, many of whom say biden is underperforming.
his path to a potential resurrection here is further complicated by his surging rivals — bernie sanders and pete buttigieg — who want to show in south carolina that they can broaden their support beyond heavily white constituencies.
and the impact south carolina may have on the broader race remains unclear. biden can ill afford another defeat in the feb. 22 nevada caucuses, which take place one week before the primary here, and the outcome here will be quickly swamped by super tuesday on march 3, when states including california, texas and virginia hold their primaries.
biden has visited south carolina eight times thus far, but aides say they expect a near-universal focus on the palmetto state in upcoming weeks before the primary vote after his last-minute decision to speak there tuesday night. the primary is heavily, though not entirely, african american and largely focused on the state's bigger cities, such as columbia, orangeburg, charleston and greenville.
the south carolina primary will be one of the first contests in this process in which communities of color will have the opportunity to make their voices heard, said biden senior adviser symone sanders, and our campaign has significantly increased its investments here, including with expanded television and radio ad buys covering the vast majority of the state's population.
on multiple fronts, biden seems behind. he has 43 aides in south carolina, a campaign spokeswoman said, while steyer has 93, and sanders has 72.
steyer has spent more than $14 million on radio and television commercials in south carolina. biden recently went on the air for the first time last week, campaign and party officials say.
we've seen more mail from steyer than any candidate, times three, said benjamin, echoing a sentiment from others in the state. others said they had received so much mail and watched so many steyer ads that it is a joke in their households that you cannot escape him.
try to watch an rem video on youtube without seeing him, said phil bailey, a prominent democratic consultant. you can't do it.
david bryant, a retired social worker from new york who lives in columbia, said he was deciding between steyer — whose name he at first struggled to recall — and sanders. he said he liked biden but had not seen a commercial from him or heard anything from his campaign, and he thought biden, 77, lacked the vigor that some of the other candidates had.
if i thought he really wanted it, he'd be my first choice, bryant said as he drove around five points, a bar district popular with college students. biden don't seem to want it bad enough. he doesn't seem like he really wanted it.
while serving ham biscuits and cheddar grits to churchgoers at lizard's thicket on sunday, joann prince recounted calling biden's campaign office to volunteer. but no one called me back, she said.
eventually, prince said she went to the campaign office, where she was assigned to door-knock in a poorer part of columbia. prince, who is in her 70s, went alone, with a script to remind black voters that biden was obama's vice president. hardly anyone was home, she said, and most yards had signs warning of dogs.
it was a disaster, she said.
prince said she still likes biden, but after dealing with his campaign, she is considering other candidates. i'm on the fence, she said.
there were few signs for biden in yards around columbia, and a recent visit to the columbia field office gave no indication of bustle.
some party officials, lawmakers and strategists in columbia say they have received little contact from biden's campaign.
carol fowler, a national democratic committeewoman, said she had not received a call from biden or his campaign asking for her support — though other candidates have called her. some activists complained after biden came to abbeville to file his papers but did not meet with them.
if i do endorse, it will probably be someone who has called and asked me, she said, adding that biden was still the favorite in south carolina but seemed to be fading. a lot of undecided voters are just looking for someone who can beat trump, and they are maybe looking to new hampshire and other states more than in previous years.
campaign officials and some biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing obama as his vice president. benjamin, the columbia mayor backing bloomberg, and others lauded kendall corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in south carolina. biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. his aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where biden necessarily does well.
state sen. marlon kimpson, one of biden's most prominent backers, was dismissive of steyer's money and the notion that biden's campaign is eroding. even ronald mcdonald can move the needle with a billion dollars, he said.
he added: i think people are frustrated that [iowa and new hampshire], the first state that couldn't even get the results counted, and the second, a very small state, are setting the narrative. neither is representative of the electorate. we have to let the race play out.
on a recent evening in orangeburg, more than 500 people showed up to see biden, eclipsing a similar steyer event. bernice scott, a fierce biden supporter who organizes door-knocking with 35 other women wearing shirts labeled the reckoning crew, said many black voters in south carolina are not won over by steyer or others.
everybody i talk to, they say, we know him, oh yeah, i'm supporting him, said scott, a councilwoman and local activist.
but the steyer campaign has worried advisers like amanda alpert loveday, who runs biden's super pac in south carolina and said steyer's huge push into the state hurts because it eats into the margin.
activists and party officials say steyer has visited south carolina more than a dozen times, taking advantage of his foes focusing on other states.
volunteers for the biden campaign have been instructed to tell potential supporters that steyer is a good democrat but lacks experience.
others close to biden have taken a more aggressive tack in criticizing steyer, accusing him of paying supporters for their endorsements. scott said she found it insulting that candidates like steyer are spending so much money in the state when they have no history there. i can't be bought, and i won't be sold, she said.
harpootlian, biden's longtime friend and golf buddy, recently accused jerry govan, a state lawmaker, of endorsing steyer only because he was paid $43,000 by the campaign. filings show that govan was paid that sum for consulting.
steyer demanded an apology from biden during friday night's debate, which biden did not give, and govan called the charge that he was backing steyer for money offensive.
harpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. i'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about biden's comments during the friday debate that harpootlian was sorry. if they want to get in the weeds, i'm happy to get in the weeds with them.
meanwhile, sanders has taken a different approach. michael wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in myrtle beach, a medicare-for-all breakfast in florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from columbia.
more and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, wukela said. people are tired of the status quo.
on a recent monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the sanders headquarters. a sign on the wall said the bernie 2020 wish list included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and gatorade. the only item with a check mark was a microwave. the room looked like a college democrats meeting.
sipping a bud light on the back deck at the salty nut cafe in downtown columbia on monday afternoon, loveday, who leads the biden super pac, seemed largely untroubled. he could beat trump. he could win south carolina. voters are too conservative to go for sanders or other liberal candidates, said loveday, who also works for a consulting firm.
but as she told stories of biden taking photos as he held a fundraiser at her family's charleston house, and being so distraught when he bowed out in 2016 that her mother sent her flowers, she conceded that it would probably be a dogfight.
democrats kick off their presidential primaries and caucuses with february contests in four states. these states are small, contributing just 155 pledged delegates out of the democratic total of 3,979, but they have an outsized role in the narratives that can determine the eventual nominee.
tue., feb 11 sat., feb 22 new hampshire primary nevada caucuses mon., feb 3 iowa caucuses sat., feb 29 south carolina primary tue., feb 11 new hampshire primary sat., feb 22 mon., feb 3 nevada caucuses iowa caucuses sat., feb 29 south carolina primary
in 2008, barack obama broke out of the pack with a surprisingly decisive iowa win, putting him in a front-runner position he never relinquished. in 2016, hillary clinton countered a major victory by bernie sanders in new hampshire with wins in nevada and south carolina, establishing a lead among nonwhite voters that guided her to eventual victory.
[which of these 2020 democrats agrees with you most?]
none of the four states fully reflect america, and the least representative two go first. taken together, though, the unique qualities of each mean several key blocs of voters get at least one opportunity to have an outsized role in the early nomination process.
the nomination starts rural, but then gets more urban
large metro areas >1m other metros <1m small town rural iowa sioux city cedar rapids des moines new hampshire manchester nevada reno las vegas south carolina greenville columbia charleston large metro areas >1m other metros <1m small town rural iowa new hampshire nevada south carolina greenville sioux city reno columbia cedar rapids des moines charleston las vegas manchester large metro areas >1m other metros <1m small town rural iowa new hampshire nevada south carolina greenville sioux city reno columbia cedar rapids des moines charleston las vegas manchester
more than half of americans live in a large metropolitan area of more than a million people. but none of the february primary states fall near that average. just one in 16 americans lives in a rural county, and yet the nomination process begins in one of the most rural states in the nation. in fact, each of the four early states overrepresents a different kind of community.
united states population small town 8% 6 metro 30% large metro areas 56% rural iowa 59% 16% 25% new hampshire 32% 31% 34% 4 nevada 73% 17% 8% south carolina 8% 77% 9% 6 population distribution by counties
if iowa gives rural voters a chance to be heard, new hampshire is all about small towns; areas with towns of over 10,000 account for about a third of the state's population.
[iowa is a myth. should we believe in it?]
nevada falls at the other extreme: it is one of the most urbanized populations in the united states. the state's wide-open spaces are mostly empty of people, and three quarters of the state's population is packed into las vegas. south carolina is uniquely urbanized in a different way. with no giant metro, south carolina leads the nation with people in suburbs and smaller cities.
the last two have some diversity, but iowa and new hampshire do not

minorities have little representation in the first two contests. states do not get much more heavily white than iowa, with caucuses on feb. 3 , and new hampshire, which follows with a primary on feb. 11.
united states population black other white 61% 18% 12% hispanic asian iowa 86% 6 3 new hampshire 90% 4 nevada 50% 29% 9% 8% south carolina 64% 6 27%
more diversity enters the picture on feb. 22 with the nevada caucuses. nevada has one of the highest concentrations of hispanics in the nation, and south carolina follows on feb. 29 as one of the states with the highest share of african americans. nevada is one of the least white states in the country. while south carolina still has roughly the same white population as the united states overall, the strong democratic lean of its black voters means the primary is much more nonwhite than the state.
the position of the last two states in the february primary calendar is recent history. the democratic party moved them up for the 2008 election to offset the lack of diversity of new hampshire and iowa, and to represent more regions of the united states. in a democratic national committee vote, nevada was selected over arizona, and south carolina was chosen over alabama.
older adults, always among the most regular voters, play an oversized role in the earliest contests. over a third of registered democrats in iowa and new hampshire are age 65 or older, well above the u.s. average.
jobs in goods industries median household income registered democrats college education < 25 years old 65+ 9% 26% 32% $60k 19% us ia 7 34 25 28 59k nh 38 2 20 37 74k nv 9 26 13 24 58k sc 24 51k 9 21 27 jobs in goods industries median household income registered democrats college education < 25 years old 65+ 32% 9% 26% 19% $60k united states iowa 7% 34% 25% 28% $59k new hampshire 38% 2% 20% 37% $74k nevada 26% $58k 9% 13% 24% south carolina 9% 24% 21% 27% $51k
workers in goods-producing industries like manufacturing and agriculture are also quite common in the early states, especially in iowa and south carolina. they may provide an insight into who could do well among blue-collar voters in key midwestern swing states. but nevada ranks near the bottom on workers who make or grow products. service workers, who make up a lion's share of the national economy but get less attention politically — are the stars in nevada, where las vegas union members are a critical voting block.
so who may be underrepresented in february? with the exception of new hampshire, the residents of the early states have disproportionately lower income and levels of education. none of the states rank high in young registered democrats, and workers in non-goods industries like technology or trade get short shrift as well.

(randall hill/reuters)
more than 12 million americans live in these first four states. but the number of eligible voters is smaller, and the number that actually participates in the democratic nominating process is smaller still.
in 2016, only about 900,000 americans were part of these democratic primaries and caucuses, placing critical decisions in the hands of about as many people as live in columbus, ohio.
fewer democrats participated in primaries than voted for clinton in 2016 each circle represents 10,000 votes primary/caucus votes clinton votes iowa 172,000 654,000 new hampshire 251,000 349,000 nevada 84,000 539,000 south carolina 369,000 855,000 4 early states combined 876,000 2,397,000 fewer democrats participated in primaries than voted for clinton in 2016 each circle represents 10,000 votes primary/caucus votes clinton votes 172,000 654,000 iowa 251,000 349,000 new hampshire 84,000 539,000 nevada 369,000 855,000 south carolina 4 early states combined 876,000 2,397,000
why the big differences in turnout between the states? iowa and nevada hold caucuses, a time-intensive and extremely public method of voting that can drive people away. the iowa and nevada caucuses are both closed, but both do allow for same-day registration (with nevada making the switch in 2019).
new hampshire and south carolina hold primaries instead. those primaries are also open, meaning you do not need to be a registered democrat to participate.
[how do the iowa caucuses work, and how are they different this year?]
in 2016, these early states made up just 3 percent democratic primary voters. yet their early influence far exceeded those numbers. in 2020 they set the stage for the march 3 super tuesday primaries, when 14 states with about 26 million democratic registered voters will have their say.
where the race stands in the next two primary and caucus states
the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary are now over, if not conclusive. so candidates are moving on to the next two early states.
about this story: this story is based on population demographics from the american community survey, voter registration data from l2 and election results from the associated press and the elections project.
dear amy: my boyfriend and i (we're gay) recently decided to get married, but my fiance and various family members suggest that we exclude my 92-year-old grandmother from the wedding.
my grandmother regularly shocks people. she says offensive and hurtful comments to everyone to elicit a reaction, regardless of the setting or situation.
she loves to call people fat or dumb, uses female pronouns for my fiance and me, and (our favorite) -- lights cigarettes indoors or in restaurants.
she's very with it and according to her doctors, exhibits no signs of senility. she was a soap opera actress in the '50s and '60s, so we think she just enjoys the attention.
my parents have talked to her about her behavior, and nothing has changed. my mother asked that we invite her.
i called my grandmother and told her that i want to invite her to the wedding, but that i'm worried about her upsetting other guests. she laughed, and told me, that's just who i am; can't change now, and made it clear that she expects to be invited.
future groom: your blowhard granny has thrown down the gauntlet by declaring her intention to offend others. if you definitely don't want her there, then don't invite her (her insults toward you and your fiance are reason enough to exclude her), but if including her is important to your mother, then you should consider it.
you might be able to marginalize granny enough that you can reduce her from being the offensive center-of-attention, to the rude, eccentric elderly lady who keeps trying to smoke at the reception hall.
let her know that you actually do expect her to behave differently than usual while at your wedding. don't hand her a microphone during the speechmaking. ask a family member or caregiver to take her home if she becomes disruptive.
dear amy: i think i might be dating a liar. we've been together for three months. i am 28 and he is 34. i don't have any evidence to suggest that he has lied specifically to me, but i have seen him lie to other people.
he lies to his ex (with whom he has two children) in front of me. she will call and he will deliberately lie about something to get her off the phone. these are little lies, such as that he has something he needs to take care of. he will also call in to work with lies and excuses to get out of shifts.
i am conflicted about this because the lies seem small. however, i don't understand why he feels the need to lie at all when the truth would suffice.
it is at the point where if he is late to dinner because work went late, i wonder if he is lying to me the same way i have seen him lie to others. additionally, because he has lied to his ex about me, i wonder if he is seeing other women and is also lying about that.
i don't really know if i am making something out of nothing. i am worried that if i bring it up to him he will just deny it and then try to be sneakier about it in the future.
worried: your boyfriend reflexively lies when telling the truth is awkward or inconvenient. you can assume that his behavior extends to you, as well.
i can almost understand inventing an excuse to get off the phone with an ex-spouse (he needs to take these calls because they have children, but he doesn't need to stay on the call if it isn't important). lying to get out of a work shift, however, is another story. at 34 years old, he should be able to commit to working when he is supposed to.
if you are determined to take your relationship to another level, you should be able to discuss almost anything with him, including this, without fear that the discussion would make his behavior worse.
dear amy: your response to outmuscled was so sexist. his girlfriend was stronger than he and regularly challenged and beat him in arm wrestling. why didn't you tell him to leave this abusive relationship?
dismayed: i pointed out that if outmuscled was a woman, i would definitely tell him to leave. i agree with your implication that this behavior is abusive. if she won't stop outmuscling him, he should definitely leave.

If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction, Mulvaney said.
There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote in her resignation letter to Trump.
— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.
Critics said she failed to protect students' civil rights. Speed is not the measure of whether justice is served, said Liz King, senior director of the education equity program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

Although democracy protests and anti-government protests do not spread to other countries in general, their symbols, strategies and tactics can. By wearing yellow vests, activists outside France have been able to make their protests appear to be part of a larger movement, attracting more international and domestic media attention. The Egyptian government's decision to ban yellow vests may not be absurd after all.
Should Egypt's government and other governments worry about France's yellow vest protests triggering similar protests in their countries?

When we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words, Sanders said. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.

The effect of all that is to present Harris as a perfect fit for the Democrats of 2020, one who was early and right about much of what the party's base cares about, and who was in the mix opposing Trump on everything that mattered. The book and the tour, which has been dominated by friendly, encouraging interviews, offer less clarity about how Harris can navigate two incredibly different electoral constituencies.
By ceasing the collection and reporting of substantial amounts of civil judgment and tax lien information, the three major national credit bureaus will be providing a significantly less valuable product at lower cost (and risk) to themselves while keeping the price of their product unchanged. And this was achieved under the cover of a legal settlement with 31 state attorneys general.

As commentators have said, Republicans deserve the blame for what is happening to America's institutions. They may suffer some of the fallout, too. If Republicans stop recognizing results that they don't like, there is nothing to prevent Democrats from doing the same, tit-for-tat. Seven Republicans in the House of Representatives have warned that efforts to overturn the 2020 vote might erode the advantage that the electoral college gives to their party. GOP candidates need the college, since they have won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years.
She branded it education freedom and suggested federal dollars to support traditional schools had been wasted. When the pandemic hit, DeVos saw the failure of some schools to open doors as evidence that parents needed taxpayer-supported alternatives.
Whatever one may make of the proposal, it was not aimed at Social Security specifically but was part of an effort to reduce the budget deficit. The Washington Post reported the dramatic simplicity of the plan was its fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan's military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.

Egypt's decision was probably fueled by memories of the so-called Arab Spring, when Tunisia's massive anti-government protests spread to similar protests in 10 other countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010. In Egypt, the protesters forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak after almost 30 years in power.
2. Biden's campaign message will go viral as soon as Joe decides what it is.
The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.

Biden certainly could be challenged on why he took these positions at the time, but the snippets cited by Sanders are missing important context.
Local jurisdictions will be rewarded for shoddy record-keeping by enabling more of their highly problematic borrowers and renters to enter the general lending and rental pools — borrowers and renters who are 5½ times more likely to default than those without tax lien or civil judgment problems. In response, lenders will have to increase mortgage interest rates they charge to all borrowers and landlords will have to increase rental rates they charge to renters to offset the increased risk they have been required to bear.

The Dow has lost more than 8,000 points since then.
For presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events. Agents from a local field office who are preparing for a candidate visit require the management of the venue hosting the visit — whether it is a hotel, a convention center or a golf club — to provide, several days before, the names of all employees who will prepare food, entertain or wait on the candidate.
Whether it's big New York City zoning deals — which, by the way, are probably tougher than most of the things I'll be dealing with foreign countries, he continued. I mean, I built a city on the West Side of Manhattan. You talk about getting zoning. Getting zoned for Trump Tower: 68 stories on 57th and 5th. Let me tell you, I've been dealing with politicians all my life. They're fine. They're wonderful. They're all talk, they're no action. They're selling this country down the tubes, and they're easy to deal with. Believe me.
This is an extraordinarily big, complicated task, said Hartle, of the American Council on Education, which opposed the rule. He expects the Biden administration to roll it back but said that will not be quick or easy, partly because the regulation is complex and has many elements. You can't do this by fiat. You have to go through a regulatory process.
Fast forward 10 years to another budget fight. Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. Biden did make a floor speech on Jan. 31, 1995, which referenced his 1984 effort to freeze all spending.
The long and short of 'shrift'
All those uncashed checks were enclosed in a Dec. 12 letter sent to Hutchins' attorney, according to the complaint. The letter informed Hutchins that his partial payments had been rejected, the lawsuit alleges, and that ATS was initiating a foreclosure proceeding against the restaurant at 1100 Florida Ave. NW. The trustee's auction of the property is scheduled for Jan. 18 unless a D.C. Superior Court judge agrees to the temporary restraining order on Thursday.
To protect Social Security, Biden said he would bring both parties to the table to keep the plan paying out. That would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age and raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax past the $97,500 it was in 2007. 'It ain't broke — it doesn't need privatization,' he said of Social Security. 'There's other ways to help savings.'
The budget includes an additional $4 million for the new publicly funded campaign-finance system that will debut in 2018. Leggett said in an interview Monday that he views the legislation creating the system as poorly drafted and included the money grudgingly.He said his main concern is that there is uncertainty over how much the system, which had already been slated for $6 million in funding, will actually cost.
In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced four new cases: a woman in her 70s who tested positive in Anne Arundel County after having close contact with someone else who had the virus; a Montgomery County man in his 20s who recently traveled to Spain; a Baltimore County man in his 60s who was at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in the District; and a Prince George's County man in his 60s, who is currently hospitalized. That man's travel is being investigated.
We have person-to-person transmission occurring in the District of Columbia, as well as at least two individuals whose reasons for covid-19 have yet to be identified, D.C. Health Director LaQuandra S. Nesbitt said at the news conference where Bowser announced the state of emergency.
[Va. high court invalidates McAuliffe's order restoring felon voting rights]
There is no good time to handle problems like these, but this is a particularly important month for Sanders. On Saturday, hundreds of house parties will be organized by supporters who want him to run for president again. By the end of January, at least three co-sponsors of Sanders's major legislation — Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — are expected to be running. Sanders's supporters, in general, have praised his commitment to running a more diverse and sensitive campaign, if he runs again.
When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.
More colleges and schools announced plans to close for deep cleaning or move to online classes.
The bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.

DeVos was a stalwart ally to Trump, even as White House aides whispered that the president did not think much of her. She rarely said anything that could be read as criticism of Trump until Thursday, when she resigned with 13 days remaining, to protest his role in igniting a mob that breached the U.S. Capitol.
Rev. Timothy Cole, 59, the church rector, was diagnosed with the virus after attending an Episcopal leaders conference in Louisville. Organizers of the conference said Wednesday that two other conference attendees have also tested positive.
Northam said steps were being taken in several agencies — including schools, transportation and health — to make sure the commonwealth is prepared to deal with the virus. He has not yet declared a state of emergency but said he is prepared to do so.
Those figures came to light this week in the U.S. Soccer Federation's latest tax form. They illustrate a significant, if narrowing, pay gap between the head coaches of senior national teams with differing levels of success.
According to records on the committee's website, the last time the appropriations panel was without someone from the Old Dominion was 1915, when Woodrow Wilson was president and a quart of milk cost 9 cents.
It is never too soon to try to get rid of Donald Trump, said Shannon Kennedy, a 48-year-old Iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size American flag at the Orpheum Theatre. There is an urgency to get things back on track. Our country is a laughingstock right now.
Bruce Arena collected $1.275 million ($900,000 base salary) for 9½ months of work in 2017 before stepping down after the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He received a $300,000 settlement.
— Not all agencies have halted work. While many federal scientists across the country have been affected by stalled funding and the inability to continue research, the New York Times's Alan Blinder points out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation.
Milhoan said the agency does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program. She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.
Although reading the news made me want to cry more often than not this year, The Post did an excellent job presenting the stories that needed to be shared.
Now that we have closed the door on 2020, I thank The Post for being a bright spot in a terrible year. From Eli Saslow's heartbreaking Voices From the Pandemic to Michelle Singletary's eye-opening series on systemic racism to Robin Givhan's insightful commentary, it was outstanding journalism across the board. I also appreciated the addition of Kate Cohen's voice to the op-ed page.
Democracy is built upon the notion that politicians who lose elections will admit defeat and move on. By challenging this idea — however insincerely — Hawley and Cruz are helping unravel the core political bargains of American politics. Senators with presidential ambitions cannot treat fundamental beliefs about democracy as something they can put on and take off like a costume, returning to real life when the curtain drops. If they act as though they don't hold a core democratic belief, they may convince the audience to stop believing, too. Wednesday's invasion of Capitol Hill shows what happens when people are told that the election has been stolen from them and that there is a chance to take it back.
Biden went on to cite the bipartisan agreement leading to the 1983 Social Security amendments: That's the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security's not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table.
All three major U.S. stock indexes are in a correction, having declined beyond 20 percent from their highs.
Alexandria officials said a resident who tested positive for the coronavirus had been in contact with a District resident with the virus who was associated with Christ Church and had spent time at the Immanuel Chapel of the Virginia Theological Seminary, according to a news release. The age and gender of the person was not immediately available.
About 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.
Ongoing maintenance and capital reserves : Sellers should remember to budget for ongoing maintenance (leaky toilets, appliance repairs, etc.) and larger capital expenses (roof repairs, HVAC repairs, etc.). Ten percent of gross rents is a good rule of thumb.
The $2.2 trillion aid legislation, passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, directed the Treasury to look at Americans' 2019 or 2018 tax returns to determine if they are eligible for a payment. But the law also said Treasury should look at Social Security data for seniors and the disabled.
The move came hours after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra led a coalition of 17 Democratic state AGs in filing an appeal to challenge the district court's ruling.
Mario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small insurer that is a big player in both the Medicaid market and the exchanges, said that the bill does not inspire confidence.
They're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. And the takeaway I hear from a lot of Democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. It was about people going into their camps early. This year, it's the opposite; Democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.
With turnover comes fresh energy and new perspective and people who are very connected with their constituents and that's the positive side, he said, but the down side is you lose seniority and the ability of members to look out for the needs of the commonwealth.
She reprints transcripts of hearings at which she grilled John Kelly, initially a nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, positioning the Trump administration's immigration policy as its defining debacle. She pitches ideas such as mental-health career training similar to Teach for America or the Peace Corps, and calls for the DEA to go after pharmaceutical manufacturers while the war on drugs is wound down.
The salaries of men's general manager Brian McBride and women's GM Kate Markgraf were not listed on the latest tax form because they were hired in the past six months.
President Trump said he may declare a national emergency to get funding for his border wall depending on how negotiations develop:
For me, it means that I can start building the life that I want, Geary said, rather than having to go along with what other people had planned for me.
But the city has since extended the recommendation to include people at the church March 4 through March 6, to account for the days Smith was there. Smith played at a funeral on March 6, and those who attended that service are also being alerted, the church said in an email to members. City officials want people to stay isolated until two weeks have passed since their last time at the church.
Organizers said parts of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival would be shelved, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon had its city permit pulled, and the St. Patrick's Day parade scheduled for Sunday was postponed indefinitely.
I think after I called my parents, you're the first person I called after I adopted my kid, that's how much I think of you, said Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax), his voice breaking. You are proof, Mr. Speaker, that nice guys can finish first.
I can't be the only one who was intrigued — downright curious, to be honest — by the solitary, seemingly contemplative woman pictured at the Lincoln Memorial at dawn on Dec. 27, the day President Trump signed the $900 billion relief package [Treasury aims to begin sending relief money this week, news, Dec. 29]. Who is she? What was she doing there? Had she been there all night, perhaps a sentinel of some kind?
Sepp says the Greens got it right by sticking to nuts-and-bolts information about their property, rather than complaining that their assessment was unfair. A homeowner who marshals proper evidence, sticks to facts rather than make political statements and follows procedure is more likely to meet with success because they've made their own luck, Sepp said. You wouldn't go into traffic court to challenge a parking ticket by arguing the mayor is corrupt. Rather, you'd provide evidence you were parked there properly during nonpaying hours.
We found no evidence these protests spread. When a protest occurred in one country in this period, it did not significantly increase the likelihood of similar protests taking place in neighboring countries. This was true not just of democracy protests, whose primary demand is open and competitive elections, but also for other forms of anti-government protests, such as the yellow vest protests.
But losing the seat on the committee doesn't spell disaster.
It's not just Warren drawing interest in what amounts to the widest-open caucus competition since 2004.
The proposed 2018 budget includes a moderate amount of new spending compared with last year's plan. Leggett urged restraint in light of economic challenges and uncertainties at the federal and state levels.
By not asking for a subsidy increase, Metro could save the jurisdictions tens of millions of dollars, according to Wiedefeld's latest $1.89 billion operating budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year, which starts on July 1. An exact figure wasn't available Monday.
They knew I didn't have good papers, said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.
Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we often warn about campaign attacks highlighting certain votes or comments that are so old they often lack context. Overall, Sanders offers a misleading portrayal. So here's a guide to these statements.
That, too, is part of the Trump business legacy. Over his multiple decades in the real estate industry, he has walked away from bad or failing projects, such as his casinos in Atlantic City.
Leasing fees : It takes work to find a tenant. Management companies typically charge one month's rent to find a tenant.
●Rep. Gerald E. Connolly expects to be named chairman of a subcommittee within the Oversight Committee, which will interview President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, next month.
Our Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Paul Sonne have reported Wilkie built his career working alongside polarizing figures and was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends Confederate symbols. CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.
The Internal Revenue Service deadline of April 15 for income and corporate taxes remains unchanged.

The article put a lot of emphasis on op-eds that caused controversy over the past year, rather than op-eds that advanced public policy debates and helped to develop an informed consensus. The real story is that op-eds, when done right, make us think and help us understand — they build consensus on policy concerns and contribute to a public debate.
Ragan Dickens, Walmart's national director of media relations, said in an email statement, We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect. While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations. Adam's attorney did not respond to email or phone messages seeking comment.

But this year, April 16 falls on a Sunday, so the District will celebrate the holiday the following day. D.C. holidays are treated as federal holidays for tax-filing purposes, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
Howell has used his position — among the most powerful in state government — to help thwart many of the governor's biggest goals, including the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the appointment of a state Supreme Court justice and the blanket restoration of voting rights to more than 200,000 felons.
In his Dec. 31 Style article, Throwaway lines in the literary life? Not really., Michael Dirda described Progress and Poverty as Henry George's masterpiece of socialist thought. To the contrary, George rejected socialism, and his masterful analysis of economic problems, a bestseller in the 1880s and still applicable today, includes an analysis of why governmental direction and interference were not the answer to continued poverty and unemployment amid material progress.
The insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them. The bill keeps in place those tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that help lower the out-of-pocket costs for people based on their income — until 2020.
For a lot of people with disabilities, their self-awareness of what their future can look like is very low, Lee said. A lot of it is about introducing them to businesses or career paths they never knew existed.
Lots of times, people with disabilities don't want to disclose that they're disabled, because they're scared they won't be interviewed, Beck said. The way Jim and InReturn are approaching businesses is about trying to integrate people with disabilities into the business strategy, as opposed to the opposite. It's a whole new approach.
Many Democrats bristle at the idea of wealthy candidates buying their way into politics, at any level. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who defeated wealthy Total Wine founder David Trone to win his seat in Congress, said he found voters receptive to the idea that candidates should earn their way into politics.
There is a general-information phone number, 800-829-4477, but most of your questions can be answered on the IRS website, Irs.gov.
The broad outlines of the plan was recommended by the National Commission on Social Security Reform and is believed to have strengthened the long-term health of Social Security. Sanders, in 1999, praised the 1983 law an example of bipartisan cooperation.

On Tuesday, officers responded to the 7900 block of John Adams Court after a 27-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint while moving out of her apartment, Fairfax County Police said in a statement. The suspect fled after a neighbor heard the woman screaming.
On March 18, the stock market took another hit amid coronavirus fears as the Dow fell 1,300 points, nearly erasing the gains made under President Trump. (Reuters)
The Episcopal Dioceses of Washington and Virginia said churches including Washington National Cathedral would close for two weeks. The Walter E. Washington Convention Center canceled upcoming events, as did the promoter of concerts at the Anthem, the 9:30 Club, the Lincoln Theater and U Street Music Hall.
— ICYMI: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized in late December its overhaul of Medicare's so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) program — and the agency followed through on stricter rules that could expose these health savings cooperatives to losses sooner. The Health 202 detailed the proposed new rules here.
In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said there's no question President Trump is a racist:
A USSF spokesman said the organization did not want to comment on the salary differences. The latest 990 tax form is for the fiscal year from April 2018 through March 2019, but the USSF said salaries are for the entirety of 2018.
Gottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the New York Times's Sheila Kaplan reports. The commissioner also wants the companies leaders to come to the agency to explain their plans.
Other candidates have been bolder about dipping into their own finances. Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg has hinted that he could spend up to $100 million on a campaign, similar to the spending in his mayoral elections. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, is worth an estimated $2.7 billion and has not ruled out spending his own money; Richard Vague, an obscure businessman who recently visited with South Carolina Democrats, has not commented on the topic.
2) A replacement for the individual mandate that will encourage healthy people to sign up for insurance
We also anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform, Henry said. That provides us flexibility to continue to allocate significant capital to shareholders while we also fund increased capital spending and our restructuring program over the next few years.
Something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.
House Minority Leader David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) praised Howell for standing up to his own party on an off-year redistricting scheme in 2013. Senate Republicans had tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor technical adjustments to House districts. Howell ruled it out of order, a move that infuriated some Republicans.
Though it's not in the Twitter thread, we are going to add one more example, sent to The Fact Checker by Sanders research director Tyson Brody, since it might appear in some future attack.
In 1980, the New York Times explained how Trump finessed the zoning board for the development of Trump Tower. After quoting a business partner of Trump's, who said that Trump knows how to get things done in New York, the paper explained: In part, that is a matter of politics. The only donor who gave more money than Trump to the campaign of the incumbent governor, it reported, was the governor's brother. While a deputy mayor also said that Trump could be very convincing when selling a project, a city council member told the Times that Trump runs with the same clique that continues to manipulate things behind the scenes in this city, including links to a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn connected through his father.
At times over his first two years in office, Trump was unable to even navigate issues popular with the Republican base and that didn't require a 60-vote margin. He deferred to congressional leaders on the outlines of an overhaul to the Affordable Care Act, later disparaging a House-passed bill before it got to the Senate. When a reform effort came to the Senate under reconciliation rules that required only 50 votes, Trump could not persuade those easy-to-deal-with politicians to pass it, despite his party's majority.
In the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, along with two Republican senators and another Democrat (Max Baucus of Montana), proposed a simple solution — a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.
Montgomery Public Schools continue to claim about half of county spending. The 159,000-student system would receive $2.3 billion under Leggett's proposal, about $25 million over state-mandated funding levels. That is significantly less than last year's increase, which was nearly $90 million more than the state minimum. Montgomery College would receive $2 million over state requirements, bringing its annual operating budget to $309 million.
Property management : Homeowners often overlook property management costs (roughly 8 to 10 percent of gross rents) in our area. Even if homeowners plan to manage properties themselves, they should account for the value of their own time and effort.
This week's best travel bargains around the globe.
The Oscar buzz for Vice is waxing and waning, but this explains why there's an audience for it — frustration with the rehabilitation of the Bush administration's reputation.
The same year, Gregg Berhalter, coach of the middling U.S. men's squad, received $304,113 in base salary and a substantial bonus — except he had been on the job for only a month.
Another benefit of appealing your assessment: When you successfully lower your property tax rate, it resets from that lower rate for years to come. By the way, it did not affect the value of our house when we sold, Alicia Green said. I imagine people would wonder that. It's a common misconception, but think of it this way: Lower property taxes are a benefit for potential buyers as well.
Many of you asked me what Bernie had to say, assuming him or someone from his team obviously would have reached out to me after the story broke, Mendieta wrote. No, he did not and they did not. It was crickets.
But the challenge goes beyond changing the way companies see workers with disabilities; it's also about helping these workers access all the opportunities available to them, said Chris Lee, who is working with InReturn to set up a pilot program with the Kansas State School for the Blind.
In 2007, NBC reported that as president, Joe Biden's Social Security plans 'would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age.'
Her supporters note that several states have expanded school choice programs and say DeVos's advocacy made a difference in the public debate. But the issue went almost nowhere in Washington.
Richard Ojeda. He said he's resigning from the West Virginia state Senate to focus on a presidential run. Ojeda's resignation will allow Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice to appoint a replacement, though the seat will be on the ballot again in 2020.

He argued that his district, with proximity to eight major military installations, including the largest naval base in the world, relied heavily on federal appropriations.
●See if the comparables are really comparable. The government's internal notes will also include comparable properties the assessor used to help determine the value of your house. Look for reasons the properties the assessor chose are not appropriate. Are they bigger? Newer? Newly remodeled? Do they have watertight roofs, while your house needs a new one, as the Greens' did? Next, identify three to six alternative comparables that are more favorable to you. You can find them free using such websites as Redfin, Trulia and Zillow. Or you can consult a real estate agent or appraiser.
The teams, however, have separate collective bargaining agreements, and the men do not receive base salaries. Most of the men's earnings come from contracts with professional clubs around the world.
Insurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.
She took a pen and crossed it out, she said. She crossed out our names.
According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.
Her supervisor asked her to sign her name to receive a pin, but Morales said she explained that she did not know how to write, so she didn't sign. I told them I couldn't write, so they let me go at that, she said.
The Post would not have tolerated homophobic or transphobic jokes in this (or any other) column, nor insensitive and stereotypic jokes at the expense of women, Black people or people with disabilities. Therefore, I am at a loss why The Post still considers such blatant ageism as falling within its editorial standards.
He should run, and he should make sure he has a diverse campaign staff that has one of the strongest harassment policies of any campaign, said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has repeatedly encouraged Sanders to seek the White House. He should run because every 50 years or so, someone has the opportunity to fundamentally reimagine the possibilities of our political conversation.
I emailed the article to friends and colleagues and would have liked to notify those who worked on it with me, but to do so after 50 years would necessitate there being email in heaven, as I am one of the few survivors. Actually, I would prefer there not be Internet in the great beyond, as I want peace and tranquility when I pass on. Thanks for this review, which brought a smile to this aged cartographer at the end of a troubled 2020.
President Trump's budget, which will be released Thursday, is expected to include historic shrinkage in the federal workforce that could hit hard in Montgomery, where more than 45,000 federal workers reside.

But seriously: Barring some wild, unexpected development, Harris is expected to enter the 2020 presidential primary, with most speculation putting her in the race by the end of January. If and when she does, it would fulfill a promise that many politicians and operatives saw in Harris years ago.
●Look for errors on your property work sheet. Contact your tax assessor's office and request the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Different jurisdictions call this paperwork different things, including property work sheet and property card. What you're requesting are the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Study these documents, checking for lot size, house age and dimensions, number of bedrooms and baths, most recent purchase price, and anything else that could affect your home's value. If you find mistakes that make your property seem more valuable than it is, that is strong ammunition. This is the tactic the Greens used when they pointed out that their house had two bedrooms, not three.
— Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, who has been the subject of multiple reports about his previous affiliation with Confederate groups, failed to disclose that affiliation to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during his confirmation process, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski reports.
Investors said corporate debt markets also are not yet operating smoothly. Companies have taken advantage of record-low interest rates in recent years to load up on debt. That strategy worked well so long as short-term borrowings could be periodically refinanced.
Mayhew, long a critic of expansion under the ACA, was praised by CMS administrator Seema Verma in a Friday statement. I am excited for Mary as she transitions to serve Governor-elect DeSantis and the people of Florida, Verma said. I appreciate her efforts at CMS and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she uses her many talents to help the state of Florida create a healthcare system that serves the needs of its citizens.
1995: Biden offers to cut $89 billion from Medicare.
Those with high functioning autism lack pragmatic language skills, skills we use in daily interaction with others, the family wrote in the testimonial. Employers need to be aware of these challenges and find a way to bridge the gap.
Her legacy is clearly one of disdain for the public good in higher education, students' rights and lawful proceedings of government, said Toby Merrill, director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, a legal-aid group.
Rather than an intelligence fiasco, the tunnel provided the West with a wealth of information about Soviet military capabilities and intentions. At a time before U-2 planes and spy satellites were operating and there was high anxiety about a Soviet surprise attack, the tunnel intelligence calmed President Dwight D. Eisenhower's fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor.
After Cole's diagnosis, city officials urged people who had been at the church on Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 — days when Cole was there — to quarantine at home and monitor themselves for symptoms.
They've been hungry for this presidential campaign to start in a real way, Kochel said. That's what you'll see with attendance and turnout early this year. They are champing at the bit to get started.
The Greens ended up appealing their property tax assessment several years in a row and won every single time. Fighting our tax assessment was less time-consuming than filling out my kids' summer camp forms, Alicia Green said. And for the time invested, you get money back instead of forking it over. The Greens estimate that they spent about five hours and saved at least $5,000 in property taxes over the seven years they lived in that house. We made a strong, truthful argument, and it was effective, Green said.

The uncertainties we are facing at the federal and state levels are a necessary backdrop to your consideration of the FY 18 Operating Budget, Leggett said in his letter to Berliner.
But everything changed after Geary connected with InReturn Strategies, a start-up intent on making hiring more inclusive by bridging the gaps between employers and job candidates with disabilities. Its founder, Jim Atwater, helped Geary prepare for interviews, showing him how his perspective and experiences could be an asset to potential employers.
And it's not just about the elite 'legacy' publications defined as two newspapers in New York and one in D.C. Having spent more than 30 years offering thought-provoking op-eds to newspapers around the country, I can attest that there are thousands of outlets with thriving op-ed pages that are trusted and needed. They help readers understand what's going on in the nation, in their state capitals and in their local communities, whether it's redistricting, budget priorities or environmental concerns.
Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.
The ruling means that the county will receive about $30 million less in state income tax revenue each year. It must also pay $27 million a year in refunds between 2019 and 2023.
Our forthcoming research on the diffusion of democracy protests suggests they should not. Protests about domestic issues, we find, do not generally spread from one country to its neighbors. But here's what can spread: the symbols and approaches that highly visible protests use. Let us explain.
Here's more of what companies wanted, and what they got:
Again, you can see Biden's comments mostly are intended to rebut Republican hopes for private Social Security accounts. Raising the cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security tax — currently $137,700 — was a common proposal by Democrats at that time.
Howell, 73, announced his decision Monday in emotional remarks in the ornate House chamber, with his wife of 50 years, Cessie, and other family members looking on.
In 1996, Joe Biden floated the idea of reducing Social Security benefits through an early version of chained CPI.
Health officials also expanded a self-quarantine recommendation for people who have visited Christ Church Georgetown, which is now linked to three confirmed coronavirus cases.
All of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.
Executives declined to say which factories the company would be closing, citing the need to consult with unions, work councils and other stakeholders. They said some of the savings would be used to expand production at other facilities.
The county will also feel the continuing effects of the Supreme Court's decision in the Wynne case. The court ruled that a state law denying residents a full credit for taxes paid on income earned outside Maryland constituted illegal double taxation and ordered refunds issued to residents who had filed claims.
Unraveling it would require legislation or another complex rulemaking process.
Others were on a pay scale higher than Ellis's in 2018.
Dear Heloise: With a big family, keeping the kitchen clean is a challenge. After meals, I fill the sink with hot, soapy water, then add the silverware and plates to soak. (I don't, however, soak knives or anything with sharp points.) This really helps after a cheesy or greasy meal.
Mnuchin said direct deposits should begin by April 17, followed by checks in the mail. About 60 percent of tax filers gave the IRS direct-deposit information in recent years, said Nicole Kaeding of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. The IRS said there would soon be a web-based portal for people to update their direct-deposit information.
Those figures, as well as new coach Vlatko Andonovski's salary, will appear on next year's tax records.
Gillian Brockell's Jan. 4 Retropolis article Controversial Lincoln statue is removed in Boston, but remains in D.C. misrepresented Frederick Douglass's comments on the Emancipation Memorial. According to Brockell, Douglass suggested that the statue depicting Abraham Lincoln and an African American freedman be replaced or added to. In fact, Douglass never suggested that the statue be removed or replaced.
The amendment itself does not mention Social Security. Biden tried to pass an amendment exempting Social Security, but he did not get the necessary votes. Social Security at the time was running huge surpluses, helping to mask the full extent of the budget deficit.
Finally, if there is significant appreciation in the property, an owner may lose out on a valuable tax break. The U.S. tax code allows homeowners who have lived in a home at least two of the previous five years to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000 for a married couple) from their taxes. Homeowners who rent out their home for more than three years therefore will lose out on this valuable exemption. (Consult an accountant on this.)
Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.
Speaker William J. Howell, a pragmatic Republican who has presided over Virginia's fractious House of Delegates for 15 sessions and spent the last four as a thorn in Gov. Terry McAuliffe's side, will not seek reelection in November.

Hawley, Cruz and Trump, too, are pursuing short-term political gain at the risk of long-term chaos. Their political theater leaves something — a big something — to chance. They justify their actions as a response to the demands of their constituents. But those actions set precedents and change beliefs about what politicians can and cannot legitimately do when they don't like election results. What will happen when other politicians decide they can make up the rules as they go along? Already, the Republican majority in Pennsylvania's Senate removed the lieutenant governor from presiding on Tuesday, because they didn't want to seat a Democratic senator who had won his election. While they justified this as a response to a unique set of circumstances, they too are setting precedents that others will follow.
Metro's proposed budget includes $1.15 billion in subsidies, less than the $1.25 billion Metro had counted on receiving at the beginning of the current fiscal year. That amount was later revised down in November to $1.11 billion.
Beyond the issue of where the beer is made, the lawsuit is partly based on the fact that it's not craft beer, a claim that Trouble Brewing never makes outright on its label, though Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart, told me, We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you'd expect of craft beer. The Brewers Association, a national trade group for small brewers, defines craft brewery as being small (under 6 million barrels produced per year); independent (less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer) and traditional (making traditional beers, not flavored malt beverages, alcoholic sodas or other products). Further, Julia Herz, the Brewers Association's craft beer program director, told me last month that we do not classify contract companies as brewers because they don't have a brewers' notice from the Tax and Trade Bureau.
The new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.
In her first year in office, she delayed an Obama-era regulation that granted loan forgiveness to borrowers who had been defrauded by their colleges, known as borrower defense to repayment. Her move was challenged in court and in Congress but took effect in July. It limits the time borrowers have to apply for relief and requires they prove financial harm.
Opportunity costs: The opportunity cost is defined as what the homeowner could earn on the equity in his home if it were invested elsewhere. Sometimes, the opportunity cost can be substantial. For example, homeowners with $100,000 in equity in their home (after paying off all debt, taxes, fees, etc.), should factor in an additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000 per year, depending on what the expected return on capital might be.
Bond prices also fell, sending yields higher, and oil prices plunged to an 18-year low amid continued uncertainty over the duration of the coronavirus shutdown.
Be aware of tax-related scams. The IRS will NOT initially contact you via email, text message or telephone. Don't reply to the email, and don't open attachments on a suspicious email.
With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.
Health-care experts say that those who are sick should stay home and that everyone should wash their hands thoroughly and regularly, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Those with compromised immune systems are also advised to take precautions.
Executives cited declining fertility rates in the United States and South Korea as factors that have contributed to a decline in diaper sales, long considered one of Kimberly-Clark's bedrock lines of business. Competition is also heating up. Amazon.com, for instance, launched its own private label brand of diapers late last year. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
The 2018 tax form also shows chief executive Dan Flynn was the USSF's highest active employee that year at almost $900,000 in base salary and bonuses. Jay Berhalter, the chief commercial and strategy officer, was close to $800,000.
The result was an annual drubbing of DeVos by congressional committees in service of proposed cuts that were never going to happen anyway. That was never more painful than in 2019, when DeVos absorbed three days of hits over a proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics that the White House had insisted upon, only to watch as Trump dramatically announced that he was restoring the funding.
But that gain was wiped out on Wednesday, as investors sold stocks despite extreme government intervention aimed at cushioning the economy against a coronavirus-fueled recession. The Federal Reserve began the week by slashing interest rates to near zero and reviving a financial crisis-era quantitative easing program, and on Tuesday the central bank announced plans for a special fund to keep credit flowing during the coronavirus outbreak.

The federal bailout was a needed injection for households and several industries, but it didn't directly provide financial help to local governments served by the Metro system.
Aside from Appropriations, Virginia's established members in the Democratic majority will move up the ranks on high-profile committees.
Dear Heloise: I pop into the copier room at my office once or twice a week and pick up the used computer paper. My grandkids love it! A fresh box of crayons, the paper and my grandchildren make for a special and fun afternoon.

The annual subsidies that Metro gets from regional and state governments make up more than half of the system's annual operating budget. Revenue from fares, parking, advertisements and other services make up the rest.
Bowser announced six new coronavirus cases, including two not linked to any known source of infection, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the District, Maryland and Virginia to at least 34. Officials in Alexandria, Va., announced the first case there late Wednesday.
But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.
In 2017, with the GOP in charge of the House, Scott W. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL elected from Virginia Beach, did the near-impossible, winning a seat on the Appropriations Committee as a Republican freshman after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, personal letters and a two-page flier extolling his virtues.
Insurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.
Her work was welcomed by conservatives who argue that power over education belongs with parents, not systems.
One possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.
Sanders here cites a newspaper clip that says an array of liberal-leaning groups — not just senior groups — were angry at Biden for supporting an amendment to the constitution mandating a balanced budget. The fear was that such an amendment would force reductions in domestic spending.
Second, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.
Instead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.
We're so ready, said Susan Leonard, 64, a co-founder of the group. Her 200-member organization campaigned for J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). Now they're turning to 2020.
Tab Ramos, the former under-20 men's coach and youth technical director, made $460,000 overall. He is now coaching MLS's Houston Dynamo.
In the end, the three-term Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) was nominated for the Appropriations slot.
Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list — Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.
The Fed's intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress, the pair wrote in The Financial Times.
The delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.
It's a money grab, Kmt says about ATS's motivations.
Working toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for Medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. The next year, House Democrats cosponsored H.R. 676, a Medicare for all bill.
By letting the dishes and utensils soak, I'm saving time, which makes cleanup a breeze.
1. New campaign slogan: Somewhat Alert at Times.
Like democracy protests, the French yellow vest protests are not good models for protests in Egypt and other countries where fuel prices are high. That is because France is a Western democracy where freedom of speech is not only protected but also extolled. It is also known for its protest culture; its citizens and voters could reasonably expect their government to make concessions, as indeed happened.
In the last edition of The Trailer, you learned that the special election to replace Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), a former state senator from Virginia, could say something about how votes were moving in the suburbs. On Tuesday night, Democrat Jennifer Boysko won Wexton's old 33rd Senate District by the biggest landslide since it was created — a 39.7-point landslide over moderate Republican Joe May.
There are a lot of reasons that the current fight with Congress is unwinnable for the president. He chose to make a stand on his most politically divisive proposal precisely because it is so divisive and, therefore, so important to the most vocal part of his base. But it also gives his opponents even less incentive to side with him than they might otherwise have. He has been ineffective at making his case, in part because the case he's making is the same one he has made over the entire course of his political career. He is left flailing, with no obvious way out but to fold.
Meanwhile, both parties now appear to have abandoned any pretense about caring about budget deficits. Biden's campaign platform calls for raising Social Security payroll taxes on wealthier Americans and boosting benefits for people who have been receiving Social Security payments for at least 20 years.
City health officials earlier Wednesday had recommended canceling all non-essential mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more through the end of the month.
So what should the Fed do then? Well, in this case, the easy answer is the correct one. It should wait. That's because we don't know how much of today's growth will go away tomorrow once the stimulative effect of Trump's tax cuts fades away. Or how much of the slowdown in the rest of the world will put a speed limit on our own economy. Or whether higher wages will continue to suck more people into the workforce, as they did last month, or are instead a sign that companies are starting to run out of workers.
The $5.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, holds the line on taxes while increasing spending on schools, affordable housing, libraries and code inspections in apartment buildings.
She'll be remembered as an unapologetic voice for expanded school choice, and I think after racking up no legislative victories over the past four years, it's hard to see a lot of concrete impact of that, Hess said in an interview.
I'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.
This intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.
Some companies are beginning to understand the untapped value of workers with disabilities. Microsoft has a dedicated website for job-seekers with disabilities to learn about the company's hiring practices and accommodations. Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Ford and other giants have neurodiversity hiring initiatives to seek employees with neurological differences, such as autism, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
A failure to see — and show
Her party's left, which has accused her of being cautious and resisting criminal justice reform ever since she moved out of the DA's office, does not get much detail about why she picked some fights and avoided others. The president's party, which is itching to run a 2010-style campaign against Harris as an embodiment of sanctuary cities and #MeToo politics, comes away with more material.
If the number of people with disabilities in the labor force grew just 1 percent, the nation's gross domestic product could expand by as much as $25 billion, the Accenture report found.
We've got invitations out to several presidential candidates already, Leonard said. It's a big group, and we want to hear their ideas.
Levine is quick to point out that his calculators are meant to complement, not replace, the net price calculators that colleges have been required to post online since 2011. But the net price calculators are often cumbersome. Levine and other experts say many users, facing a slew of complicated questions about tax returns, assets and home equity, fail to take advantage of them.
The thing that has me the most concerned is the speed and severity of what's playing out here, said Gibson Smith, a prominent bond fund manager with Denver-based Smith Capital Investors. There's just a lot of stress in the system.
The present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, Molina said. I'm actually more concerned about Medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.
Like most investors, Moody's anticipates a wave of credit downgrades and corporate debt defaults. Energy companies hit by the abrupt oil price decline and businesses that are most exposed to the evaporation of consumer spending — such as airlines, hotels, cruises, and automakers — face the greatest risk.
A Chained CPI — Chained Consumer Price Index — is a different way of calculating increases in the cost of living. It assumes people adjust buying patterns when prices changes, and it results in a slightly lower rate of inflation. So benefits for programs such as Social Security grow at a slower rate — what Sanders calls a cut.
The Times also reported that the final negotiated height of Trump Tower was 56 stories, not 68.
Indeed, markets for U.S. government and corporate debt strained to handle a flood of sell orders. Investors sold 10-year Treasury securities to raise cash, sending prices down and yields up to 1.2 percent. The 10-year yield has more than doubled since March 9, when stocks and bonds began plunging in tandem. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
●Meet the deadline. Tax assessments in the District, Maryland and Virginia are mailed out January through March. (In some parts of the country, they arrive in the last quarter of the year.) Once you receive your assessment, you typically have just 30 to 120 days to file your appeal. Check the rules for your jurisdiction and make sure your paperwork is postmarked by the deadline.
While Metro did not receive a specific request, [Wiedefeld] is aware that our funding jurisdictions did not receive additional revenue in the recent Covid Relief package and face enormous financial pressures, Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said in a statement.
Howell is Virginia's second-longest-serving speaker, behind Democrat Edgar Blackburn Moore, who held the post from 1950 to 1968.
Many immigrant families are also learning that they are ineligible. In order for anyone in the family to receive a payment, each person in the household — including children — is supposed to have a valid Social Security number.
Sanders, who resents what he sees as the tabloid approach of much political coverage, was pilloried for the busy quote; the senator, who tends to ignore shouted questions in the halls of the Senate, decided to handle the new story on its own, with a mea culpa, no spin and a small aside about how he had instituted strong anti-harassment policies during his 2018 Senate campaign.
In the mid-1990s, Joe Biden was criticized by seniors' groups for supporting balanced budget amendments that would cut Social Security.
Having talked to a lot of them and hearing about their situations and comments that were coming up again, it's just one of the options we wanted on the table, said Smedberg, who represents Virginia cities and counties on the board.
At various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.
— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.
Chief Financial Officer Maria Henry said the company's gains from the tax overhaul would help offset the cost of the restructuring plan. The company had an effective tax rate of 28.6 percent in 2017, and the rate would drop to between 23 and 26 percent in 2018 as a result of congressional action, boosting year-over-year earnings growth by 6 percentage points, she told analysts during a conference call to discuss recent financial results.
The shooting comes six days after four other people were shot and wounded in separate shootings in two hours on Feb. 23, along a six-block stretch of the same street.
An administration official said Clinton decided yesterday morning to name Reno, after interviewing her Tuesday. The Florida native, 54, turned aside a question about how she felt about being appointed to a position that was seen as having been reserved for a woman, saying simply, I'm just delighted to be here and I'm going to try my level best. She said her efforts would include restoring civil rights enforcement as one of the top priorities of the department, seeking to protect America's children from abuse and violence and establishing diversion programs to give nonviolent offenders a new start while incarcerating dangerous and career criminals. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he welcomed the nomination and would schedule a hearing as expeditiously as possible. But committee sources said they did not expect a hearing before next month. Reno, who once swore I would never be a prosecutor because I thought they were more interested in securing convictions than in seeking justice, has been the elected chief prosecutor in Dade County since 1978. She supervises a 900-person office that handles more than 120,000 cases annually. Reno's start in the job was marred by riots that broke out after the 1980 acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of black insurance agent Arthur McDuffie. She has also been criticized for losing several high-profile public corruption cases and for failing to bring charges in other local scandals.
But many of these protesters have made demands, including anti-Muslim demands in Germany, that are very different from those seen in France. These non-French protests were often triggered by events within their own countries and sometimes even began before their French counterparts. In Bulgaria, the so-called yellow vest protests against fuel prices began a week before those in France; protesters only began wearing yellow vests after they had become iconic in France. In Iraq, protests against unemployment, corruption and poor public services had been going on for months before Iraqi protesters began sporting yellow vests last December.
England's Phil Neville is believed to be the second-highest-paid women's coach in recent years with a base salary of at least $350,000.
Iowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against President Trump. There were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with China depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on Iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact Iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the White House.
Mediation between the women's players and USSF broke down in August.
A person close to the organization said that an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.
So why do protests appear to trigger demonstrations in other countries?
She also used executive authority to roll back Obama-era guidance on affirmative action and to require college campuses to recognize free-speech rights.
Speaking at the coronavirus task force briefing on March 17, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced plans to send checks to struggling businesses. (The Washington Post)
The attorney general's lawsuit is still pending. Defense attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case because, among other arguments, they say the statute of limitations has passed on the allegedly fraudulent actions. More than that, the lawsuit has no merit, says Arnold N. Bressler, a senior partner with the New York-based Moses & Singer, the outside counsel that represents Northern Leasing. We feel, as a matter of law, that the case should be dismissed, Bressler says.
The problem is that these institutions — even the Constitution — are shaped by what politicians like Hawley and Cruz say and do, and whether people believe them. If everyone thinks the rules work one way, then they do. But if people's beliefs change, the rules change, too.
In the fall, InReturn was appointed to the CEO Commission for Disability Employment, a group of companies and other organizations working to help people with disabilities achieve and maintain equal access to meaningful employment. Its message of dignified, profitable inclusion is one it hopes can be shared with all companies, regardless of size or field.
I want to continue to remind everyone to be vigilant, Bowser said at a news conference. Our duty now as citizens is to try to contain the spread of germs and this virus in our communities.
In a case study, InReturn brought a group of young people with Down syndrome to an Apple store in Kansas City, Kan. When the store manager asked about their job aspirations, they uniformly said they imagined working in a grocery store or restaurant.
Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.
But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.
It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.
I began my 50-year full- and part-time career with the U.S. Geological Survey in 1965, spending the first few years as a member of the compilation staff for the National Atlas of the United States, and I am proud to be listed on the atlas's acknowledgments page. So I greatly enjoyed the Dec. 27 Outlook essay by Ted Widmer, 765 maps that drew us together, even after a half-century has passed. I do not believe that I ever thought of the book as singing a love song to America; however, with hindsight, it may be an apt description.
Members write letters and try to persuade leadership and members of a steering and policy committee and people close to them using political considerations, relationships, historical precedent, district geography and whatever else they can think of.
The report lays out objections to the Republican plan, including an argument that cutting trillions in taxes for rich Americans, as Republicans have proposed, would increase inequality in the United States. (A separate analysis last year, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, found that 99.6 percent of the savings under Ryan's plan would accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.)
More than 15 million Americans on Social Security do not file an annual tax return because their income is so low, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
●Rep. Donald A. McEachin, who is interested in environmental justice, will sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
The proposed budget holds property taxes essentially flat. The median bill for a $400,000 home would increase by about $20, from $4,106 to $4,126, due entirely to increased property values. With home assessments growing, Leggett's budget reduces the property tax rate by 2.5 cents per $100 of assessed value, from $1.025 to $1.00.
Bernie Agonistes. For two weeks, as he considers whether to run for president again, Bernie Sanders has gotten questions about female former staffers who say they were harassed during his 2016 campaign. Sanders, who put out a statement reflecting previous stories about the staff issues, went further today. In between the rollout of a prescription drug bill and an appearance with furloughed federal workers, Sanders walked up to Senate microphones and delivered a three-minute response to the news of a $30,000 settlement between his former Iowa campaign manager and two staffers.
On Jan. 1, the University of Maryland's men's basketball team received 50 inches of column space — starting on the section front — and a photograph, even though the team lost an unmemorable game (84-73, against Michigan) that it was expected to lose.
— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.
Earnie Stewart received $291,667 of base salary in six months as the men's general manager; he had been hired midway through the year. Stewart, a former national team player, is now the USSF's sporting director, overseeing the men's and women's programs.

Repaying a teacher for such gifts is impossible, recalled Catherine Rampell in her Dec. 25 op-ed, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. She used her space to reflect on the influence of Mr. Greco, an educator she credited with any success [she's] had as a writer.
In 1983, Biden pushed to raise the Social Security retirement age.
Dear Heloise: I read a lot in bed and am always thinking about what I must do the next day.
— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
The Democrat called for expedited approval of benefits to 70,000 additional low-income residents in the state and called for the state's health agency to work with lawmakers to find a way to fund the expanded program. The plan still needs to be approved by federal regulators.
Verhoeven, whose farm and investments have been hurt by the administration's trade war, said Trump's actions make her more interested in the election.
Hutchins alleges in the lawsuit that in 2011 he agreed to a $200,000 deficiency note and a $50,000 promissory note, even though Hutchins in an interview says ATS never loaned him a single dollar of those funds. The restaurant owner alleges he was forced to agree to the notes or ATS would foreclose on Florida Avenue Grill and several units of the Lacey, the neighboring condominium project that Hutchins developed with loans from ATS.
Here's how the system works: Insurers like CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group and Humana submit estimates of how much providing Medicare's prescription drug benefit will cost them, and Medicare in turn uses that estimate to make payments to the insurers.
We're building bridges where there aren't any, said Scott Brouillette, InReturn's chief executive. How are you going to hire someone you don't understand and have no relationships with?
It creates a clear but controversial road map to navigating these highly charged investigations, including mandating a judicial-like process in which the accused has the right to a live hearing and to cross-examine accusers. Supporters say it provided much-needed due-process protections. Opponents argued it would allow assailants and schools to escape responsibility and discourage victims from coming forward.
— In Maine, new Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order to move forward with expanding Medicaid in the state, fulfilling a campaign promise to make doing so her first priority, the Associated Press's Marina Villenueve reports.
Some economists are skeptical that the dollar would become substantially more expensive under a border adjustment. Yet as William Cline of the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington noted, if the dollar does not increase, then foreign companies would be stuck paying the new tax on their sales to U.S. customers.
On behalf of the people of Virginia, I want to thank Speaker Bill Howell for his outstanding service to Virginia, McAuliffe said in a statement. I have tremendous respect for the Speaker and the professional and dignified way he led the House throughout his tenure. I wish him the very best in his retirement.
Ending pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.
Foreign households, governments and businesses — excluding banks — owe a total of $10.5 trillion in loans denominated in dollars, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Of that total, emerging-market economies owe about $3.6 trillion.
Still, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. Welch said he holds out hope Trump would sign such a measure (assuming Democrats could somehow get it through the Senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.
One of advantages of Appropriations is I can pick up the paper in the morning, go in and do something about it, he said. As a subcommittee chairman, he said, you can get the cabinet secretary on the phone and say, 'We got to move on this.'
Matteo Lieb, who works on employment policy and programs at the National Down Syndrome Society, said employers often treat hiring people with disabilities as an act of philanthropy. It should be about snagging the best talent, he said.
If you want to make lasting changes in public policy, you need to enact laws, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government relations with the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities. If you're going to live by executive-branch action, you die by executive action. That's the world we live in.
Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.
A wills and trusts lawyer who practices in a log cabin on the Rappahannock River, Howell assumed the speakership at a time when his party enjoyed a slim majority in the 100-seat chamber. Their numbers swelled as high as 68 during his tenure, which also saw the adoption of a 2011 redistricting map favorable to Republicans. Two lawsuits — one before the U.S. Supreme Court, the other before a state circuit court — challenged the constitutionality of the maps.
Health insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.
Restoring the 2016 borrower defense rule would require negotiated rulemaking at the Education Department, a process that could take months, if not longer. The same is true for restoring the gainful-employment regulation, which penalizes career-training programs for producing too many graduates with more debt than they can repay.
The country had a similar reprieve in 2007 because of Emancipation Day.
The company said Tuesday it plans to dismiss between 5,000 and 5,500 people and sell or close about 10 manufacturing facilities in what chief executive Thomas Falk described in a Tuesday call with analysts as difficult but necessary actions to make the Kimberly-Clark an even stronger company going forward.
Regarding the March 11 Real Estate article Surprise! Your credit score may soon jump up by 10 points.:
My view is that such a significant tax increase in one year means we should not ask the taxpayers to again pay at a greater rate to fund the FY 18 and FY 19 budgets, he said Tuesday in his budget transmittal letter to Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda).
AHH: This year, there will be more female CEOs than men named Michael giving corporate presentations at the year's biggest biotech conference, Stat News reports. Last year, the website had noted there were more Michaels presenting than women at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.
The 37th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference begins in San Francisco.
In 2016, the country had a three-day reprieve on filing taxes because April 16 fell on a Saturday, so the District celebrated the holiday on April 15, a Friday. That moved the tax filing deadline to Monday, April 18.
Morales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: It's no problem here. You don't need papers.
Guerrero trades text messages on a chain with about 25 friends — classmates he hasn't seen since spring break started on March 6. Each day brings more harsh news about people they know getting sick and families hurting for money. His mom's phone pings frequently with SOS messages from college students who can't pay their rent.
Moran, who left Congress in 2014, ticked off a partial list of projects funded through now-banned earmarks through Appropriations: the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, the Springfield traffic interchange, planning for rapid transit connecting Arlington and Alexandria, Four Mile Run, and extension of Metro to Dulles.
The writer is president of the Center for the Study of Economics.
It'd be easy to overdetermine a meaning from this. Just 21,142 ballots were cast, not counting write-in votes, which meant turnout dipped slightly from the 2014 election that first put Wexton in the Senate. But until Tuesday, the record Democratic margin in the district was Wexton's 13.4-point win in 2015, a mediocre year for her party in the state. The collapse of Virginia's Republican Party has sped up since then.
As part of a rules package for the new Congress, the party voted to granted itself the authority to intervene in the lawsuit, and scheduled a vote for this week designed to force GOP lawmakers into a political corner: agree to defend a law many members have spent years reviling or appear to oppose popular ACA protections for millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions that many have pledged to uphold, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.
In general, protests in neighboring countries do not provoke new discontent in other countries [remind citizens of their own discontent]; nor do they bring people together on behalf of existing [that] discontent. In fact, most democracy protests are small, short-lived, repressed and unsuccessful — and are thus poor models for protests in other countries.
The 12-page complaint, published online by Consumerist, reiterates most of the facts laid out in a story I wrote last month, down to quotes from a senior buyer for Walmart's adult beverage team: The four Trouble Brewing beers were created for Walmart by WX Brands, a company that develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world. Though the cans say the contents were brewed by Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y., no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists. They're actually produced at Genesee Brewing, makers of Genesee and Genesee Cream Ale, on a contract basis. Genesee is owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of Costa Rica-based Florida Ice and Farm, which includes breweries among its holdings.
With the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.
We — like Ms. Bowser — have never questioned the desirability of giving families the time off they need to care for newborns or tend to ailing parents. But the District's plan that is set to be enacted into law, barring interference from Congress, is expensive and ill-designed and, in the opinion of the city's chief financial officer, presents multiple risk factors. Not only do most of the benefits go to Maryland and Virginia residents, many of whom already get employer-provided leave, but also it is unclear if a government that still struggles to provide some basic city services is capable of pulling off a program unprecedented in its complexity.
Sanders cites a newspaper clip from Jan. 11, 1983, that says, Biden suggested a gradual increase in the retirement age would help improve the Social Security system. This was not a controversial position at the time. Two months after these comments, large bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate agreed to the Social Security amendments of 1983, which included raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing payroll taxes to improve the solvency of the program.
Jay Inslee. The governor of Washington will make his first visit to New Hampshire since suggesting that he might seek the presidency, making climate change speeches at Saint Anselm College and Dartmouth on Jan. 22.
Even as Metro has been running buses and trains at a reduced level because of lower demand, costs for cleaning, disinfecting and personal protective equipment have risen. Metro officials said they hope to make up the money they wouldn't receive in subsidies through cost-cutting starting in January 2022, the second half of the fiscal year.
I feel like when people feel like they're not knowledgeable in that area, they shy away from it, Blackburn said. Not because they aren't interested in including the population, but because they don't know what to do. And that's where InReturn comes into play.
The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.
House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the newly minted GOP chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed to crack down on the shenanigans played by major drugmakers to limit lower-priced alternative medicines.
Money is tight and his family had to borrow from a relative to pay for his Advanced Placement tests this spring. His parents — an education professor and a golf coach — expect to receive the government relief payment in April, which should help, but they won't get $500 for him.
The Associated Press reported Sanders saying in 1996 that the aging population made it clear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past. The Sanders campaign has insisted adjustments did not mean reductions in benefits.
Atwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what's known as the disability employment gap. As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers. He says members of this demographic are often the last to be hired and the first to be let go, and they are often relegated to jobs below their skill level.
Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.
Some of his friends have lost their after-school jobs. He planned to get one soon to help save for college, but that is no longer possible. He has been applying for college scholarships, but some applications require him to use a fax machine or send a hard copy of his paperwork, and he no longer has access to the school printer.
Verhoeven, who did not caucus for any Democrat in 2016, said that she considered the senator a strong challenger to Trump because the president seemed obsessed with her.
Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.
Between 1989 and 2011, 24 democracy protests began in countries within 45 days of a similar protest in countries within 30 miles of them. But 258 protests — more than 10 times as many — began even though there had not been a similar protest in a neighboring country within the previous 45 days. For instance, in May 2018, Brazilian truck drivers staged massive — and eventually successful — protests against increased fuel prices. Yet we have not seen similar protests in other Latin American countries.
Egypt, in contrast, is an authoritarian state known for being increasingly repressive toward dissenters. Last year, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death for protesting the 2013 coup d'etat that brought the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, to power.
I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this, Meadows said Saturday. But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.
Second, you should look at the actual numbers. Many homeowners do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to see whether renting out the home would cover the direct carrying costs of owning it. The costs they typically consider are their mortgage payment, taxes and insurance. However, the problem is that this quick calculation almost always underestimates the true costs of being a landlord.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the legislation, called it a huge step forward to have Pelosi's support. We have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.
The lawsuit filed by the U.S. women's players against the federation concerns broader issues; the players say there is inequitable compensation and support compared with the men's program.
Colorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.
That's all they've ever seen someone like them do, Atwater said. The visibility to what their opportunities can be is just nonexistent.
His 2019 annual salary was not specified, but based on the latter figure, he was to make between $1 million and $1.2 million.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.
— For the first time, House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare for all, a step that comes as Pelosi has backed the process, as our Post colleague Dave Weigel reports.
We all know that a picture is worth a thousand words. So why neglect to include a photograph of the late Susan Moore, whose video alleged racist treatment as she was dying of the coronavirus with the Dec. 27 op-ed by Aletha Maybank, Camara Phyllis Jones, Uché Blackstock and Joia Crear Perry, Say her name: Dr. Susan Moore. Online, the piece included a photograph that featured a White woman as its primary subject.
The subsidy increase is capped by Virginia and Maryland at 3 percent. Both states passed a law in 2018 limiting subsidy growth as part of a condition of permanently dedicating and significantly increasing money for long-term capital projects. The District did not adopt the limit, and the cap applies only to Metro's operating costs.
Alan S. Macdonald, attorney representing ATS and its owners for the case, declined to comment on the lawsuit, which he had just received.
We really work with employers to have them realize that this is not just something they're doing out of the kindness of their hearts, he said. This is something good they're doing for themselves.
Forget about keeping up with the Joneses. This time of year you want your house to be as crummy as possible. Why? Because it's property tax assessment time, which means it's also assessment appeal time. And if you can successfully argue that your house isn't worth as much as the government says it is, you can save a bundle of money on your property taxes.
The governor told residents to brace for social-distancing measures and warned of significant disruption to your daily lives for a period of time. He urged local governments to consider canceling large events, ordered nursing homes to bar nonessential visits, curtailed walk-in visits to the Motor Vehicle Administration and instructed local schools and preschools to be prepared with contingency plans for potential long-term closures.
Why are protests unlikely to spread?
This jolt of Iowa energy for Democrats began in early 2017, as Trump took office and Republicans assumed control of both houses of the legislature and retained the governor's mansion here, he said.
Her most lasting legacy may be a sweeping directive governing how schools handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Those rules, which give more due-process rights to the accused, will be difficult to unwind, though President-elect Joe Biden has said he will try.
So manifest are the problems that it appears Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) may be having a bit of buyer's remorse. After the mayor announced she would not veto the bill, he signaled a willingness to revisit and perhaps refine parts of it. Had he been hoping a mayoral veto would get him off the hook for ramming such a bad bill through the council? Did it suddenly dawn on him the challenges the city faces in coming up with $40 million to $80 million to design a first-of-its-kind technology infrastructure; hiring 113 new government workers with the expertise to implement and administer the program; and finding a place to house both?
Metro officials said none of the local or state governments asked Metro for a break in their subsidy payments. The agency said it wanted to be cost-conscious toward its funding partners.
What I used to say when I was running, my very first line at all the debates, was: Public office is something you earn, not something you buy, Raskin said.
Trump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:
There were concerns that even more people won't file during the pandemic. But the Trump administration ultimately reversed course.
Antlers at Vail, a ski resort in Colorado, has a spring ski special for families, with savings of up to 25 percent. With the Snow Camp deal, a family of four pays $620 a night from March 5-April 23 (a nearly 20 percent discount) and $335 for stays April 1-23 (savings of 25 percent), the last day of skiing at Vail Mountain Resort. Add 10 percent tax. Price includes an upgrade from a one-bedroom condo to a one-bedroom with a bunk-bed alcove that sleeps two kids, one free children's ski rental per adult rental and a chef-prepared dinner delivered to the suite. The resort also has such amenities as loaner sleds, snowshoes and GoPro cameras. Info: 888-268-5377, www.antlersvail.com/specials.
House members on both sides of the aisle praised Howell on the floor not only for his political leadership but also for a quick wit that could defuse tense situations and for a sense of personal friendship.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it.
It's not just American politicians whose artificial dramas can have unexpected consequences. Take British Prime Minister David Cameron. He wanted Britain to remain part of the European Union but worried that the electoral threat from the UK Independence Party might rip open a long-standing divide in his Conservative Party over E.U. membership.
Earlier in the day, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) on Wednesday reported on another new coronavirus case in his state: a male teenager in the Chickahominy Health District, in the area of Hanover County.
The industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S. Hopkins has reported, although he noted many of the hikes were relatively modest amid pressure on the issue.
The longer the economy is in a deep freeze, the strain is only going to increase, said Heppenstall. There's just so much uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. It makes it hard for anyone to plan.
Levine's tool aims to give families a fast and effective answer to the question of whether they could afford a given school at a time when listed prices — counting tuition, fees, housing, meals and other expenses — for private colleges can top $70,000 a year.
Leggett, whose third and final term ends in 2018, said last year's big increase should rule out any hikes over the next two years.
I'll get Congress, Trump replied. I've been getting politicians to pass whatever I wanted all my life. Nobody has more experience — you know, it's sort of interesting, nobody has more experience dealing with politicians. I've been dealing with them all my life.
In 2003, Harris defeated an incumbent to become San Francisco district attorney. She spent seven years in that role, making her first national headlines for refusing to pursue the death penalty. In 2004, that led to a clash with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who spoke at the funeral of a police officer and called it the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law — adding that had she known of Harris's position, she never would have endorsed her.
Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She said she was also stressed out by the intensity of working during Trump visits, when she would arrive at 8 a.m. but often not leave until late at night. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.
Paul Gauguin Cruises is offering free air from Los Angeles and half-off fares on all trips aboard the Paul Gauguin, which sails around Tahiti, French Polynesia and the South Pacific. The deal applies to more than 70 sailings. For instance, the 10-night Cook Islands & Society Islands-Reunion Cruise departing Papeete on July 26 starts at $5,745 per person double (was $11,490) and includes round-trip air from Los Angeles; transfers; all shipboard meals and beverages, including select wines and spirits; gratuities for room stewards and dining staff; and a visit to a private islet. Add $195 in fees. In addition, if the third guest in the same stateroom is 17 or younger, passage is free; cruisers 18 and older pay $125 per night. Info: 800-848-6172, www.pgcruises.com.
— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.
With Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has pledged to double the women's prize money for the 2023 tournament.
Turning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.
This shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.
Last week, the union representing the men's national team players spoke out in support of the women, saying the USSF has been working very hard to sell a false narrative to the public and even to members of Congress. They have been using this false narrative as a weapon against current and former members of the women's team.
We collected daily data from newspapers, NGO reports and so forth on the specific dates in which a democracy protest began and ended in every country around the world between 1989 and 2011. We then examined whether a protest beginning in one country made it more likely that a similar protest would begin in a neighboring country (i.e., one within 30 to 500 miles of its borders) within the next 30, 45, 90, 120 or 360 days.
It took nearly four years for DeVos to dismantle Obama-era consumer protection rules. The Biden administration could restore many of those policies in much less time, but some will be easier than others to revive.
I love Dave Barry, he's funny, and God knows we all need a laugh at the end of a year like 2020. With that said, he had no fewer than five jokes in his Year in Review 2020 column [Washington Post Magazine, Dec. 27] making fun of President-elect Joe Biden's age (he can't remember things, he's out of touch, can't think clearly and so on).
Neighboring countries tend to be similar in many ways. The domestic forces that set off protests in one country may well exist in its neighbors as well. What's more, it is much easier for academics and the news media to take note of protests that happen soon after one other than it is to track all the protests that were not followed by similar events in neighboring countries.
Indoor venues managed by Events D.C. — including the convention center, the D.C. Armory, and the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center — will undergo a deep cleaning in coming days, he said, out of an abundance of caution.
As Blake told me when I interviewed him in 2015 for my book about the Berlin tunnel, slipping disinformation into an enormous stream of genuine communications would have been very easily spotted. Blake was one of only a handful of American and British intelligence officers who knew about the tunnel, and he would almost certainly have been exposed as a spy had the communications been doctored. Despite learning of the tunnel before it was even dug, the KGB opted to protect Blake and not warn Red Army commanders.
The House GOP caucus is expected to name Cox its speaker-designee in a close-door meeting Wednesday.
Biden went on to say: So we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference between the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] figure of 2.6. Take 2.5 — that is $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a bigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is all we need — not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on that.
I keep a notebook on my nightstand. I write down things that are on my mind, like a diary; a list of things I have to accomplish the next day, like a to-do list; and a book review of the book I'm currently reading. This helps organize my thoughts a lot!
Yet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.
The Metro Board ultimately will decide if the transit system can lower its subsidy request. Members will discuss during a Thursday meeting.
Virginia appropriators from the more recent past used their clout to arrange funding for Metro, bridge and highway improvements, defense projects, anti-gang initiatives, and even the Iraq Study Group.
Her tenure also will be known for rolling back Obama-era civil rights protections, including those aimed at protecting transgender students and eliminating racial disparities in school discipline rates. Under DeVos, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights jettisoned most systemic investigations, focusing instead on clearing a significant backlog of cases.
Here's what you missed at President Trump's Jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeff C. McKay (D-At Large) said an increase in Metro's subsidy request would be tough to swallow this year, particularly when Congress didn't include local governments in its bailout.
MAYOR MURIEL E. BOWSER (D) took painstaking care in pointing out to the D.C. Council her grave concerns with legislation establishing an extravagant paid family leave program for people who work in the District. One of the largest tax increases in recent city history, she wrote the council, would be imposed to establish one of the largest government agencies, which would mostly benefit non-D.C. residents, while people who live in the city but work outside it or for the federal government would get nothing. Pretty convincing arguments to veto the bill — but instead Ms. Bowser took the easy way out, at least for her, and decided to let the bill become law without her signature.
Torres's account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.
If you need help with calculating your taxes, you can call 800-829-1040. There usually is a long hold time, especially this time of year. Here's the Heloise hint: Sit in front of your computer, have a book to read or clean out a drawer! Might as well use the time to do something.
Take a family of four with income of $70,000 a year, cash of $5,000, non-retirement investments of $25,000, and home equity of $25,000. If the sibling is not in college, the estimated expected family contribution for Wellesley would be $5,000 to $15,500 a year. If the sibling is in college, the family's contribution range for the women's college would be $3,000 to $9,300 a year. In addition, the calculator tells this prospective student that she would be expected to borrow $1,800 a year and earn $2,100 through a work-study program. The rest of the college's $68,000 annual expense would be covered by grants and scholarships.
It is not too late for the council to undo its mistake and start to act responsibly. We urge it to do so.
In higher education, her most consequential work involved regulating how colleges and other schools investigate sexual harassment and assault under the federal civil rights law known as Title IX. Earlier in her term, DeVos rescinded less formal guidance issued by the Obama administration. The new regulation, published last year, carries the force of law.

The U.S. men have not advanced past the World Cup's round of 16 since 2002, though the number of fully invested programs in the men's game dwarfs the women's game and the pathway to a World Cup berth is much more difficult for the American men.
We can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.
Other DeVos priorities required legislative action, and she was able to move almost none of them through Congress.
Acting D.C. police chief Peter Newsham said there certainly is some kind of dispute going on in the area, but he would not be more specific.
— In Indian Country, the shutdown has meant critical funding hasn't arrived to keep health clinics running. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory, the New York Times's Mitch Smith and Julie Turkewitz write. But that means a government shutdown can largely sideline a tribe's basic functions.
Here's how we did our research
Josh and Alicia Green embraced the concept of trashing their own house, writing a description for their appeal that was the polar opposite of a real estate agent's gushing ad. We reminded them we lived on a busy road, Western Avenue, Josh Green said. We also told the city about costly repairs we needed, like a new roof. In addition, the Greens noticed that the District listed their house as having three bedrooms. But we alerted them that the previous owner had knocked out a wall and made it two bedrooms, thus lowering the value more, Green said.
Tom Steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach Trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. He said in an interview that Trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. He specified the government shutdown and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
During the Obama administration, when the soaring federal deficit again was a major issue, President Barack Obama and then House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) discussed a grand bargain that would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, in addition to reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, in exchange for higher taxes on the wealthy. No deal was ever reached.
Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.
The boost in taxes added to a brewing anti-incumbent sentiment among county voters, who approved a term-limits ballot measure in November.
The Democrats are in a constant hissy about President Trump. It is sustained year around, said David Kochel, a GOP strategist who oversaw Iowa campaigns for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Jeb Bush in 2016. He predicted that Democrats will see a big caucus turn out in 2020.
Third, a would-be seller should consider the soft costs of renting as well. For example, renting can put tremendous wear and tear on a property (both from acts and omissions from a tenant). Tenants typically do not take as good care of the property as does a homeowner. A lot of damage can happen to a home in a short time frame, especially for a single-family detached house.
Authorities say anyone who develops symptoms, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and believes they have been exposed to the virus, should consult their health-care provider about whether to be tested.
Among those deals were some involving McAuliffe's predecessors. Howell spoke out against Democrat Mark R. Warner's $1.6 billion tax hike but quietly instructed a few Republicans to skip a committee vote so that the bill would go the House floor. Despite his distaste for Democrat Tim Kaine's smoking ban, he struck a deal there as well. He signed on to the transportation plan of Republican Robert F. McDonnell, even after the legislation was amended into the largest tax hike in Virginia history.
Or that city Trump built on the West Side of Manhattan.
On the other hand, many economists argue the plan would increase the price of the dollar in global exchange markets, in which case goods produced in foreign countries and sold in foreign currencies would become cheaper, making up for the tax.
Four Democrats have lined up to run for the Arlington County Board a week after longtime board member Jay Fisette announced that he would not seek reelection.
Board members said the lack of an additional subsidy could increase the amount of money the agency requests from federal government next year if ridership doesn't significantly turn around.
This wasn't the first time Republican senators have paid the price for a cynical bargain. Many of them are institutionalists who at first denounced Trump during the 2016 primary race, but endorsed him after he won the nomination and swore he'd grow into the presidency. Asked to justify his fealty, McConnell has pointed to the federal judges and three Supreme Court justices Republicans seated under Trump, as well as tax cuts. But Senate Republicans continued to defend Trump even as he repeatedly sabotaged his own party. There was the pointless 2018-2019 shutdown over Trump's border wall (the longest shutdown in history) and the president's recent threat to veto the coronavirus spending bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, just before the Georgia runoff elections that would decide which party controlled the Senate. There was the Ukraine scandal, which forced the Senate to spend time debating Trump's use of foreign policy for personal gain, even if the GOP did use its majority to acquit him at his impeachment trial. And there was Trump's tight embrace of Saudi Arabia after its leader had Jamal Khashoggi killed, a policy that so outraged Republican senators that they rebuked him for it.
These statements and omissions were material to the transaction at hand, the complaint says, as Plaintiff would not have purchased [the Trouble Brewing beer] otherwise.
Dear Readers: It's tax season! I'm sure most of you have a tax question or two. Help is available by phone or by going on the web.
Perhaps Dirda has forgotten what he learned in the correspondence course in fundamental economics he took when he was 14. Such a lover of literature as he might wish to try reading Progress and Poverty as an adult; it is a literary masterpiece of elegant prose and lucid reasoning.
After the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.
We should remember that in 1982, Social Security was within a few months — a few months — of not being able to pay out all benefits owed to Americans, Sanders said. And then people came together and said of course we want to save Social Security. They worked together, and they did.
Emancipation Day usually is celebrated April 16, the date in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act, which freed about 3,100 slaves living in the District.
Before and during the pandemic, DeVos trained her focus on what conservatives call school choice policies, which allocate taxpayer money to families who choose alternatives to traditional public schools. For DeVos, that includes private schools, religious schools, parent-organized pods, home schooling and charter schools of all sorts.
And that brings us to the most important point of all: What makes a warning a warning is that it happens before things get bad. So yes, the economy is in very good shape right now, but so was it in 2006, the last time long-term rate fell below short-term ones. That didn't keep the economic storm clouds away 12 to 18 months later — that's usually how long it takes for a recession to hit after the yield curve inverts like that — and it won't this time either if we aren't careful.
Tomorrow's Labor Department report of initial jobless claims is expected to show evidence of the first layoffs triggered by the pandemic. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects claims to reach 250,000 this week, up from 211,000 last week and to top 1 million next week.
Hutchins alleges that he offered to give ATS a check for $23,555.30, the total amount of the apparently missing monthly payments, but ATS refused the money and threatened legal measures in an attempt to get Plaintiffs to agree to pay off the mortgages early. At that point, according to the complaint, Hutchins started sending a certified check each month to a new ATS address.
We ought to be building a movement, and the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people, Warren said. Not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we're talking about super PACs, or self-funding.
FIFA, the sport's global governing body, paid $30 million in bonuses at the Women's World Cup last year, including $4 million to the winner.
An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.
Republican freshman Rep. Ben Cline wants Transportation or Agriculture while Rep. Denver Riggleman said his top pick is Financial Services.
Bottom line: A holder of an EdD degree is as entitled to the title doctor as a veterinarian, and certainly as much as a lawyer and much more than a chiropractor.
Newsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.
We added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, Steyer said. Just look at the turnout on November 6: It broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. And subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his Cabinet resigned!
That pushes the official tax-filing deadline to the next business day, April 18. And, everyone — residents of Florida, California and everywhere in between — will receive an extension, not just D.C. residents.
Nathan Beck, who has spent 20 years helping people with disabilities access jobs in Hamilton County, Ohio, said it can be hard to get companies to care.
All of which is to say that the Federal Reserve is in a fairly awkward spot right now. How is that? Well, all of the backward-looking economic data says that we're nowhere near a recession — not when we've added an average of 254,000 jobs a month in the past three months, compared with the 100,000 or so we'd need to keep the unemployment rate from going up — while most of the forward-looking financial indicators say that one might not be that far away. In other words, for every bit of good news about today, such as the continued growth in manufacturing employment, there's a bit of bad news about the outlook for tomorrow, such as the big drop in manufacturing production. Which is why the Fed is justified in thinking that it'll need to raise rates a few times this year to keep inflation in check at the same time that markets are, maybe not equally justified, but still on firm ground in thinking that it's more likely that the Fed will end up cutting them.
Trone went on to win the 2018 election to replace Delaney in another Maryland district; he and all House Democrats will vote soon on the For the People Act, a package of campaign finance and ethics changes that would, among other things, create a robust public campaign finance system. Republicans have said they'd block the legislation in the Senate.
There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'  one Democratic official said. They're worried about defections.
Nobody wants to touch you and people are keeping their distance, he said while having a cigarette outside the convention center. People are very reserved, they're quiet and they seem to have a lot on their minds.
The six new coronavirus cases in the District include a 59-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who traveled abroad; a 58-year-old woman who attended a conference where other participants tested positive; and a 59-year-old woman who came in contact with another person who previously tested positive in the District. Officials said they have not identified a probable source of exposure for the other two people, a man in his early 20s and a 69-year-old woman.
The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now, Pelosi said.
Jan. 15. Brookings India and Tufts University hold a roundtable on 'Opportunities for India Beyond 2019: The Future of Health and Geopolitics' on
For the next 20 years or so, revenues from the Social Security Trust Fund will make it look like we have balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the huge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the rest of federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security, Biden said in his floor speech.
Her final chapter was a consequential one, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down U.S. schools. DeVos joined Trump in pushing schools to reopen for in-person learning, with mixed success. Some experts agreed with her, fearing remote learning is leaving many children behind. Critics noted that the federal government failed to provide schools with clear guidance or funding that would have made it easier to open doors.
Democrats emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map, said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.
Any time he starts calling people names, they're the people who bother him, Verhoeven said. She already knows the enemy, and he knows her.
Cameron thought he'd found a solution: to promise a referendum that would allow the people to vote on leaving Europe. He figured it was only a pretend promise, and domestic and international institutions would save him from having to deliver. And even if the referendum went ahead, British voters would never choose the costly path of unwinding the country's deep ties to the E.U. Everyone who really counted knew that would be stupid, even if they sometimes pretended otherwise. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for instance, began his career making up stories about how the E.U. wanted to do ridiculous things like ban prawn cocktail crisps (a disgusting but popular British delicacy) but also happily described himself as a fan of the E.U.
That Trump's team didn't advance the overhaul legislation is the least surprising part of this. At the same news conference in Iowa, he proudly proclaimed that he was reticent to put together position papers — both because voters don't really care about them (fair enough) and because they would tie his hands in negotiations. Part of it, too, was obviously that the specifics of drafting legislation never appealed to him. So he has continually left the details up to his colleagues on the Hill, then has had to advocate for things that he himself didn't develop. Pun intended.
Our son was at ease, gained confidence and gained success, the testimonial reads. It is our hopes that all companies will get on board and make inclusiveness a priority. There is great talent just waiting to be tapped into.
The Anthem is a huge driver of business for us, said Leeds, referring to the huge new concert venue in Southwest Washington that has canceled all events until April 1.
Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.
Dear Heloise: I have time to go to the gym. However, I've turned my chores into a workout. Trips up and down stairs several times, and carefully bending, stretching and lifting, serve as a great workout — and no gym membership fees!
In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.
This was not an unusual position for a Democrat at the time. A few months later, President Bill Clinton unveiled a budget plan that would have cut Medicare by $124 billion over seven years, a much bigger reduction than suggested by Biden.
For Warren, a Friday night event in Council Bluffs meant for 300 people drew an extra 200. I'm sorry that there's not enough room to get inside, but I'm glad you're all here, she said. She would repeat that apology Saturday when several dozen couldn't squeeze into a panel discussion at a Storm Lake community center.
The losers in all this are the ordinary, non-problem borrowers and renters. Can this be what the voters sought when they elected their attorneys general?
InReturn helped communicate those challenges to potential employers, giving them the context they needed to make their screening processes more inclusive. Within two weeks, the man was hired as a tax associate at a wealth management firm.
Grassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).
They did the same foreclosure move again and basically made me agree to this mortgage, Hutchins says. No money was advanced for this mortgage. . . I didn't have the legal muscle at the time to fight them properly, so I had to assent to the mortgage or else they were going to foreclose on the grill. This is the kind of typical bullying tactics that they've used on me in the past.
●Understand assessment ratios. Some jurisdictions tax your house based on 100 percent of its value, but others assign a lower assessment ratio, such as 60 percent. This means a house with a market value of $100,000 would have an assessed value of $60,000. If you see a number that's lower than your home's true value, check the assessment ratio before assuming you don't have a case. You can find that ratio on your actual tax assessment notice or on the assessor's office website.
Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.
Global viewership of the 2018 men's tournament (64 matches) was three times higher than the 2019 women's competition (52 games), though for the first time, the Women's World Cup surpassed 1 billion viewers over four weeks.
Flynn retired last year, and Berhalter, older brother of the men's coach, is leaving this month.
In trying to have her cake and eat it, Ms. Bowser proved to be just as feckless as the council in setting up the city for enormous fiscal risk. In truth, she may have been even more irresponsible, since some council members seemed to sincerely (but naively) think they were doing the right thing. Instead of being worried about the politics if her veto were not sustained, Ms. Bowser should have stood up for the principles articulated in her letter.
If so, however, the border adjustment would put the squeeze on poor countries where corporations and governments have borrowed money in dollars rather than unreliable local currency. Those borrowers have to make payments on their loans in dollars, and those payments would be harder to make if dollars become more expensive in terms of their own currencies.
Her experience with Trump personally, she added, was not unpleasant. At one point, she recalled, he shook her hand and told her she was doing a good job, before giving her a $50 tip.
It was not the evidence of his savvy that Trump presented in Iowa. Intending the development to feature the tallest building in the world, he had hoped to lure NBC to it. That never materialized, thanks in part to tax concessions that NBC received to stay in Rockefeller Center — concessions that Trump had sought to aid his development project.
Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.
There's lots of people talking about inclusion and making tons of money from consulting, but very few people are doing anything about it, Atwater said. We are the mechanism to turn intent into action.
But fully half of The Truths We Hold covers Harris's time in the Senate, just two years in which Democrats won one epochal battle over health care (at GWU, Harris thanked the late, great John McCain), and sloughed through many more defeats. Harris stands foursquare behind Christine Blasey Ford and the protesters who filled the Senate during the hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh: Their voices, like Dr. Ford's, will have lasting reach.
Despite their different party affiliations, Wolf worked closely with Moran, who also served on Appropriations during the course of his 23 years representing Northern Virginia in Congress.
Rep. Elaine Luria, a former naval commander, is shooting for Armed Services or Veterans' Affairs committees, and Rep. Abigail Spanberger tried for the Agriculture or Intelligence committees.
The teen, who does not attend school, visited a country where there is ongoing transmission of the virus, said Caitlin Hodge, a spokeswoman for the health district. He returned from his trip on March 4, started having symptoms on March 8 and was tested.
There are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to Iowa to meet with Democratic activists. A day after Warren departs Sunday, Julián Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor, is planning stops in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. Delaney, who was the first Democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to Iowa for events Friday and Saturday.
Elizabeth Warren. She will be the keynote speaker at the Feb. 22 McIntyre-Shaheen dinner in New Hampshire.
Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term strike over shutdown, people briefed on the meeting said.
But after her appointment to the position, she waged five successful campaigns for the job – a fact noted admiringly by Clinton yesterday -- and worked to cement good relations with the black and Hispanic communities in Miami. She pushed for a special court to handle drug cases, cracked down on parents who fail to pay child support and presided over the expansion of the county prosecutor's office into one of the largest in the country. Noting that Reno's phone number is listed – unusual for a prosecutor -- Clinton said, She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Before becoming state attorney, Reno was a partner in a prestigious Miami firm that, she noted in a 1984 book on women lawyers, had first refused to hire her after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963 because she was a woman. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Reno offered forthright answers that contrasted with Baird's reticence when Clinton nominated her to the position Dec. 24. She said she was personally opposed to the death penalty but probably asked for it as much as any prosecutor in the country and will advocate for it as the law of the land in particular situations.
The rewards for winning the World Cup are dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the players and federation. Those figures have not been disclosed but reportedly top out at $110,000 apiece.
Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.
As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

Shrift, from the verb to shrive, is confession of one's sins to a priest and presumably forgiveness. This was a rite so important to some Christian believers that it was sometimes done by a priest on the battlefield, with less than proper time or ceremony, for a dying soldier to expiate his sins before meeting his maker. This was known as short shrift, an expression that has come to mean to make a rush job of something. Victims of various plagues in history also got short shrift, without priests to hear their final confessions, and, sadly, many of the more than 350,000 Americans who have died of the coronavirus were also deprived of the comfort of last rites or family in their last hours because of the dangerous contagion of this disease.
When a property isn't selling, owners often asks whether they should consider renting it out. While we are generally big fans of owning investment property, most sellers in this situation fail to think through all of the factors that should be considered in making this important decision.
The final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.
Events D.C., the District's tourism arm, said Wednesday that officials have learned of two other AIPAC attendees — from Ohio and Toronto — in addition to three cases announced earlier.
The highest-paid U.S. coach in 2018, though, was someone long out of a job: Jurgen Klinsmann, the men's boss who was fired in fall 2016. Because he had a long-term contract, the federation had to make payments of $3.35 million in 2017 and $1.475 million in 2018, totaling more than $4.8 million, tax records show.
The authors of the Oxfam report also dispute the claim of GOP proponents that their approach would limit multinational corporations' ability to conceal their profits from federal tax authorities. Yet the report's discussion of the plan's international repercussions points to a major issue that has often been ignored in the political debate over the GOP plan, which has mostly concentrated on how the proposal would affect Americans.
Sanders framed this as 40 years of working with Republicans to cut Social Security. But these statements came during periods when a growing budget deficit was a major concern in official Washington. Biden, like many mainstream politicians, thought action needed to be taken.
Among our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.
Other schools now using the calculator are Amherst, Babson, Boston, Bowdoin, Carleton, Colby, Colorado, Dartmouth, Davidson, Grinnell, Hamilton, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Pomona, St. Olaf, Skidmore, Smith, Vassar and Williams colleges; Brown, Columbia, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Rice, Wesleyan and Washington and Lee universities; and the universities of Rochester and Virginia. U-Va., the only public institution on the list, adopted the calculator in 2015.
I've never been to a rally, but I wanted to for a long time, said Dan Elliott, as he waited in the ornate Orpheum Theatre lobby in Sioux City for Warren to speak Saturday morning. I'm surprised by the energy here. The lines are longer than people expected.

In some cases, Biden offered proposals intended to counter more extreme options offered by Republicans. At other times, Biden indicated a willingness to bargain with Republicans, though any deal resulting in spending reductions in entitlement programs was forever elusive. After 1983, the benefit cuts never happened.
The standoff — which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds — has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.
Molina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.
Each of those candidates comes with different strengths and weaknesses; each, like Harris, has been looked at as the future leader of a new Democratic coalition, as opposed to a candidate such as Joe Biden, who allies say could win back voters the party has lost. One way to read Harris's memoir, The Truths We Hold, is as a pitch to a Democratic base that has shifted since she wrote her first book, on her criminal justice record and agenda.
This is a non-judicial foreclosure, says Anu Kmt, the attorney for the 72-year-old restaurant and its owner. Since the foreclosure did not go through the courts, Hutchins had to file a complaint to seek to halt the proceedings and prove the lender had no right to declare a default on the mortgage.
But the way this unfolded revealed that Bernieworld, which consists of everything from the senator's staff to outside groups such as Our Revolution, is not being careful enough to protect the senator from controversy. The fuse of the harassment story was lit when Arturo Carmona, a former Sanders staffer and congressional candidate, posted photos of his trip to the Sanders Institute Gathering in Vermont last month. Masha Mendieta, who in 2017 had torpedoed Carmona's own campaign by alleging that he'd sexually harassed female staffers, posted an essay on Medium asking how Carmona could have possibly remained in the senator's orbit.
Meanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.
I am way more optimistic than we've ever been before, said Ellen Albritton, a senior policy analyst at Families USA. I think a lot of things are aligning in a way that they haven't aligned before.
Leggett's plan increases spending on affordable housing by $53 million and expands county library hours. It also provides an additional $1.6 million to fund improvements in landlord-tenant relations, required by new legislation. The money would also underwrite a more robust code-inspection program.
In 2014, some conservative Republicans said they feared that Howell was secretly on board with McAuliffe's plan to expand Medicaid as they pushed for a budget amendment that they thought was needed to tie the governor's hands. The speaker had called the amendment unnecessary but eventually got on board. McAuliffe later acknowledged that the amendment blocked a loophole that he had intended to use to expand Medicaid unilaterally.
The lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court spells out the allegations against ATS One Holdings Corp., its affiliated companies and Ari Jay Cohen and Peter Aytug, the principals behind the companies. Hutchins alleges that, starting in summer 2015, ATS began returning the restaurant's monthly mortgage checks as undeliverable, even after Hutchins and his attorney inquired about the lender's apparent (and unannounced) change of address. The lender allegedly didn't provide Florida Avenue Grill with a new mailing address.
The plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.
According to Hutchins's lawsuit, ATS (and its predecessor, Northern Funding) are real-estate lending subsidiaries of Northern Leasing Systems Inc., a company that the New York attorney general sued last year, alleging it engages fraudulent and deceptive practices that trap small business owners across the country.
One fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.
Instead, in January of last year, ATS used the alleged nonpayment of the mortgages as a pretext for declaring a default and very aggressively threatening . . .foreclosure, the lawsuit alleges.
Here, Sanders cites a newspaper clip of Biden in a debate with a Republican challenger. The solvency of Social Security was considered an urgent issue at the time, given the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, and Republicans promoted ideas such as allowing Americans to divert Social Security moneys into private investment accounts. Biden's challenger supported that idea. In the debate, Biden countered that there were less dramatic ways to find savings in Social Security such as reducing the interest rate to calculate cost of living benefits or boosting the retirement age by a year.
The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.
It was like a shot to the heart, Guerrero said.
Taylor got his wish, but lost to Luria in November.
In the end, owners who do their homework and conduct a thorough analysis of their options will make a better decision.
Historians Jonathan White and Scott Sandage, who recently rediscovered a letter discussing the memorial written by Douglass, accurately characterized Douglass's real proposal, which was not to remove the memorial . . . nor to replace it but to supplement it with other works of art that would tell a more complete story.
The good news for Republicans is that few parts of the country are as inhospitable to a Trump-era GOP during a shutdown as Northern Virginia. The bad news for them: It's hard to take the party seriously when it says Sen. Mark Warner will face a serious challenge in 2020.
The pinch might be the sharpest in smaller countries where people rely on dollars for day-to-day banking and saving. For instance, Jamaica's government has issued debts in U.S. dollars worth nearly two-thirds of the island's GDP.
This year, Democrats considered Virginia part of the Mid-Atlantic region with the District, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, which meant Wexton had to compete with more seasoned members from states with more Democratic members.
On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his Game of Thrones-style poster saying, The Wall is Coming.
Who wants to be a billionaire? Tom Steyer is not running for president, focusing his time and money — at least $40 million of it — on the ongoing effort to impeach the president.
Harris's book and its accompanying tour present a politician who was counted out in every election until 2016, when she won her Senate race in a rout. There is no setback that she doesn't overcome, from a failed attempt to pass the bar (she passed it the second time) to an apparent defeat in her 2010 attorney general run (late-counted ballots gave her the win). Like Barack Obama, and like a younger cohort of first-generation American politicians, she describes a family of smart strivers who struggled so that she could succeed — and learn valuable lessons.
Some experts say the plan would penalize foreign economies that sell products to the United States. Under the GOP plan for a border adjustment, U.S. firms would no longer be allowed to exempt the cost of their imports from taxation. On paper, this provision amounts to a new tax on imports, which would negatively affect workers around the world whose livelihoods depend on U.S. consumption.
A spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.
●Hire help if you must. If you don't have time to follow the steps above, you can hire help. Some real estate lawyers take property tax appeals on a contingency basis, which means you don't pay unless you win. If you prevail, a typical fee is one-third to one-half of the first year's savings.
Trump rejected that deal, and here we are.
Dear Readers: If you have pins and needles that don't glide through fabrics anymore, you can fix that!
It doesn't have to be that way, though. There's nothing inevitable about recessions. Australia hasn't had one since 1991, and we don't have to have one in 2020, as markets seem to think we will, if we make the right choices.
●Escalate as needed. Some property tax disputes can be settled through informal discussions with the assessor's office. For example, Fairfax County, Va., encourages homeowners to call. More commonly, you will be asked to fill out forms and the entire process will be done on paper. If your initial appeal fails, most jurisdictions offer an in-person hearing as the next step. Tip: Attend somebody else's hearing first to get a feel for the process.
— House lawmakers are planning to introduce a bipartisan gun-control measure on Tuesday, an effort led by Pelosi, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).
Now that we have the chance to take on President Trump directly, now that he's on the ballot, you're going to see that continue to grow, Sinovic said.
Revenue generated by the men's and women's competitions is complicated because FIFA bundles such things as TV rights and sponsorship deals.
Official pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.
The first doctorate in education was awarded in 1921 by Harvard. The first doctor of philosophy degree in the field of education was awarded in 1893 by Teachers College of Columbia, and has since been offered by hundreds of universities. As with any degree that stresses a research background, most schools required a dissertation and qualifying exams.
Molina, however, said that since the money hasn't been appropriated yet, he fears that Congress could stop funding the cost-sharing reductions as early as May.
Sanders here cites a news story (actually by the Associated Press but on the NBC News website) from when Biden was running for president, titled Biden unveils plan to protect retirement savings. The article is mostly about his plan to bolster retirement savings but adds:
While the Trump reelection campaign is on air and online with ads, multiple Democratic candidates are buying digital spots, blasting out fundraising letters and Periscoping some takes about the shutdown that are building their lists and brands.
Here are a few of the common expenses/costs overlooked by sellers:
Last year, Leggett's budget included an 8.7 percent boost in the average residential tax bill — the largest since 2008 — citing the needs of the fast-growing school system and revenue losses triggered when the Supreme Court ruled that Maryland's income-tax system was unconstitutional. He later trimmed the proposed increase to about 6 percent, but the County Council, which has the final say on budget matters, added new spending and ultimately approved a boost of nearly 9 percent.
Sanders, who said he hadn't known about the settlement, had previously said he was unaware of the other harassment allegations. Today's statement was informed by the response Sanders gave at the end of a recent CNN interview, in which he reiterated that he condemned harassment and added that he was a little bit busy running around the country and never heard of the allegations at the time.
Daniel Carey, Virginia's secretary of health and human resources, said that given the limited number of tests available, it makes sense for doctors to first test patients for flu, pneumonia or bacterial infections to rule out those conditions.
—One day after retaking the majority in the House, Democratic lawmakers took an initial step toward intervening in a case in which U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.
A few countries are especially vulnerable. Among large developing countries, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia all have outstanding debts in dollars equivalent to roughly a quarter of their gross domestic product, according to a report from Fitch, the ratings agency. Mexico and Russia are also at risk, with dollar-denominated debts worth about one sixth of GDP.
We are moving to a global business services platform for our more transactional and standard work, Henry said Tuesday. And when you do that, when you think about it, we are removing a role that is in country, so we are paying the full severance on that position that we are taking out, and we are hiring that role in a different location in our shared services center.
If 2008 was the Great Financial Crisis, this is the Great Virus Crisis, said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. It's all at once a health crisis, financial crisis and economic crisis. We need to fix the health part of it before we have it solved, but we can take financial and fiscal steps to blunt its effects. We are starting to do that now.

He said the suspension of operations at the convention center and other facilities will affect three Capital City Go-Go basketball games, a circus and the finish line and expo associated with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon.
The measure, which the House passed in 2016, faces an additional vote in that chamber before being taken up in the Senate, where it failed last year. The legislation is sponsored by Del. Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore). It would ensure a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours of work, up to seven full days per year.
Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.
But he also sought to keep a lid on some hot-button bills after they consumed the 2012 legislative session. Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), one of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, often complained that Howell had some of his bills quietly killed off in committees to avoid controversy. An example of that this year was Marshall's ill-fated measure to require transgender people to use the public bathroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificates.
We're going to go into a period of severe and extensive credit shock across many regions, sectors and asset classes, she said. This is unprecedented.
The horse-trading and cajoling to land a committee assignment starts right after the election, aides said.
Harris started her political career as a newsmaking opponent of capital punishment and is now accused by the left, pejoratively, of being a cop. That was never an issue in her California races; it will be an issue for plenty of Democratic voters in 2019. A senator whose smart-on-crime brand enabled her rise out of Bay Area politics is angling for the nomination to challenge President Trump, a politician who comes alive when attacking her community's support for undocumented immigrants, gun control and the Black Lives Matter movement.
She described herself as pro-choice on abortion rights and – asked if she considers herself a feminist – said, My mother always told me to do my best, to think my best and to do right, and to consider myself a person. Women's rights groups expressed delight with the selection of a woman who Women's Legal Defense Fund President Judith L. Lichtman described as a stellar attorney with an extraordinary track record. The lesson of the agonizing nomination process, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, is that there are superb women as well as men who can serve the country with distinction and having someone like Janet Reno in charge of the Justice Department is a wonderful step forward. But the American Family Association of Florida, a conservative Christian group, said it would oppose Reno's nomination because of what it called her deplorable record on prosecuting pornography cases. Since Reno took office, said organization President David Caton, Dade County has become stomping grounds for pornographers. In turning to Reno, Clinton departed from the practice of most presidents who choose either close advisers or nationally known figures. Clinton said he settled on Reno – whose extensive criminal law background also distinguishes her – because he wanted someone with management as well as legal experience, and who had dealt with a wide range of real-world problems. He said he had known of Reno for some time because his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham is a public defender in the drug court that Reno established.
So Levine set out to build a tool that would provide some quick and reliable answers. On Wednesday, Yale University and 15 other schools announced that they would use a version of his calculator now known as MyinTuition. (Get it?) That brought the total involved in his nonprofit initiative to 31, including Wellesley, which in 2013 became the first to use Levine's calculator.
Even the prospect of roughly $1 trillion in emergency federal aid, including $1,000 checks for taxpayers and an airline industry bailout, was not enough to halt the retreat. Dire predictions about the global pandemic's spread and its likely economic toll discouraged traders.
Rampell's words serve as a reminder that, though an educator such as Jill Biden, a woman with a doctorate, and Greco, a man with a passion for teaching, may not be able to minister to a heart attack victim on a flight from New York to Los Angeles, they provide the resources for those who can and do. No one makes it through life without teachers, many of whom save just as many if not more lives than the doctor on the plane. Thanks for reminding us.
Officials say there was a low risk of exposure for people who attended the conference, because the patients did not show symptoms during the conference, said Gregory A. O'Dell, president and chief executive of Events D.C.
●Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott, the longest-serving member of the delegation from either party, is chairman of the Education Committee.
In 2007, Joe Biden appeared on Meet the Press to say that Social Security and Medicare cuts should be 'on the table.'
The White House proposed annual budgets slashing the Education Department's funding, and DeVos defended them on Capitol Hill, although Congress — even when controlled by Republicans — rejected the cuts.
Before the emergency declaration, the owner of the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals said their games would go on as scheduled at Capital One Arena in the District's Chinatown neighborhood.
This is not the first lawsuit filed by a consumer who alleges being misled into thinking that a product made by a large company is in fact produced by an artisan brewery or distillery, and it certainly won't be the last. The problem is that the track record of these lawsuits isn't very good. Last June, for example, a federal judge dismissed a case brought by a California beer lover who claimed that Blue Moon, which is owned by Coors, was marketing itself as a craft beer produced by the Blue Moon Brewing Company. The judge found that a reasonable consumer was not likely to be deceived by Blue Moon's packaging or website.
Can we talk about the children's book? Harris said, picking up a copy of Superheroes Are Everywhere, which she published alongside her memoir this week. Mama didn't raise no fool.
Mark Dunn, associate director of admissions at Yale, said the university hopes the MyinTuition calculator will fill an information gap about college expenses. Like many other highly selective schools, Yale promises prospective students that it will meet their financial need. But Dunn acknowledged that many remain skeptical. Our sense is that until you can actually see what a need-based financial aid award would mean for your family, it's hard to honestly believe what colleges say, Dunn said. He said Yale plans to promote the MyinTuition calculator prominently as it begins outreach in coming weeks to high school juniors who would enter in 2019.
Those figures dwarf the totals for other major global currencies. Debt denominated in euros totals just $2.8 trillion outside the euro area, and loans in yen amount to just $440 billion outside of Japan.
The Dec. 29 Style article How op-eds sparked outrage all year long raised some interesting questions. Should the goal of an op-ed be inducing outrage? Are only national op-eds of importance? What happens to our democracy if we rely only on a few media sources — no matter how good — for news and commentary?
These measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
The council will review Leggett's proposal and pass a final budget in May.
Yields on Italian debt rose to 2.3 percent, roughly twice what they were less than one week ago.
Montgomery County residents socked with a hefty property tax hike last year would get a reprieve from further increases this year under the operating budget proposed Tuesday by County Executive Isiah Leggett (D).
DeVos was also a fierce critic of the Obama administration's consumer regulations, accusing her predecessor of putting taxpayers at risk with policies that made it too easy for college students to shirk their financial responsibilities. She once complained that all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.
I have a budget for the campaign we're going to run between Iowa and New Hampshire, and my personal funds will make up for any shortfalls, Delaney said in an interview as he headed to weekend events in Michigan and Iowa. It may end up being about 50-50. Raising money creates a connection to the campaign; what gets you out of bed is the fact that people have invested in you.
How the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.
While the state of Maryland has the direct responsibility of providing Metro with its annual subsidy, local officials in counties and cities Metro serves can provide responses to state transportation officials.
The Secret Service's protective intelligence division then runs those names through a national FBI database to determine whether anyone is wanted for a bench warrant or has any history of arrests or convictions for drugs or violent crimes.
Booker was greeted by enthusiastic crowds when he made his first trip to Iowa in early October for the Democratic Party gala. His visit included standing-room-only turnout at an event advertised as a discussion on agricultural issues and hosted in the Boone County Democratic offices.

Kirsten Gillibrand. Per the AP, she is considering basing a presidential campaign in Upstate New York, where her political career began.
Once homeowners factor in all of these costs, the rental option often turns from a roughly break-even scenario to one that generates a deficit each month. This puts additional pressure on the capital appreciation required to make the rental option a sound choice. In other words, the capital appreciation has to more than compensate for the monthly deficit. In a flat or down market, the rental option can be financially devastating.
The reversal came as the Trump administration tries to rapidly get stimulus payments out to Americans in the face of the quickest economic decline in modern history.
As the coronavirus continues to spread, phrases like quarantine, isolation and social distancing are making news. Here are the key differences of each. (The Washington Post)

Howell's relationship with McAuliffe (D) has been strained, despite their shared history as dealmakers and McAuliffe's efforts to woo the speaker over craft beer in the Executive Mansion.
Leeds said she supports the Anthem's decision to cancel events. It's important to follow the guidance of the city and what's best for people's safety, she said.
— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.
But Metro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said the agency needs to consider the financial health of cities and counties across the Washington region as it moves forward with its own needs.
A man was shot and critically wounded Wednesday morning when at least one gunman opened fire on a vehicle on Wheeler Road in Southeast Washington, D.C. police said.
Unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had to be drafted into her 2012 run for Senate, and unlike John Delaney, who jump-started a presidential campaign with no speculation or buzz, Harris has been seen as a potential president for most of her time in public life. As early as 2010, when she was a slight underdog in the race for California attorney general, Harris was described as a female Obama.
The calculator cautions consumers that a detailed analysis of family finances could produce a considerably different result. It points them to the net price calculator to get more information. Levine said financial circumstances can be especially tricky for students from divorced families. But he noted that retirement savings are not included in the formula. The calculator only asks about retirement savings to ensure that families don't include that sort of funding when they seek aid estimates.
Until late last month, Metro officials were staring down a looming deficit of nearly $671 million starting in March because of ridership losses. The transit agency had proposed severe service cuts that included no weekend rail service until Congress came through with a $900 billion stimulus in late December that included $14 billion for transit.
I am a great fan of Catherine Rampell's columns and loved her Dec. 25 op-ed celebrating her sixth-grade teacher, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. Like Rampell, I am the beneficiary of many excellent teachers who changed my life enormously. I am also the husband and father of teachers. I particularly enjoyed Rampell's phrase about her teacher instructing her about the masonry of language. Lovely piece.
The Times noted at the time that Trump had suffered only defeats in advancing the project, writing that Trump does not so much avoid failure as know how to land on his feet and change course so deftly that no one catches on.
The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.
During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border — including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.
During the last recession, when the U.S. government sent most Americans a stimulus check and required a filed tax return to get it, 3.5 million Social Security recipients were left out because they never sent a return, according to a 2008 Treasury Department analysis.
Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump would take a concrete wall off the table in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.
Torres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.
Again and again, The Post's coverage of women's sports is disproportionately — and discriminatingly — less than that of men's sports.
Now, Geary works at Cerner, a global health-care technology company, where his decades of experience navigating the medical system inform his work as a data analyst. He said he's happier than he has ever been.
Democracy protests do not tend to spread, we argue, because they are about domestic issues that are generally unrelated to what is happening in other countries. Democracy protests tend to arise when elections, economic crises and other events within the country focus the public's existing anger about political, social or economic grievances, prompting collective action.
Metro has annually asked for as much as it can because officials say expenses have risen at least 8 percent annually in recent years, outpacing mostly flat fare revenue growth. The transit system felt so stretched that it had lobbied the states to increase or alter the cap before the pandemic struck.
If you're thinking of going down this road, the first thing you should do is to identify and acknowledge your emotional reasons for selling. What we typically hear is that homeowners didn't get the sale price they wanted so they consider renting out the property for a while as a placeholder so they can wait for the market to bounce back. This logic often has less to do with the actual costs/benefits of renting, but rather the emotional burden of selling at a perceived loss.
But the administration — represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner — refused, according to multiple officials.
I think this bill will change the dialogue in 2020, said Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.). We'll see candidates, much more quickly after declaring, release their tax returns. I think they'll take a lot more questions about this on the campaign trail, and I think a lot more voters will be asking, 'What's your position on this?'
In many cases, it may be better for the homeowner simply to lower the sale price.
Mulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) apologized on Jan. 10 to women who alleged they were sexually harassed or mistreated by male members of his 2016 campaign staff. (Reuters)
Perhaps the authors of Wednesday's revolt already regret their role in goading the mob. Now that the Democrats have taken the Senate, they are likely to press for federal election reform, a proposition that's anathema to the right. As political scientist Sam Rosenfeld describes it, some Republicans understand that they benefit more in the long term from legal anti-democratic institutions than from dubiously legal anti-democratic actions, which are more set-piece theatrical statements than carefully planned strategies.
The New York lawsuit involves allegations of leasing of credit card equipment with terms that are onerous and totally one-sided in favor of Northern Leasing, according to a press release from New York attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman. When a small business tries to cancel the contract or stop paying, Northern Leasing will send threatening letters and commence collection actions in New York Civil Court, the release alleges. The attorney general's office claims Northern Leasing and its related companies filed more than 30,000 collection actions between 2010 and 2015 and obtained more than 19,000 default judgments, often because the businesses weren't aware of the action.
There are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.
Some analysts said concern over Washington's unprecedented spending plans, which will balloon the already swollen federal budget deficit and debt, were behind the latest moves.
European markets also tanked Wednesday as governments introduced sweeping, blank-check stimulus moves to prop up their economies, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index closing down more than 4 percent as oil and gas stocks plunged. Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom have hurled hundreds of billions in rescue package funding at the virus. French President Emmanuel Macron went so far as to promise that no French company will be allowed to fail because of the coronavirus impact, saying the government would provide assistance through loans or delayed tax payments and even nationalize industries to keep them afloat.
Joe Biden is the Hillary Clinton of 2020, by Matthew Yglesias
During a Senate floor speech over the GOP plan for a balanced budget calling for reducing Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years, Biden said, You guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO [Congressional Budget Office] numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.''
The proposal will call for universal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, our colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.
But this time, the prop revolvers were loaded with live bullets, and half the audience thought the drama was real. Hawley's decision to challenge the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory transformed the process into a farce, in which Cruz and other Republican senators promised to outdo one another's displays of loyalty to President Trump — until a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol. Their gambit was too jaundiced even for Mitch McConnell (whose biographer dubbed him The Cynic); the majority leader exhorted senators to respect the people's choice and not rely on others to do the right thing.
Research shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms' bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 28 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.
DeVos has said she regrets not pushing the issue harder earlier in Trump's term, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. Her best chance was probably in a sweeping tax bill, signed in 2017, but the White House did not include school choice proposals even in its blueprint for the bill.
I think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
According to the National Taxpayers Union, less than 5 percent of homeowners do what the Greens did, even though the union estimates that between 30 and 60 percent of properties in the United States are over-assessed. The vast majority of assessors are not malicious or careless; they are simply making judgment calls about how to utilize limited resources in tackling a big job, said Pete Sepp, the union's president. Homeowners shouldn't take it personally, but they shouldn't assume the government is right, either. Sepp says that when well-prepared homeowners take the time to appeal, most win at least a partial victory. Here's how to improve your chances of being one of the winners:
The party will hold a caucus May 11 and May 13 to select a nominee for the November general election. The candidates are Erik Gutshall, a business owner; Peter Fallon, a tax accountant; Kim Klingler, an emergency medical technician; and Vivek Patil, a biotech professional.
Her signature proposal would have created a type of federal school voucher program, in which donations to state scholarship programs would be reimbursed in the form of federal tax credits. It garnered GOP support in Congress but was opposed by Democrats, who control the House, and some Republicans.

The Dec. 30 editorial A bad stimulus idea said of the recently passed coronavirus relief bill, In short, the measure short-shrifted the neediest and showered billions on people who suffered little or no lasting hardship from the pandemic. I take no issue with the argument, but the writers probably meant the bill shortchanged the neediest, as in gave too little money to.
Howell has primarily focused on promoting business-friendly policies. And he has been willing to cut deals to get things done — sometimes to the chagrin of more ideologically driven Republicans.
But while this was a defining political moment for Harris, Feinstein appears in The Truths We Hold only once, in a fond memory Harris has of driving across the bridge from my home in Oakland to celebrate when Feinstein and Barbara Boxer became California's first female senators. The debates over the death penalty, which nearly cost her the 2010 race, come up only when Harris recalls how one strategist (never named) said a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco could not win statewide office.

McConnell was right. The two main protagonists knew they were playacting. Hawley and Cruz graduated from top universities and law schools and clerkships. They know what the Constitution says and how elections work. Even before Wednesday, they understood that their maneuvers wouldn't actually overturn the 2020 results, so there would be no real consequences. (As a senior Republican said of the president's election fraud fantasies in November, What is the downside for humoring him?) Supposedly, the institutions of American democracy would hold, and they'd get to put on a show to further their presidential ambitions by encouraging a popular delusion on the right.
OUCH: The Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarette start-up Juul and Altria, the country's largest cigarette maker, are going back on their pledges to combat youth vaping, an issue that's become a critical focus for commissioner Gottlieb.
Restaurateurs such as Jamie Leeds, the chef-owner of Hank's Oyster Bar, were bracing for a significant drop in customers, especially in neighborhoods anchored by large event spaces.
That's the trade-off, said Steve Stombres, who was chief of staff to Eric Cantor during Cantor's tenure as House majority leader and is now a consultant.
The decision to shut down immediately affected Satellite 2020, an annual technology convention that has been held in the District for 39 years. The convention started Monday, was scheduled to end Thursday, and was expected to draw more than 15,000 attendees from more than 100 countries, organizers said.
Part of that has come from eliminating certain full-time service positions while hiring elsewhere.
Why re-litigate 40-year-old news articles and four-year-old news conferences? Because it's worth remembering that Trump at no time was prepared to manage the process of passing legislation through the House and the Senate. The current government shutdown, approaching three weeks in length, stemmed from dual failures on Trump's part: Most recently in an inability to cajole members of Congress to see his side on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico and, earlier, a failure to passing a funding mechanism for that wall during the two years when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.
The transit agency can legally ask for up to a 3 percent yearly increase from the state of Maryland and cities and counties of Virginia that, along with D.C., provide Metro with the bulk of its annual operating budget. Metro has asked for the increase each year since the cap was passed two years ago, but this year, transit officials say they are cognizant of the financial constraints the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked on tax revenue that regional governments depend on.
Along with many of its peers in the retail industry Kimberly-Clark has been buffeted for years by falling commodity prices. The company's revenue rose by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period a year earlier, but the numbers are down significantly from 2014. Profits rose by 21 percent, or $1.75 a share for the quarter.
Tax records show Berhalter, a former MLS coach, received a $200,000 signing bonus upon accepting the offer in fall 2018, plus $104,113 in salary and moving expenses after starting the job in December.
Maryland's House of Delegates on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to a bill that would require businesses with 15 or more workers to provide paid sick leave.
An increase in the local subsidy at this time would be another expense on Fairfax County residents, he said in a statement.
Again, Sanders frames this as an effort only about Social Security, but it was much broader — aimed at every part of government, including defense.
— Politico's Dan Diamond spoke with Chris Meekins, who left HHS last week after helping oversee migrant family reunifications. Meekins called the family separation policy headed by the Department of Homeland Security an ill-fated policy that was devised by Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. I think that it's unconscionable to do it in this way, Meekins said. Listen to the podcast here.
The 2018 records also show full-time players on the women's team received about $170,000 in base salary (for playing for both the U.S. squad and a National Women's Soccer League team) and up to $146,000 in bonuses, tied to appearances, performance incentives and qualifying for the World Cup.
As a former middle school English teacher, I often wonder about my students and the memories we carved out together. I wonder about the youngster whose profound and self-conscious stuttering made his ability to participate an impossibility for fear of exposure. I remember how writing poetry liberated him by providing the perfect platform for sharing his debilitating struggle with his classmates and providing them with a lesson in humanity and sensitivity.
[How to figure out the value of your home]
D.C. government shuts down for Emancipation Day, although the federal government and most businesses in the city remain open. In 2000, then-D.C. Council member Vincent B. Orange Sr. (D-Ward 5) prepared legislation — which the council passed unanimously and then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) signed — declaring April 16 D.C. Emancipation Day, a legal private holiday. The day was officially observed for the first time as a public holiday, one that closed the city government, in 2005.
Trump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.
House Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.
When much of the action is grass-roots and outside the Beltway, we need the ideas and analysis that commentary pieces in the regional and local newspapers provide to help us better understand what's going on around the nation and in local communities and to find solutions. Politicians, even when they're in Washington, rely on their local papers to keep on top of their constituents' concerns. Providing a platform for reasoned exchanges of ideas at the national, regional and local levels helps build consensus on policy concerns — and bring us together.
Independent Audrey Clement is also running.
Finally, the republic's guardians should recognize that the fight to secure democracy isn't over just because the mob has been evicted from the Capitol. The processes that allow democracy to work (vote counting, redistricting, early voting, identification procedures and voter registration) seem very boring to the public in the years between major elections. But we can go back to enjoying the political performances — and shrugging when the players ham it up — only if everyone knows it's a play, and the machinery behind the curtain is strong.
Widespread delusion can have bitter consequences, as we saw Wednesday, when amateur dramatics led a misinformed audience to storm the stage. Cameron's mistakes meant that the country he led dropped out of Europe and is at greater risk of breaking apart. Cruz and Hawley's not only helped provoke a mob but could also make American democracy unworkable, as everyone starts challenging every result they don't like. Politicians can't rely on political institutions to save the country from the consequences of their playacting, because the institutions aren't outside the politicians, and the politicians aren't outside the institutions.
If someone calls you on the phone and claims be an IRS agent, ask the following questions: the person's name, badge number, callback number and the number he or she is calling from, if possible. If the caller is not an IRS employee, he or she will probably hang up.
Later, the National Basketball Association announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.
Of course, the other actors in Cameron's drama didn't stick to his script. Britons voted for Brexit by a narrow majority, transforming the United Kingdom into a fundamentally different country and threatening the union of its four nations.
●Rep. Don Beyer will be seated on the Ways and Means Committee, ending Virginia's more than 20-year drought. The panel sets tax policy and will play a role in any infrastructure bill that materializes.
In contrast, the women's basketball team received 12 inches of column space — starting on Page 5 — without a photograph, even though it won an outstanding game (96-82, against Penn State) in which Ashley Owusu scored a career-high 34 points. The highest-scoring men's player netted 19 points.
Given that a lot of developing countries hold debt denominated in the U.S. dollar, that would essentially increase their debt burden, said Robbie Silverman, a senior adviser at Oxfam. To make good on their debts, he added, foreign governments would have to spend more buying up dollars, leaving less money infrastructure, public health, education and other investments that can help poor countries prosper.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.
She said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers.
When April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, a return is considered timely filed if it is filed on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, IRS spokesman Ubon Mendie said in an email last year. The term 'legal holiday' includes a legal holiday observed in the District of Columbia.
Nick Guerrero of Mesa, Ariz., has learned that he's one of those who won't be getting any money because he's 18, another blow to his senior year of high school that is quickly unraveling.
Trump will note (and has noted) that the existence of the filibuster makes passing legislation trickier than bare majorities might make it seem. And that's fair — but it also means that Trump at no point was able to use those zoning-board skills to persuade even eight Democrats to join his view of an issue. At one point, a deal seemed to be in the works with the Democratic minority, trading wall money for the protection of immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.
Members are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: The Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.
Committee assignments for the five freshmen have not yet been determined.

I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club, Morales said in an interview Thursday.
After growing without interruption since mid-2009, the U.S. economy will likely shrink in the second quarter at an annual rate of 14 percent — a staggering decline that exceeds the worst of the global financial crisis, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase. A sudden stop that began in China, where the virus originated, is now rippling through the U.S., Europe and vulnerable emerging markets, likely shrinking global output for the entire year.
In general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said.
Still, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.
Mission not quite accomplished, by Brendan James
The lack of a photograph with the op-ed ironically underscored the very problem that the piece complained about: the failure to see Black women, to hear Black women and to listen to Black women, particularly when they are suffering.
A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the right answer, worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.
The company has seen some initial success expanding to new markets, with sales in its personal care segment up by wide margins in Latin America, China and Eastern Europe.
I have too many memories of my brilliant mother being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent, Harris writes of her India-born mother, Shyamala, who died of cancer in 2009. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or blouse she had chosen.
A member of the House since 1988, Howell was one of four delegates to start a prayer group that still meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday during the session. He has been a conservative on social issues such as abortion.
Meanwhile, the Dow's plunge from its all-time high of 29,551 on Feb. 12 has eliminated one of the president's favorite campaign arguments. As stocks soared since the 2016 election, Trump repeatedly took credit at campaign rallies and in White House remarks. He drew attention to the market setting all-time highs and boasted about the effect on voters' investment accounts.
Even before it was officially announced, Howell's plan to retire at the end of his term in January set off a competition between two delegates to replace him at the helm of the overwhelmingly GOP-majority chamber.
The bill would preserve much of the status quo until 2020, when the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance to consumers would be replaced by age-based tax credits.
Rep. John Delaney (Md.), the first Democrat to enter the presidential race, has an estimated net worth over $200 million, and spent millions to win a seat in Congress in 2012. But he has run his campaign so far with mixture of personal funds and donations.
The holiday is marked by a parade in which city leaders and schoolchildren march along Pennsylvania Avenue. This year, the rest of the country also might learn about the District holiday.
After her first stop in Iowa last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said every Democratic candidate ought to link arms and say, 'We're going to do this with grass-roots funding.'  To Warren, that also meant that independently wealthy candidates should not write their own campaign checks.
Deemed the accidental speaker because he assumed the role in January 2003 after S. Vance Wilkins resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal, Howell instituted a number of reforms, including bringing some strictness and objectivity to rules governing what can be ruled in and out of order.
Wiedefeld proposed that Metro would seek to work with unions to defer raises and enact service cuts in the last six months, leaving the agency with a $171.4 million deficit. Officials previously have said they might seek more federal assistance at that time to bridge the gap unless ridership rebounds.
Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.
It's a move that could bring the health-care law all the way to the Supreme Court for a third time, Amy writes.
P.S. Don't forget to sign your income-tax form and check the math. Thousands of people make these mistakes each year.
As Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) gave a speech in Ankeny during her pre-election Iowa tour, she was greeted by a shout: Run for president! When she spoke in Iowa City and Des Moines, she filled rooms holding about 500 people.
5. At the presidential debate, Biden inspires his supporters by appearing, most of the time, to be fully aware that he is participating in a debate.
Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.
In 1984, Joe Biden first pushed to freeze funding for Social Security — which would end up cutting Social Security benefits.
Executives have tried to fill the gap through a cost-cutting program it calls FORCE, or Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere, which is meant to make its factories and distribution lines more efficient. Executives told analysts the company has saved about $450 million in the past year as part of that program, as part of a planned $1.5 billion cost-reduction over the next four years.
Beyond the tax-filing hurdle, millions of other Americans are realizing that they don't qualify for a coronavirus relief check.
Trump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately.
The good news, then, is that — as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell took pains to emphasize on Friday —this is exactly what they intend to do. If things do indeed get bumpy over the next few months, the Fed is perfectly willing to put its rate-hiking plans on hold, and even stop its bond holdings from shrinking any further. Which are real possibilities. See, while it's easy to make fun of the stock market for, as the old saying goes, predicting nine out of the last five recessions, it's important to understand that part of the reason it has so many false positives is that it often prompts policymakers to act before things get worse. So both we and the Fed should take it seriously, especially when the much less erratic bond market is telling the same story. Indeed, the fact that long-term interest rates are very close to being lower than short-term interest rates is its way of saying that it thinks the Fed is going to have start cutting rates soon — which it would do only to fight a recession.
He used the committee to fund the Baker-Hamilton Commission to study the war in Iraq and secure money to combat the transnational gang MS-13, among other priorities.
On Sunday night, Guerrero was video chatting with a dozen friends and they laughed at the thought of having to hold a virtual prom and getting their high school diplomas via email. It still seemed unreal. On Monday, they woke up to the news that school was canceled for the rest of the year in Arizona.
As late as Feb. 24, the president took to Twitter to talk up stock prices, tweeting: Stock market starting to look very good to me.
Helping to channel some of this Democratic enthusiasm are organizations like Siouxland Progressive Women, one of thousands of groups that have cropped up on the left since the 2016 election.
Between Arena's departure and Berhalter's appointment, interim coach Dave Sarachan made about $240,000 from January through November 2018, tax records show.
Of course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.
Insurers wanted the health insurance tax repealed. Drug companies wanted the prescription drug tax repealed. Medical device makers wanted to kill an excise tax. Big employers wanted to abolish the Cadillac tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health plans. With the exception of the Cadillac tax — which was previously delayed to 2020 and now will be been delayed to 2025 — they all got what they wanted.
Tulsi Gabbard. The House member got on the wrong side of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono from her state of Hawaii for agreeing with a conservative attack on them — that they engaged in religious bigotry by questioning a judicial nominee about membership in the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus.
To be fair, Harris has written a book (Smart on Crime) about her criminal justice record and agenda. The part of that she focuses the most on in The Truths We Hold is her Back on Track program, an innovation of the San Francisco's DA office that allowed first-time nonviolent drug offenders to get job training in lieu of jail time. The book's focus when addressing her six years as attorney general is a showdown with banks over what would become a $25 billion foreclosure settlement. The story of her phone call to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is destined to be retold in Iowa and New Hampshire: I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.
The Iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the White House is tangible among Democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. The throngs of voters bombarding events in Iowa are testament to something fearful for Republicans: The huge tide of Democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.
OOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.
If we are witnessing a yellow vest wave, it is not a wave of unified protests; rather, it is a spread of the symbols.
Unemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.
A class-action complaint filed in the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Matthew Adam and all others similarly situated, alleges that Walmart used a fraudulent, unlawful, deceptive and unfair course of conduct to market and sell its four Trouble Brewing beers as craft beers, and because of this, Members of the public were fraudulently induced to purchase Defendant's Craft Beer at inflated prices.
DeVos quickly proved herself an ally of for-profit colleges by withdrawing, delaying or announcing plans to revamp more than a half-dozen Obama-era measures that affected the industry, all within her first year. The secretary tapped former for-profit college executives to marshal higher-education policies that critics say gave predatory schools a pass.
In Azerbaijan, about 80 percent of deposits are in dollars, according to Fitch. If the dollar becomes more expensive, it could be more difficult for Azerbaijani banks to pay out those deposits.
Amid unpredictable day-to-day changes in market conditions, former Fed Chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke called for the central bank to begin purchasing high-quality corporate debt as part of its economic rescue efforts — something it has never before done.
There are promising signs out of the Trump administration, Welch said. I think there is a significant potential Trump is going to step up on prescription drug pricing.
Biden pitched it as the last best chance to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.
What is most maddening is that better alternatives exist, including some being developed by the business community that would target resources to the workers most in need without a vast new bureaucracy. They also have the advantage of being able to be implemented far sooner than the 2020 start envisioned under the council's bill.
We've seen massive jumps, said Matt Sinovic, the group's executive director. Online donations are also up, he said.
Friday, February 12, 1993; Page A01 President Clinton yesterday named veteran Miami prosecutor Janet Reno to be his attorney general, selecting a woman he described as a front-line crime fighter of unquestioned integrity to fill the vacancy that has plagued the first three weeks of his administration. Announcing his nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said his selection had been guided somewhat, but not entirely by the desire to name the first female attorney general. Clinton said the position was not set aside for a woman and that he seriously considered at least four men for the job. But he said that he thought it would be a good and an interesting thing to do to name a woman to the position and said that if he had it to do over again, I would have called Janet Reno on November the 5th. In December, Clinton nominated corporate lawyer Zoe E. Baird, who was forced to withdraw because she had violated immigration and tax laws in hiring illegal immigrants. He was poised to name federal judge Kimba M. Wood before she withdrew last week after the disclosure that she had also employed an illegal immigrant to care for her child. Reno, who is not married and has no children, said, I've never hired an illegal alien and I think I've paid all my Social Security taxes, adding with a smile, Certainly in the vetting process in the last week, we've covered everything.
The crowds coming out are eager to engage. In Sioux City, when Warren told the audience there that she couldn't do anything about Trump's insults, Glenda Verhoeven, a 63-year-old farmer, shouted, Yes, you can!
I have really enjoyed serving in this esteemed body, Howell said. It has truly been the greatest professional honor of my life.
4. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris's criticisms: Joe has forgotten all about that. Literally.
Progress Iowa drew about 150 people to its 2014 meeting that featured Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Last month's attendance doubled even though the roster included lesser-known potential candidates such as Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
At one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said. She said she could not recall exactly when that occurred.
Prince George's County Council member Todd M. Turner (D-District 4), who also is a member of the Washington Suburban Transit Commission, said a lower subsidy request should be welcomed by state legislators.
Biden was challenged by host Tim Russert on the growing budget deficit, and he indicated a willingness to bargain if a lasting deal could be reached.
You are truly a historic figure in this chamber and in this Capitol, said Toscano, adding that the speaker is akin to a judge. The good judges are the ones who let you try your case. . . . You let us try our cases, and we thank you for that.
The state's public lab has testing supplies for 300 to 400 patients, and it anticipates receiving additional tests soon to increase that capacity to 600. Until testing capacity increases, health department officials will give priority to people who have had contact with others with confirmed cases, who have traveled to impacted areas and who live in nursing homes.
3. The campaign focuses on finding a running mate who has a name that Joe can remember.
An edifice to an edifying educator
DeVos advocates for a light touch from the federal government when it comes to education, and she shrunk the size of the Education Department workforce by 11 percent, as of June, declining to fill positions. She seemed more comfortable leaning down to talk with children on school visits than interacting with official Washington.
Most small businesses don't have the legal muscle to fight back. This isn't free. You have to go to court to oppose it. It's very costly, Kmt says. This is like a legal hit and run. They ran us off the road, and we have to chase the ambulance back down.
House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (Colonial Heights) and Del. Terry G. Kilgore (Scott) worked quietly over the past week to line up support for their rival bids to replace Howell (Stafford), according to two Republicans familiar with their efforts. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal caucus matters.
Defending Democracy, a group of Republicans working to recruit a challenger to the president, is going on the air in New Hampshire to urge the GOP against altering rules that would stop that effort.
So funny we forgot to laugh
The partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:
Misperceptions about price matter hugely, Levine said. This whole issue is about social mobility, he said. Here you have opportunities where kids are qualified to go to high-level institutions, and don't because they don't understand the price. That's a huge failure.
But it may make sense for homeowners to pull the house off the market and rent it out if they are moving away for a relatively short term but will return to the area; or if they have a long-term time horizon for holding the property as a rental, have built a financial model that takes into account all the costs of being a landlord and are comfortable being a landlord.
Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.
The Dec. 27 obituary for George Blake, British spy divulged secrets to Soviets, did a good job capturing the remarkable life of one of the Cold War's most dangerous spies. However, the article mistakenly reported that the famed Berlin tunnel — the 1950s CIA and MI6 operation tapping Red Army communications in East Berlin that was betrayed by Blake — produced no worthwhile intelligence and that the Soviets used the phone lines for . . . disinformation. In fact, the consensus now among intelligence historians is that the information captured by the tunnel was valuable and that the KGB likely did not plant false information on the tapped lines. The sheer volume of intercepted phone calls and teletype messages — some 90,000 over 11 months — speaks to the improbability of a disinformation campaign.
In an interview last month with Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, she was asked what her most significant accomplishment was. Hands down, it's changing the national conversation around what K-12 education can and should be, she replied.
That was twice as much as in 2015 but still a fraction of what the men received in 2018: $400 million overall, led by champion France with $38 million.
Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border, Trump tweeted. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!
As director of human resources at Lead Bank, a Kansas City, Kan., bank, Angela Blackburn has striven to a build a workforce that reflects the community. But like many hiring managers, she has struggled with how to wade into a different talent pool.
Police said Burhan N. Ahmed, 20, of Annandale will be charged with aggravated sexual battery, among other offenses.
If that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol, according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Such cases — when there is no obvious likely origin — are the most concerning to health officials and are a primary reason for considering widespread closures and disruptions, officials say. The goal is to limit the spread of the virus by patients who have not yet been diagnosed and quarantined.
4) Continued support for subsidies that help people pay for insurance in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces
Russert: Senator, we have a deficit. We have Social Security and Medicare looming. The number of people on Social Security and Medicare is now 40 million people. It's going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility … Biden: Absolutely. Russert: …cost of living, put it all on the table.
— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.
Consequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.
Her last day was Friday. It has been a privilege to serve America's students alongside you, she wrote in a brief goodbye note to the Education Department staff Friday morning.
[From the archives: Spike of Virginia redistricting plans shows House speaker's pragmatic streak]
Steyer, who got wealthy (and remains wealthy) running a hedge fund, was not the only billionaire looking at a 2020 run. But the Democratic Party, which has elected some independently wealthy candidates to governor's mansions (Illinois's J.B. Pritzker) and Congress (California's Gil Cisneros) very recently, is increasingly cold to the idea of a wealthy candidate barreling into 2020 and spending his own money to elbow aside any challengers.
In the run-up to the World Cup, she received another raise, which did not fall within the time-frame of the latest tax records. Estimates placed her base salary at $500,000. She did not receive a bonus for success in the World Cup qualifying tournament but did earn considerable bonuses for winning the World Cup.
Working-age people with disabilities in the United States have nearly $500 billion a year in disposable income, according to a 2018 report from the American Institutes for Research, making the group one of the largest market segments in the country. But, on average, they make 63 cents on the dollar compared with their non-disabled counterparts.
But the retirements of senior members such as Republicans Bob Goodlatte and Frank Wolf and Democrat Jim Moran and the state's shifting demographics made room for new faces in the delegation.
The op-ed pages, as incubators of ideas, are an irreplaceable forum in our democracy that we need now more than ever.
In response, the USSF said, Our goal is to determine fair and equitable compensation for our USMNT and USWNT, while also being mindful of how and where we invest our overall financial resources so that we can continue to focus on investing in the development of our players, coaches and referees at all levels.
The tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.
Calming fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor
Biden was one of 10 Democrats in the Senate who supported the amendment; 35 Democrats were opposed. But the amendment failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority for passage.
The challenge for people who want to protect democracy is twofold. First, they need to prevent repeat performances of this most recent theater. Drama is an inevitable part of democratic politics. Politicians will always seek to highlight some problem they care about in ways that grab the public's attention. Naked ambition of the sort Hawley and Cruz displayed is also an essential part of politics and can be productive when it is yoked to real political needs. It becomes a problem when ambition leads politicians to blur the boundaries between dramatic fiction and essential political facts, undermining the shared beliefs that hold democracy together.
There are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.
DeVos hired for her team a group of former for-profit college executives, and they worked to dismantle all the protections, block debt relief for ripped-off students, and ensure that federal dollars kept flowing to the worst colleges, said David Halperin, an attorney who has been critical of the for-profit industry.
Of the Democrats, Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Loudoun County has said she would like to serve on the Transportation or Science committees. Her predecessor, Republican Barbara Comstock, served on both.
Presiding over that growing majority became tricky with the rise of more conservative, tea-party-affiliated members, who looked askance at Howell's pragmatic streak.
Newsom's plan comes as other state's are looking to move forward with state-based plans instead of waiting for the federal government. Massachusetts, Washington and New Jersey have new or recently expanded policies on the books, and Jim and Claire report Oregon, Colorado and Connecticut are poised to follow. Still, Newsom's proposal for California would be the most generous.
Neither a socialist nor a lackey of the robber barons, George favored liberty and free enterprise, but he opposed fortunes built upon special privilege, and, in particular, he advocated a single tax on the value of land and the abolition of other taxes. This would enable people to keep what they earned but not enjoy riches from the possession of land that they had done nothing to create.
In the meantime, the Biden administration could clear out the backlog of borrower defense claims using a more generous methodology for approval and loan forgiveness.
Criticism poured in after the IRS posted a notice on its website on Monday instructing Social Security recipients who do not normally send in a return to file a simple tax return, which would be available soon.
Also missing from this picture are the many votes Biden took to increase certain Social Security benefits or block GOP plans; the Biden campaign provides a list of nearly 50 votes from Biden's long Senate career.
But he said he did not pursue her as a possible candidate because of her lack of federal experience. But the more I dug into it and the more I talked to people about it and the more I realized that you couldn't be the state's attorney in Dade County for 15 years without having enormous exposure to a wide range of issues that the Justice Department deals with . . . , he said.

Beto O'Rourke. He is still talking about a road trip where he will personally get Americans' views on their country's politics; he also published an Instagram story of himself at the dentist.
Pete Schramm, a sales engineer based in Maryland, said the mood at the convention was subdued Wednesday over concerns about the coronavirus.
This whole incident has impacted the grill in the sense that it has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy, says Hutchins. The fact is, if I hadn't filed the lawsuit, most people would just kind of think the grill doesn't pay its mortgage and look askance at me. . . I paid them every month, and that's not good enough.
5) More flexibility in the ability to design health coverage benefits
The takes on why the former vice president would be a disastrous candidate are coming fast and furious, especially from writers who saw Clinton as a strong candidate in the early stages of last cycle.
This is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.
trump inverts that policy relationship. in trump's post-cold war world, u.s. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. if trade policy is dominant, we'll see china, mexico and the eu (germany) become competitors. russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.

july. the naacp convention will take place in detroit; typically, the event includes a candidate forum where presidential contenders get equal time to speak and are encouraged to discuss civil rights.
this point really can't be made enough: for the first time, democrats have a majority in the house of representatives that does not include a conservative bloc from the south. the median member of the conference is now a center-left suburbanite.
if democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until pelosi leaves office. since pelosi was elected house minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.
ahh: u.s. health officials are rejecting suggestions to defer the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
trump has complained that he endorsed romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for senate and that romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the senate in early 2019. trump met with romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.
second, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. this means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. the companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.
to figure out how much data you use in a month, follow these steps if you're an android user and these instructions if you're on ios. spend a few weeks analyzing your habits, and some useful trends should emerge.
a growing body of research shows that overuse and misuse of antibiotics in children's hospitals — which health experts and patients say should know better — helps fuel these dangerous bacteria that attack adults and, increasingly, children. doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, kaiser health news's laura ungar reports.
exceeding your monthly cap on a metered plan could result in additional fees or reduced browsing speeds. if you find yourself blowing past your limit on a regular basis, you might consider upgrading to a larger data bucket or to an unlimited plan.
if you signed up for an older unlimited plan years ago before companies such as at&t and verizon stopped selling unlimited plans, should you switch? the answer depends on what you're paying and whether some of the restrictions mentioned above are dealbreakers for you.
— in a report exploring jpmorgan chase's relationship with amazon, the wall street journal's emily glazer, laura stevens and annamaria andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that amazon founder and chief executive jeffrey p. bezos established at the online retail giant. mr. bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and faqs, according to the journal. over roughly the past 18 months, jpmorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under gordon smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [jpmorgan] employees said. jpmorgan has also embraced bezos's customer obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the journal. (bezos owns the post.)
first, fidesz infiltrated much of the state bureaucracy. by 2012, fidesz loyalists were already entrenched in every corner of the state, as miklós bánkuti, gábor halmai and kim lane scheppele documented — including in the constitutional court, budget council, electoral commission, national judicial office, state audit office, public prosecutor's office and national bank. that brings significant advantages. for example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.
more of the same. vietnam's successful handling of the pandemic, improving infrastructure, investor-friendly policies, political stability and its well-educated, young and low-cost workforce is likely to continue attracting international companies. expect further efforts by the new leadership to sell vietnam as an increasingly high-tech manufacturing base for suppliers of global giants such as apple inc. one concern for companies will be the risk that the trade rift with the u.s. could trigger additional tariffs.
feb. 13-16: the democratic national committee meets, also in washington, and will make one of the final big decisions before the primary: the site of the 2020 convention. in the past, this meeting has also drawn in a few presidential contenders, though changes to primary rules have diminished the delegate voting power of dnc members.
hillenkoetter alluded to a case that year involving a soviet intelligence operation wherein our task will be made considerably easier by the appearance in the area of a known homosexual who we think will be extremely helpful in this particular case.
the wave of publicly reported contributions predates those latest developments. but loeffler and perdue both have campaigned for months as lockstep trump backers, including by refusing to acknowledge biden's win. wall street donors nevertheless have been showering the pair with contributions because they are worried that a democratic senate would help president-elect joe biden push for tighter regulations on the financial industry, cnbc's brian schwartz reports, citing an unnamed gop strategist with banking industry clients.
but the taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands. other factions, including breakaway taliban groups and others claiming allegiance to the islamic state, have footholds around the country and potentially could grow stronger without u.s.-led forces to keep them in check.
some residents have seen their contracts changed or even rescinded, as hospitals and medical practices struggle with budget shortfalls. a survey from the american college of emergency physicians found that 20 percent of emergency medicine practices laid off doctors this year. it's a strange paradox in the midst of a pandemic when it seems like emergency medicine doctors should be in high demand.
if the only thing you do is wait for something the senate can pass, then what we might as well do is have the house recess for the next nine months, he said. allowing democrats to dictate immigration policy at a time of republican control of congress and the white house is distasteful and certainly not in keeping with what we promised the american people.
the group's formation builds on unprecedented protests by google workers in recent years. while the tech industry has seen minimal union activity and worker pushback historically, thousands of people at alphabet had banded together to publicly criticize google's handling of sexual harassment complaints, its work with the u.s. military and other issues.
jones's narrow, upset victory over republican roy moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in the post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.
breweries and distilleries: please keep leaving booze on my doorstep.
national security advisor john bolton said on jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that turkey will not target kurdish forces. (reuters)
if the u.s. economy keeps growing through july, this will be the longest expansion in u.s. history. bernanke predicted the economy would achieve this milestone and that people shouldn't fear an immediate downturn just because the nation has never experienced economic growth for this long.
denver drafted a quarterback, memphis's paxton lynch, in the first round last year, but it gave the bulk of the starts this past season to an unheralded second-year player, trevor siemian. the northwestern product acquitted himself respectably, but he led a struggling offense that was called out by members of the broncos' defense, and there is little doubt that a healthy romo would represent an upgrade, at least for a couple of seasons.
during weekend visits to archipelago or cotton and reed — two places where i had never made a reservation in my life — i repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. in the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. in fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: attempts to visit wunder garten or dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.
dickerson declined to answer numerous other questions about the campaign, including what he knew of hoffman's role.
to be sure, boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. he ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly boehner neutralized potential rivals.
we need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation, said republican fcc commissioner ajit pai in a december speech to a conservative think tank.
shaheen also suggested there may be some gray area in the taliban's commitment not to allow terrorist groups to use afghan soil to plan and launch attacks against the united states and its allies.
maddie: we sat for three hours, and i really didn't think it had been that long. it was 10:30 at that point; i'm normally home by 8 on weeknights. we left and he walked me to the metro, even though it was out of his way.
the vast majority of survey respondents — 90 percent — reported having spent more than five years in the military. they have years of experience and expertise that our armed forces can ill-afford to lose.
the policy, if approved by the d.c. council, would take effect in the 2018-19 school year. it could have a significant effect on a public education marketplace that gives parents many options. about 29,000 students from pre-kindergarten through 5th grade were enrolled in d.c. public schools in 2015-16, compared to about 21,600 in charter elementary schools that year.
it's not hard to see a similar dynamic playing with romo, who recovered this season from a back injury, not the first of his career. the broncos still have a terrific defense, talent at wide receiver and running back and, just as importantly, a potential need at his position and the ability to absorb a hefty contract.
elizabeth warren. she sat down with msnbc's rachel maddow on wednesday night, making news when she criticized the foreign policy establishment that had criticized the president's decision to withdraw troops from syria and afghanistan, though she said that the president's process for doing so was too slapdash.
unlike many republican wonks in washington, trump was never interested in removing syrian president bashar al-assad from power. in december, he perfunctorily declared that the islamic state had been defeated — despite mountains of evidence to the contrary — and said it was largely the responsibility of turkey and other arab countries to carry on the fight.
bowser also proposed raising annual facilities funding for charter schools, to $3,193 per pupil. that would be 2.2 percent more than the current level of $3,124 per pupil.
trump has also taken aim at german carmakers, asking why so many americans drive a mercedes-benz when germany buys so few chevrolets, and criticizing bmw over plans to build a new plant in mexico. his criticism may have been unjustified, as bertel schmidt argues in forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.
dec. 19 patrick's campaign relayed his support for drug importation, negotiation and lowering the age of eligibility on medicare.
obama had approved an enormous expansion of the afghan war during his first term in office — a surge bringing military gains that have now been substantially reversed. obama also was unable to end the iraq war as he had hoped.
newmark was among the first donors and made a $500,000 gift. we need a news outlet about gender politics that does a lot of fact-checking with absolutely no mansplaining, he said in an interview.
this is one more headache, hudak said, and one more issue that they do not want to be on the defensive about with the voters.
since ww2, u.s. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. in fact, it's hard to imagine a u.s. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. this means that all other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. in particular, u.s. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the cold war) even if these trade relationships damage u.s. economic performance.
talk with federal employees and you'll quickly learn that sentiment doesn't reflect the views of many, including those in the council's parent union, the american federation of government employees. during the conference call friday, afge's policy director jacqueline simon made it clear that the council's stance does not reflect that of the union.
the hong kong-listed shares of the three telecom majors surged on the news. shares of china mobile, which is among the most valuable of china's listed state-owned enterprises, closed 5.1 percent higher on tuesday, while china telecom and china unicom jumped 3.3 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. nyse's earlier plan to delist the companies followed a u.s. government order, signed by trump in november, that prohibits americans from investing in a list of companies the u.s. government says supply and support china's military, intelligence and security services.

june 17 added bennet's positions based on a survey returned from his campaign.
in clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. it is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. the only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.
july 2 added de blasio's and warren's positions on private insurance based their answers during the first democratic debate. added biden's and adjusted hickenlooper's stances on coverage of undocumented immigrants based on their answers during the debate.

ahead of the meeting, the trump administration released to lawmakers a request to pay $18 billion over 10 years for a mix of walls, fencing and other security technology. gop lawmakers have said they were waiting for the plan to know the parameters of talks with democrats.
of course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. indeed, china's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the united states. yet robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.
medicare-for-all. it's official: the new democratic house will hold hearings on single-payer health care, for the first time in decades — the first time, ever, that the current version of medicare-for-all will go through the committee process.
powell vowed repeatedly friday that the central bank would be flexible as it decides whether to continue raising interest rates in 2019. yellen supported the strategy, saying the fed is in a good position to maintain that flexibility.
many of those i worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. they had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. in many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.
t-mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. verizon, t-mobile and sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 gb a month. this may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their internet usage to a residential broadband plan.
letta has been a vocal critic of trump's handling of the election. when trump tweeted, stop the count the day after polls closed in november, letta responded, it's called democracy!
march 5 warren dropped out of the presidential race.
project birmingham had its roots in the anger and frustration democrats felt after losing the white house and congress in 2016 — with the assistance, many were convinced, of online disinformation peddled by russians and also u.s. conservatives active on social media, who pushed damaging but false information about democrat hillary clinton's health, honesty and suitability for office.
expansions don't die of old age. i like to say they get murdered, bernanke said.
his son jonathan died in a car accident in 1989, and mr. stewart said he plunged into a months-long depression. survivors include his third wife, cheryl, and seven children from his three marriages; his mother; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
no matter what some of our members may think of mr. trump's agenda on immigration and border security, we know that all of them, they need their paychecks and they can't go to the grocery store, pay their rent or their child-care expenses with their love of a wall along the u.s.-mexican border, simon said. we know our members and every single agency affected by the shutdown are terrified that when the day comes that there's no paycheck on payday.
american voters will increase that pressure as government services continue to deteriorate.
early in the pandemic, cities across the country began closing streets to traffic to provide more room for socially distanced running and biking. and by summer, as restaurants took their first steps toward reopening, they began to stake their own claims to the streets, moving tables into pedestrianized roads. the result was charming, comfortable and provided a sense of quasi-normalcy after spring's stay-at-home orders.
late april: one of the last fridays in this month is devoted to house majority whip jim clyburn's fish fry, an annual event that stands out for democrats for a simple reason: it's the biggest political gathering for african american voters in an early primary state.
in the short-term, howard would like to see technology companies step up and create archives of photos and videos that verified politicians post to their accounts. he wants journalists and researchers to be able to access these posts, even if the politicians themselves are not preserving them. he said the archives could be similar to those that some technology companies have set up under intense political pressure to allow third parties to review political ads purchased on their platforms.
within hours of jayapal's announcement, potential 2020 candidates were celebrating. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), arriving at a party held for supporters wednesday, told them that the house would be doing what cynics called impossible just years earlier.
soon after he made his announcement at 2 p.m. during a senate floor speech, the criticism came rolling in fast and furious as he drew denunciations from senior campaign officials, the president's family members, fellow gop senators and his own niece.
adam: i'd personally be interested in a second date. i'm on a quest to go to every metro station on the map; she seemed interested in that, so maybe it could be an informal, casual way to see if there's something there.
stoltenberg called saturday a victory for peace and noted increases in women's rights, life expectancy and respect for human rights.
well, where to begin? for starters, the syntax is so mangled one could be genuinely skeptical he was saying anything more than, russia. afghanistan. give it to putin.
neither trump nor white house staff lobbied romney, according to aides. it wouldn't have helped, said one senior white house aide directly involved in the impeachment process.
beyond daca, republicans and democrats say they're making progress over how much money should go to the military vs. domestic programs, something that has to be settled to raise automatic spending caps.
jan. 23 klobuchar's campaign confirmed her support for following the roe v. wade viability standard.
among republicans, the topic is a particularly treacherous one, because it pulls at the seams of the party's coalition — pitting social conservatives against those who stand most strongly for states' rights, libertarians and fiscal hawks who see the burgeoning marijuana industry as a major source of tax revenue.
maddie: i got more of a friend vibe from our conversation. there wasn't totally a spark there, [but also] i'm not quick to fall for people. i'm still processing things.
in colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim u.s. attorney bob troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.
and the federal every student succeeds act, taking effect next year, creates a tool, the military student identifier number, that will allow schools to keep tabs on test scores, graduation rates and other metrics for military-connected students.
right now, we are focused on stopping distracted driving and less on what the punishments will be for violating the policy, nelson said. we will look at factors such as how egregious a violation is, if someone is doing it repeatedly, if they have received warnings in the past, and other factors to determine the appropriate consequences.
adam:we could pick up the conversation like we were old friends.
but others see the latest changes as more evidence of an administration conflicted and confused about its agenda overseas. bolton got way out ahead of the policy, and it's his job to understand what the president wants, robert ford, a former u.s. ambassador in syria, said to my colleagues. when the president is nervous or cautious about something, it's the nsc's job to relay that back to state and the pentagon, and warn them not to go too far. apparently they didn't get the message.
cannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said rep. dana rohrabacher (r-calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.
thousands of d.c. children who live near public elementary charter schools could soon qualify for a new admission preference to help them enroll in those schools under a plan mayor muriel e. bowser (d) announced monday.
romney told the washington post that he asked the white house for more information about actions taken toward ukraine, particularly concerning acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, but none was provided. he wanted former national security adviser john bolton to testify, which he said could have potentially raised reasonable doubt that the president did anything wrong and lead him to vote to acquit. the senate rejected subpoenaing bolton.
of course, once manning was released, he eventually landed with the broncos, which worked out very well for everyone in denver. coming off multiple neck surgeries, the decorated quarterback not only rewrote the record book but won a super bowl in february 2016.
there are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.
whether the thirst for vengeance against romney is sustained will hinge on trump, who has long smarted from the utah republican's criticism of him and takes pride in hitting back at perceived and real enemies.
the program will be tested in seven states, including maryland. the usda has partnered with several local and national retailers for the two-year pilot, including hy-vee and freshdirect. in maryland, snap recipients will be able to choose among amazon, safeway and shoprite. participants will be able to use snap to pay for eligible items, but delivery charges will come out of their own pockets. bread, meat, fruits and vegetables are permitted; household items, beer and cigarettes are among the prohibited goods. (disclosure: amazon and the washington post share an owner.)

as decades of market-oriented economic reforms boost incomes and nurture a growing middle class, vietnam is among the world's most optimistic countries, according to a nielsen survey. yet human rights advocates criticize restrictions of basic political and civil freedoms. arrests and trials of vietnamese who speak out on issues such as corruption have grown markedly following a new cybersecurity law in 2019, according to carl thayer, emeritus professor at the university of new south wales in australia. there's typically an up-tick in arrests before the party congress, he said.
we can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. as health and human services secretary alex azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.
with the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, powell said during a panel discussion at the american economic association annual meeting alongside former fed chairs janet l. yellen and ben bernanke. we're always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary.
this is not the first time i've disagreed with mitt, and i imagine it will not be the last, she said in statement. the bottom line is president trump did nothing wrong, and the republican party is more united than ever behind him. i, along with the gop, stand with president trump.
prime minister nguyen xuan phuc, 66, who has won plaudits for guiding the country through the pandemic relatively unscathed, may be in the running for the party chief. his chief rival could be the incumbent's protege, tran quoc vuong, 67, head of the party's central office, who spearheaded trong's aggressive anti-corruption campaign. trong, 76, may even pursue another full or partial third term. possible contenders for other top jobs:
every time it's delayed, the movement just gets stronger, the outcry gets louder, he added.
march 31: it's the end of the first fundraising quarter, the first traditional gut check and re-sorting of any presidential field. in the 2008 cycle, this was the moment when barack obama nearly matched hillary clinton's money haul, firming up the idea that he was a credible challenger. note that obama announced his numbers in the first week of april; campaigns are not required to turn everything in to the federal election commission until april 15, but increasingly, campaigns like to get a jump on the official filing and calculate their totals for the press.

people close to romney say he knows where he currently stands in the republican party — on an island — but will not be cowed by trump's attacks. while he agrees with trump regularly on policy, his advisers said he sees standing up against some of trump's behavior as a moral imperative.
kaine annoyed some in the obama white house by pushing for senate review of the 2001 military authorization, and he argues that congressional oversight is even more essential now. like other democrats, however, he takes issue with trump's seat-of-the-pants style.
the controversy over instagram stories highlights the challenge for technology companies as the tools they created to connect friends are increasingly being used for political messaging — perhaps with consequences they never intended.
sessions's directive, issued last week, overturns an obama-era policy discouraging federal enforcement in states where marijuana is legal. the attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.
adam: i walked her back to the metro and asked for her phone number.
will it really hurt us among young voters? it could, reed acknowledged, but he added: you cannot ignore a federal law on the books. it breeds cynicism. it undermines respect. it undermines confidence in government itself.
bytes: ford is set to start testing self-driving vehicles in the nation's capital early this year, and officials in washington and other cities are working to anticipate how technological changes in transportation will affect their communities, according to the post's michael laris. d.c. and other cities partnered with the aspen institute and bloomberg philanthropies to set common goals for developers of driverless cars. high on the list of priorities is cutting greenhouse gases and other pollution, eliminating congestion and ensuring that officials have the opportunity to adapt as changes barrel ahead, michael wrote. the initiative also includes los angeles, austin, london, sao paulo, brazil, and other cities.
cargill — whose businesses range from agriculture to financial services — decided to act because of the ubiquity of smartphones and a growing number of statistics suggesting that these devices are too often the culprits in traffic crashes, nelson said. there was no specific incident that caused the company to to implement the policy, she said.
finally, ruling parties may pack judiciaries, electoral commissions and other nominally independent bodies to ensure that the incumbent will win critical electoral, legal or other disputes.
dan feldman, who served as obama's special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan, supports the current trump administration efforts to foster peace talks with the taliban and said trump undercut that effort by demanding an arbitrary drawdown.

if you frequently travel to canada or mexico, t-mobile arguably offers the easiest solution in its unlimited plan. data roaming is included for those countries, and you don't have to go out of your way to add on a roaming package. you use your data just like you would in the united states. t-mobile was also the first to liberalize its broader international roaming policies, which remain pretty competitive.
before dickerson had sent his statement to the post, morgan, the new knowledge chief, had publicly denied writing the project birmingham report or knowing about most of what it describes.
a second-round pick in 2014, garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when tom brady was serving his deflategate suspension. the 25-year-old completed 68.3 of his passes for 502 yards, four touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 113.3 rating, showing impressive decision-making and pocket presence.
the reversal comes after more consulting about a recent u.s. investment ban: in a statement, the big board said 'it no longer intends to move forward with the delisting action' on china mobile ltd., china telecom corp. and china unicom (hong kong) ltd, the wsj's chong koh ping and ben otto report.
snap grew significantly after the recession, but the number of caseloads has declined in recent years, according to the center on budget and policy priorities. more than 44 million americans benefit from the program; nearly half are children. another push for access in 2013 expanded snap acceptance at farmers markets nationwide.
meanwhile, gardner said he is marshaling fellow lawmakers to oppose the new policy. a dozen senators met tuesday in gardner's office to talk about what we need to be doing legislatively and the direction we should be pursuing in congress on this matter, he said.
nov. 1 o'rourke dropped out of presidential race
the piece itself is funny, but it also gets at something that greatly aided warren this week: as the first credible female candidate in the democratic race, she endured the first attempts to brand a female candidate as unlikable, and that rallied even some democrats who don't plan to support her.
a bipartisan meeting on immigration policy at the white house on tuesday is designed to bring the sides together. if trump and lawmakers can strike an immigration deal, negotiators on both sides think that other issues, including how to fund a children's health insurance program and a roughly $80 billion package to pay for disaster relief, could be resolved.
finally, fidesz has changed the electoral rules in ways that make it easier for the party to dominate. that includes significant gerrymandering — splitting off constituencies with a leftist majority to dilute the opposition vote.
joe biden, who has the most foreign policy experience among frequently mentioned potential 2020 democrats, opposed the large-scale troop surge when he served as barack obama's vice president. he favored a smaller counterterrorism force.
democrats have done a poor job of playing hardball, said angel padilla, the group's policy director. they said for three months they would use their leverage in december to get this done, and that didn't happen. in order to have leverage, the other side has to believe you'll use that leverage, and i don't think that [republicans] think that [democrats] will use that leverage.
while debate continues over who did what in project birmingham, the post was able to find some evidence for several of the claims in the explanatory document.
such a network would be about ten times as fast as the current speeds available to most consumers today, ncta president michael powell tells me. lab trials of the technology are already underway, and they expect field trials to begin in 2020. he says broadband at these speeds could enable a host of new technologies, by enabling better video streaming or making it easier to use connected home devices. both trends are expected to be in the spotlight this week at the annual trade show.
she and her husband were recently critical of the way murdoch media properties have covered the australian wildfires. in an interview with the post, she shied away from commenting about fox news or other murdoch outlets. this is what i do, and i'm happy to be taken to task on any of it, but that is all i control.
and ephemeral messaging is only becoming more prevalent in the run-up to the 2020 campaign: sen. elizabeth warren, for instance, cracked open a beer in her instagram story last week after announcing her presidential bid. former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who's weighing a 2020 run, was a frequent instagram stories user during his 2018 campaign for senator, showing personal moments even after he lost of himself eating guacamole while driving.
what do i get if i travel a lot?
but after sessions announced the new policy, the white house declared that trump was completely in agreement.
adam: we both found out — weird fact — we're both missing our front teeth.
opponents of the rules point out that the fcc's regulation created an imbalance in the law: while internet providers must (for now) obey the restrictions, nothing forces web companies such as google and facebook to do the same. for the past three years, the fcc under democratic leadership has repeatedly vowed not to regulate web companies, giving rise to complaints by telecom and cable lobbyists that the fcc was biased in their favor.
in an interview on msnbc on wednesday night, warren took issue with the president's style but not his position that the united states should bow out of what she called endless wars.
house democrats vow new efforts on relief.
the anti-gay policy damaged him abroad but not in jamaica, where he often strolled (without bodyguard) around kingston to shouts of mornin', butch! in his office one morning in 1996, while he lounged in a beige armchair wearing his trademark harrods of london striped shirt — no tie — and with one foot on a glass coffee table, he was asked by a journalist for the london independent: what are you worth?
romney said he couldn't let concerns over breaking with his party guide his vote, which he cast as one of conscience and rooted in his religious beliefs.
oct. 27 added responses from steyer. two sestak answers are now included that were not displayed in a previous version due to a technical error.
it is unclear if the reduction in violence will hold in the coming weeks as afghan government officials and the taliban begin talks. the afghan government initially demanded a cease-fire before agreeing to talks with the taliban.

so far, the united states has only administered a small fraction of the vaccine doses that have been distributed to states, according to a washington post tracker, which looks at vaccine priorities and administration state by state.
irrelevant relic, trump campaign manager brad parscale wrote on twitter.
trump, of course, has also taken issue with china over its island-building in the south china sea, and he has publicly questioned american adherence to the one-china policy, the basis for diplomatic relations between the two countries that rules out independence for the island of taiwan.
the university assumed control of the fraternity and sorority organizational misconduct and adjudication process, and established a team of monitors who perform regular spot checks. these compliance checks have surfaced violations of our new safety rules and resulted in several chapters receiving sanctions.
yet in the last several weeks, donors from wall street and beyond have stepped up support for two trump stalwarts in georgia.
howard said on sunday that brazil president jair bolsonaro's use of instagram stories put a fine point on the fact that the trend has extended beyond u.s. politicians:
june: the first official democratic presidential primary debate will take place, location to be determined. the dnc has sanctioned six debates in 2019, all of them to be held outside the first four primary states. that means, in practice, that the candidates who make it onstage will burn 12 to 18 days this year on prep, travel and the debates themselves.
many of the places where marijuana legalization is most popular — in california, for instance, where it has just taken effect — are also areas where republicans are struggling the hardest to hold onto house seats.
this strikes me as a typical trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of afghanistan, says former ambassador to turkey, eric s. edelman. the soviet union went into afghanistan to prop up one faction of the people's democratic party of afghanistan (pdpa) against another. their invasion catalyzed the existing islamist opposition to the pdpa but i digress. (in other words, trump's claim russia went into afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) edelman adds, simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.
if you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. if afghanistan brought down the soviet union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would russian president vladimir putin go back in?
he twice put his money where his mouth was for jamaica when its foreign currency holdings were low and democratic socialism was on the rise: first in the 1970s and '80s when he realized the island had to build tourism hotels. then, in 1992, when the economy was threatened by currency speculators, he pumped $30 million of his own money into jamaican banks to keep them afloat.
wonder woman 1984 won't top my washington dc area film critics association nominations for best picture. but i'd be shocked if it didn't win the group's joe barber award for best portrayal of washington, d.c. more movies that purport to care about the capital and what happens here should take note.
the remaining 13 democrats come from a range of districts, from the most trump-friendly place represented by a democrat (minnesota's 7th) to nevada's 3rd district, where trump actually won a smaller share of the vote than mitt romney; third-party voters were responsible for his win margin.
the president picked powell for the fed's top job in late 2017 but has quickly soured on him after the fed raised interest rates a full percentage point last year, an action that can slow the economy. several of trump's top aides have said publicly that the president can't fire powell because fed appointees can only be removed for cause, which courts have interpreted as criminal activity.
the study focused on four states with large military populations, including virginia. among the findings, it noted overall success in the state, which has a wide distribution of military families and has military kids in every district. but it also found that many districts struggle to meet the academic and social emotional needs of military-connected students.
the public deserve to understand the costs and consequences of war, lee said. congress has been missing in action.
that report, he said, came from new knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. more recently, it co-authored a report last month on russian disinformation for the senate intelligence committee.
orban's hungary is a prime example of a competitive autocracy with an uneven playing field. in 2010, orban's fidesz party won 53 percent of the vote and 68 percent of parliamentary seats. since then, the party has increasingly denied opposition access to resources necessary to compete for power.
i want to congratulate the house for holding hearings for the first time on medicare-for-all, he told the post. i'm confident the results will show that medicare-for-all is the way forward if we want to guarantee health care to all people in a cost-effective way.
july 11-13: the 14th netroots nation conference will take place in philadelphia; for the third time, it will feature some sort of forum for democratic presidential candidates. in 2007, that took the form of a debate, which made some news when hillary clinton got into an argument about lobbyists (they represent real americans). in 2015 it became a series of q&as with the candidates who had bothered to show up; both martin o'malley and bernie sanders were interrupted by black lives matter activists. this year, organizers say the format is to be determined.
a florida state representative is calling for mar-a-lago to be shut down after president trump's private club held a new year's eve bash in which attendees did not wear masks in violation of a palm beach county mask order, the post's lori rozsa reports . palm beach county officials said they were reviewing the complaint from state rep. omari hardy, a democrat from nearby lake worth beach.
bartenders in the united states, though, tend to dislike the concept, because time is money, and they could be pouring beers or whipping up drinks instead of stopping to take cash or run credit cards from the same group multiple times throughout the night. it's more economical to just wait until everyone is leaving.
at various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their fica (payroll) tax. this, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the social security trust fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.
michelle lerner, the spokeswoman for dcps, said the school system looks forward to working with the city on the lottery changes so that all families can access high-quality schools.
hoffman also has denied knowing about the operation in alabama, though he has acknowledged providing the money to aet and apologized for his role in how it was eventually used.
morgan characterized the work as a small, limited research project on facebook while speculating that project birmingham as described in the debrief document was a combination of his efforts and those that might have been conducted by others. he described the project birmingham document as aet's report — suggesting it had been a product of dickerson's start-up, american engagement technologies, also known as aet.
ghani also pointed to advances made in afghan society, including freedom of speech and the advancement of women's rights.
past partisans often preferred weaker leaders
under the city's current policy, students have a guaranteed seat in a traditional public school near their home. but those assigned neighborhood schools — all part of the d.c. public schools — are sometimes more than a half mile away. that can make it hard for elementary students to walk to school.
there are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, bolton said. the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.
i don't have any money. i sank it all into this, he replied, indicating a model of an air jamaica jetliner. we come out of a culture that says everything that happens has to be done by the government. more and more people are realizing you've got to do it on your own.
university-hired chapter monitors are working with representatives of each fraternity house with respect to their chapter's specific risk-management programs. risk-management programs must be in place and approved by the university and must include details on how our restrictions on the size of gatherings, our ban on hard liquor and various other required safety protocols will be implemented. the university must approve each plan before any socials involving alcohol are permitted.
terry mcauliffe. he published an op-ed in the post today, urging democrats to run on realistic solutions in 2020 — one way of saying they risked swinging too far to the left.
beginning in 1953, when president dwight eisenhower signed an executive order denying work to those suspected of sexual perversion, thousands of gay men and women were forced out of the federal bureaucracy. while the exact number of victims claimed by this lavender scare is difficult to quantify, one scholar estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people were affected, far exceeding those expelled in the simultaneous (not to mention much more extensively documented and remembered) red scare.
new york confirmed its first case of the new u.k. strain on monday. the case was identified in a 60-year-old man who had no recent travel history and comes after cases have also been identified in california, florida and colorado.

u.s. chamber of commerce ceo tom donohue said, efforts by some members of congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.
during a november oval office meeting with political advisers, some suggested attacking romney but trump told them to hold off, hoping he would stick with republicans on impeachment.
july 30 included information from harris's new health-care proposal. added sestak.
vaccine administration rates vary across states. while georgia has vaccinated 0.7 percent of its population, south dakota has vaccinated 3 percent of its population.
this is unacceptable. it's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. first, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. we want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. the model here is the bermuda principles for the human genome project, where results were posted nightly.
but unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when russians worked to help elect donald trump, the people behind the alabama effort — dubbed project birmingham — were americans. now democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in project birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.
jan. 19: the third women's march will take place around the country, with special plans for washington, where organizers are putting together a lobbying day focused on getting a house vote on medicare-for-all and where they'll release a women's agenda, this will be the first of these marches since a battery of controversies for the umbrella women's march organization, especially of the association between one organizer and louis farrakhan. but most democrats with presidential ambitions have spoken at previous marches and are expected to again.
dec. 3 harris dropped out of presidential race.
u.s. military leaders are beginning to recognize the readiness connection.
parents and greek alumni should provide a much higher level of support to their chapters and provide guidance and mentoring. sadly, we found in our monitoring that parents of students in some chapters helped students violate the law and university rules against alcohol consumption.
yet even incremental health coverage expansion won't necessarily be possible in the senate, even if ossoff and warnock win.

the double-edged advocacy reflects the quandary facing many industry leaders as president trump continues his unprecedented attempt to overturn the election with the backing of a majority of republican lawmakers.
this is a rules package that encourages us to tackle the most pressing issues facing our nation today, mcgovern said in a floor speech monday. it makes reforms to our budget rules so we can deal with these dual challenges through an all-hands-on-deck approach while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
the white house wants to set discretionary defense spending levels at about $603 billion, which would exceed current automatic spending caps by $54 billion. republicans think non-defense levels should see less of an increase, closer to $35 billion. but democrats are insisting on parity, arguing in recent weeks that non-defense spending bolsters programs to fight opioid addiction and terrorism and protect the southern border.
pompeo called the moment historic and said the taliban needed to live up to commitments to break with al-qaeda and reduce violence.
on launch day, the organization, which has hired an editor in chief, will post 17 jobs; nine in the newsroom including beats covering women in congress, in the economy, statehouses and several others. they are hiring to fill positions to cover specific demographics that make up the female electorate, including black and latina women. the site will have no opinion or editorial section.
with that in mind, an intriguing possibility emerged: what if the ultimate goal of that trade was to pry jimmy garoppolo away from the patriots?
bitcoin also tumbled: the cryptocurrency briefly dipped below $30,000 monday, just two days after breaching that level for the first time, cnbc's ryan browne reports.
despite trump's renewed calls for a border wall, republicans remain frayed over how to move forward. some moderates are willing to either pass a bill giving dreamers a path to citizenship or craft a deal with democrats that would include some border security measures. but the bulk of the conservative rank-and-file want more in exchange for accepting an immigration policy that much of the republican base opposes.
all of this would be fine if the action sequences were any good; sadly, they are not. perhaps it's just a function of watching this at home via hbo max, as most people will, but everything on screen felt cheap and bland. there's nothing as exciting as the german assault on wonder woman's home island of themyscira or her march through a world war i no man's land in the first film; everything is weightless and silly.
oof: england is entering a new national lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak driven by a new, more contagious virus variant.
in a stark contrast from federal agencies and the white house, which must comply with strict record-keeping rules, members of congress have broad discretion over what they archive.
this fealty to d.c. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a silver line (or a green line!) in 1984, a pass. and it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for d.c.: ww84 joins breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of d.c. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.
among our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. while more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.

afghan officials have repeatedly criticized the united states for excluding them from talks with the taliban. any significant withdrawal of u.s. forces from the country is expected to place increased pressure on afghan government forces, whose casualty rates continue to rise.
d.c. breweries and distilleries have always had the legal ability to deliver their products directly to consumers. virginia and maryland producers had a few more hoops to jump through, but could also deliver or ship beer. but it wasn't until the pandemic shut bars and tasting rooms, denying them much needed revenue, that most began to look into it.
early indications are that they could head in significantly different directions, reflecting different priorities.
why the new democratic majority could work better than the last, by ronald brownstein
the president believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said. that would be his top priority. that is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law.
many foreign observers, already glued to news of the final chapters of the election saga, reacted with alarm and even grief, especially in allied countries that have looked to u.s. democracy for inspiration.
draft picks are extremely important to our approach in building a championship caliber football team, brown added. we are intent on adding competition to every position on our roster and look forward to having brock come in and compete.
and the publication is not averse to hiring men — its cfo is male.
but a fighting force — even one as formidable as the united states military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. for service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. these choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.
jan. 22 added questions about abortion restrictions and requiring private plans cover abortions.
attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they write, adding there should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power.
the facts on the ground suggest the timetable will be rather open-ended. the diplomatic wrangling with turkey — which has vowed a military operation against kurdish units across its southern border — may prove to be deeply complicated. a security guarantee for the syrian kurds could just be a new unobtainable condition, tweeted faysal itani of the atlantic council. seeing their options dwindling, the main syrian kurdish armed faction has opened talks with the assad regime, requesting military support from damascus against a potential turkish offensive.
apple's warning that its sales would fall short last week has contributed to fears about an economic slowdown and the overall stability of the technology sector. apple is set to encounter multiple hurdles in china this year amid the trade dispute between washington and beijing as well as increasing competition from local rivals, reuters's josh horwitz and stephen nellis reported. apple also faces a preliminary injunction by a chinese court banning sales of several iphone models, but the ban has not been enforced yet. apple is not expected to roll out a 5g phone in china before next year, which would place it behind competitors including huawei, xiaomi and samsung, reuters also reported.

the venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. the ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the american economy, berkshire's warren buffett said in a statement at the time. our group does not come to this problem with answers. but we also do not accept it as inevitable.

indeed, he has suggested as much, telling fox news last month that he didn't know why the united states had to be bound by the one-china policy unless we make a deal with china having to do with other things, including trade.
canadian prime minister justin trudeau told canada's news 1130 radio station in vancouver that his government is concerned and following the situation minute by minute.
republicans at the fcc were already anticipating the opportunity last month.
more to the point, why is trump handing off chunks of the world — syria, afghanistan, the sea of azov — to america's greatest international foe? (some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) and where does this giveaway stop — at the baltics? at berlin? (it's stunning that hawks such as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), who'd melt down if president barack obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)
although marijuana is illegal under federal law, eight states and the district of columbia have passed laws allowing recreational consumption. pot is legal, in some form or under some circumstances, in an additional 22 states.
thank you for your attention, and for your commitment to these efforts. much remains to be done, and the memory of timothy piazza deserves nothing less than our collective action.
it slammed broward county sheriff scott israel, saying he was partly to blame because he had changed active shooter policy to say that deputies may enter a building to engage a shooter, indicating it wasn't necessary. israel has changed the policy again. the report also noted that some sheriff's deputies said they could not remember the last time they underwent training for an active shooter.

democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock are seeking to unseat republican sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue, and give their party 50 seats in the senate, making vice president-elect kamala d. harris the tie-breaking vote. polls in georgia close at 7 p.m., concluding a race that has seen record-breaking spending for a nonpresidential election.
the shutdown is the country's third after lockdowns initiated in march and november, the post's karla adam, jennifer hassan and ben guarino report. johnson said the new variant of the virus, which has so far spread to at least 30 countries, is thought to be 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible.
the 1969 stonewall uprising against police harassment at a greenwich village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. but a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in washington, d.c., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights.
u.s. envoy zalmay khalilzad and taliban deputy leader mullah abdul ghani baradar inked the deal on an ornate desk in an opulent hall at a hotel in doha, qatar, on saturday. secretary of state mike pompeo attended the ceremony and witnessed the signing while seated across from the two men.
march 24-26: one of the largest annual political events in the country, the aipac policy conference, will be held in downtown washington. traditionally, the off-year sessions don't give many speaking slots to presidential candidates; that's reserved for election years. but the event, anchored by a lengthy speech from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, is built to showcase the clout of pro-israel lobbyists, and worries about declining support for israel among democratic voters have become a topic there.
it's been a year since the first rumblings of a coronavirus outbreak in china. on jan. 4, 2020, the world health organization tweeted that it was investigating a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan. the following day the u.s. agency said that china reported its first cases to the who on dec. 31, 2019, and that at least 44 cases had been reported, the post's siobhán o'grady reports
we're not there right now, and we're going to start working on it again when we come back, coffman said.
the point: if republicans knocked off every democrat from a red-tinted district who voted for pelosi today, and reelected every one of their incumbents, they'd come out of 2020 with a majority. but the map isn't that simple.
we should be worried, as cohen points out, that trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for america. perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among american leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of u.s. foreign policy. . . . trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the united states is merely one great power among others. in this view, washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of u.s. leaders so carefully built.
we don't have any doghouses here. the most important vote is the next vote, he said.
before he retired, then-army chief of staff gen. ray odierno indicated that local school performance would be a factor in the placement of army units around the country. if state and local officials intend to keep military bases in their communities, odierno said in 2013, they better start paying attention to the schools that are outside and inside our installations. because as we evaluate and as we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria. he commissioned a study, highlighting which schools are successful — and which are not — to examine the quality of schools that serve the children of soldiers.
trump, who visited troops in iraq last month in his first trip to a war zone, has said he supports the continuation of that mission. but he has ordered the gradual departure of about half the approximately 14,000 u.s. forces in afghanistan.
this is the first question you'll want to answer before you grapple with the carriers' various offerings. let's say you don't use your mobile data for very much beyond basic web browsing and email. or maybe the bulk of your smartphone usage happens while you're at home or at the office, where there's wifi. under those conditions, you might be better off signing up for a metered plan — that is, one with a monthly data cap.

trump, who suggested the shutdown could last for months or even years, displayed woeful ignorance of the plight of federal workers at a news conference friday, when he said they would encourage him to keep going with the shutdown, because a border wall is far more important than a fully operational government. he apparently got that impression from border patrol officers he met with thursday. these officers, federal workforce outliers, endorsed his wall, just as they did his candidacy, even though they are also victims of his shutdown.
march 4 bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race.
to guarantee a decent wage, a number of places i've visited in the past year, from fancy restaurants to casual cocktail spots to rooftop beer gardens, have levied mandatory service charges of around 20 percent. they offer the chance to leave more, but not less, preventing customers from stiffing a server over a perceived slight. it's a great start — we should all be adding 20 percent anyway, right? — while the industry and governments come to grips with the mechanics and failures of tipping. gratitude is a buzzword this year. let's start with restaurant employees.
the fed releases minutes from the fomc's december meeting
jan. 30 adjusted gabbard and yang's position on medicare-for-all to better reflect their health-care plans.
it would be nice to have a frank and a candid exchange up close and personal, kudlow said friday morning in an interview on bloomberg tv. president trump would benefit. i think jay powell would benefit.
mr. stewart eventually caught up with the times and abolished the policy in 2004, and the sandals resorts have continued to prosper. he created the beaches resorts for families, also a major success.
— tesla wants the trump administration to spare the model 3's chinese-made computer brain from tariffs, according to reuters's david shepardson. the 25 percent tariffs enacted in august are hurting the company's profitability, according to tesla. increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability, tesla said in a request to the government for tariff exemption, as shepardson reported. the company also said in the request that it has not been able to find another supplier with the required specifications, at the volume requested and under the timelines necessary for tesla's continued growth.
warren, like other democrats and some republicans, took issue with trump's abrupt announcement via twitter last month that he would immediately close out the troop commitment in syria. roughly 2,000 u.s. forces are there under a limited mandate authorized by obama in 2015.
april 3 added o'rourke positions based on survey returned from his campaign.
july 15 added biden's positions from his health-care proposal.
but after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to iowa, the stakes for warren are high. this is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. warren's first event on saturday is at one of sioux city's largest arts venues, one that clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another democrat who may run for president.
the second-largest u.s. trade deficit in 2016 was with japan, at $62.4 billion. japan largely got a pass from the united states when it used protectionism and state subsidies to build its industries after world war ii: then, it was seen as a key strategic ally worth supporting despite running a large trade surplus with the united states.
fidesz's ambiguous tactics have succeeded. most importantly, the european union has, with a few exceptions, failed to confront orban's government about its democratic backsliding. as long as orban is able to maintain such ambiguity, he is unlikely to face serious consequences for his country's democratic failures.
the merits of the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria were a back-burner issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite democratic vice-presidential nominee sen. tim kaine's long-running effort to force a reconsideration of the george w. bush-era war authorization.
morgan, in comments to the post and in a blog post on the self-publishing site medium, acknowledged conducting some experiments with disinformation tactics during the alabama election. those included creating a facebook page called alabama conservative politics that shared news links with its followers. he also said that new knowledge spent about $30,000 on targeted facebook advertising during the alabama election season and that he bought some retweets to test his ability to lift social media messages.
unemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. two important considerations: some big state trust funds (new york, california and texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.
the republican talking points are the things we heard in the general elections, [that the democrats are] radical socialists who want a government-run health-care system, said ken thorpe, professor of health policy at emory university. on almost every ad it's either directly talked about or implied.
the south florida sun sentinel quoted broward county school board member lori alhadeff, whose daughter alyssa was killed in the shooting:
the attorney general is going to find out pretty quickly he's in a distinct minority, not only among the american public, but in the united states congress, said john hudak, deputy director of the brookings institution's center for effective public management and author of the 2016 book marijuana: a short history.
we're pulling out of syria, trump said sunday, before offering a significant caveat. but ... we won't be finally pulled out until isis is gone.
fourth on the list comes mexico, which ran a trade surplus with the united states of $58.8 billion in 2016. trump, of course, is already preparing to build that wall, and get the mexicans to pay for it.
wall street starts the new year with a selloff.
she continued in her role as editor in chief of the texas tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. in march last year, she sat down with amanda zamora, the tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit propublica, and presented her idea.
amy klobuchar. she told the minneapolis star-tribune that she will decide soon on a 2020 bid.
with the 39-year-old brady's play showing no signs of deterioration en route to a championship season, the patriots have the luxury of dangling garoppolo for a king's ransom or simply keeping him for one more season as an excellent insurance policy against a possible brady injury. new england recently signaled it was more than willing to take the latter approach, but that could be a negotiating stance.
also worth noting: while a few democrats pledged specifically not to back pelosi, many more found routes around the pelosi question, saying that they wanted to see new leadership, or see who was seeking the gavel — and then, after the election, saying that pelosi had won them over.
it cleveland doesn't turn around and trade osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. that may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what nba teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the nfl, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. in any event, if it helps land the highly regarded garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.
they are unnecessary, unjustified, unmoored from a cost-benefit assessment, and unlikely to advance the commission's stated goal of enhancing consumer privacy, wrote the internet & television association, known as ncta.
in the version of the document distributed at the meeting, a black rectangle obscured part of a sentence that would have made clear the name of the entity that conducted project birmingham. after weeks of declining to comment, dickerson told the post that the redaction was nk — for new knowledge.
july 31 added quotes from the first night of the second democratic debate about health care for undocumented immigrants.
florida's mental and behavioral health system is underfunded. florida needs a better case management system, but no case management system can be effective unless there are effective services through which a person can be managed.
some big outdoor spaces, such as the midlands beer garden and biergarten haus, take reservations while leaving most space available for walk-ins — consider a booking an insurance policy — and i'd even think twice about making the trip out to some of the region's bigger farm breweries, including wheatland spring and waredaca, if i hadn't reserved a table in advance. will we return to a more laissez faire system of bar crawls in the future? maybe. in the meantime, i'm going to stick to my calendar.
at&t, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, directv or u-verse. it doesn't matter if you already have at&t cellular service but not tv, or vice versa. you just need to end up with both phone and tv service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. this might not make sense if you already get your tv service through a company such as comcast or verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to tv. note that directv now, at&t's online streaming tv service, doesn't count toward this program. so if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (update: at&t has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of at&t's tv services.)
the 15-member commission included sheriffs from several florida counties, including pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri, who served as chairman. the fathers of three students killed during the rampage were also appointed. the report will be sent to the florida legislature and governor. the panel interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed a massive amount of evidence, it said.

republican candidates for congress will answer that question based on what fits their district or state, said ralph reed, head of the faith and freedom coalition, an evangelical political group that has campaigned against legalization.
the roster of high-profile financiers cutting checks directly to one or both of the incumbents in recent weeks, per schwartz and our own review of the candidates' most recent federal election filings, includes: hedge fund billionaire john paulson; fortress investment group ceo randal nardone; arsenal capital partner stephen mclean; silver point capital ceo edward mule; aqr capital management co-founder clifford asness; owl rock capital co-founder doug ostrover; and soroban capital co-founder eric mandelblatt.
in normal times, restaurant and bar writers look for the new and different: breaking trends, hot chefs or bars that offer a vibe their neighbors don't. this inherent tendency to seek what's fresh and exciting is, i think, why businesses are so often praised and admired for pivoting to new models during the pandemic, when whiplash changes to menus and physical spaces are often born less of creative innovation than desperately trying to find a way for the business to stay afloat. for some, it was building a beer garden in the parking lot; for others, it was tossing out their critically acclaimed menus to make sandwiches and simpler fare.
leading hawks in washington, including key figures within the administration, see things much differently. secretary of state mike pompeo, national security adviser john bolton and trump's special envoy to syria, former diplomat james jeffrey, all argue that u.s. military involvement in syria is aimed not just at defeating islamist militants but also at countering iranian influence in syria.
when we accepted charters into the city, they were supposed to be city-wide schools. what happened to that? thompson asked. do we just throw that away because we are trying to get at a different problem?
spokesmen for the senators said the lawmakers support dreamers but had various reasons for backing the last spending bill.
the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan has documented more than 100,000 civilian casualties since the organization began its tally in 2009.
any significant health-care legislation will likely originate in the democrat-run house.
stocks surged after powell's remarks, with the dow jones industrial average leaping more than 600 points in late-morning trading. the fed has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but wall street traders and trump don't want any. powell's comments indicate the fed might be revising its views.
pompeo, a vocal advocate of the anti-iran strategy, will make an eight-country swing through all six members of the gulf cooperation council — saudi arabia, kuwait, the united arab emirates, qatar, bahrain and oman — as well as egypt and jordan. he will try to present a united front despite the white house's increasingly incoherent approach to the region.
britain's membership of the eu had meant the region's banks and investors could bypass the home exchanges of stocks such as paris-listed luxury-goods giant lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton se and amsterdam-listed just eat takeaway.com nv, the big food-delivery company, and trade them in london over alternative venues … but with the brexit trade agreement taking effect jan. 1, that option ended.
may 6 added castro's position on covering undocumented immigrants.
since the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. a variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.
he was a considered a white jamaican with european roots, but he was born and bred on the island and retained his caribbean accent. as well as his resorts, he founded the daily jamaica observer to compete with the island's oldest newspaper, the gleaner (launched in 1834).
trump's friday statement said ultimately it will be up to the people of afghanistan to work out their future. we, therefore, urge the afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.
other journalists, however, expressed skepticism at the time, noting that the supposed russian bots made obvious mistakes, leaving profile information in some tweets in cyrillic, the russian-language alphabet.
scholten, who ran 14 points ahead of hillary clinton in the district, had campaigned with a number of lesser-known democrats with presidential ambitions. warren, he said, had sent three fundraising letters on behalf of his campaign; when he was at the 2018 netroots nation conference in new orleans, warren made time for a meeting with him.
a senior trump campaign official said the longer the romney news cycle drags on, the worse it is for the president, because it focuses attention on his impeachment. advisers were encouraging trump to not dignify romney's vote with a response, and there were no immediate plans to campaign against romney.
with the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them, said dan conston, the new president of the congressional leadership fund, in a statement from the republican super pac. clf will make sure voters know that their member of congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch san francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.
access to at-home internet is somewhat more common among the poor than access to a car — 88 percent vs. 79.6 percent . take mobile, ala., where a third of residents are both below poverty level and live farther than half a mile from the nearest supermarket. ninety-one percent of those below the poverty line have internet access, and only 76 percent have a car. the option of home-delivered groceries, assuming the internet access is fast enough to use the websites of grocery providers, could make life less stressful.
hoffman gave $750,000 to a progressive technology start-up called american engagement technologies — founded by mikey dickerson, a former obama administration official — that aimed to help democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. this person said dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire new knowledge, a texas-based social media research firm, to work in alabama in support of jones during the special election in december 2017.
and the 20 pelosi-backing trump district democrats really fit into two camps. one camp come from places where trump performed more weakly than previous republican nominees: reps. tom o'halleran (ariz.), lucy mcbath (ga.), lauren underwood (ill.), haley stevens (mich.), angie craig (minn.), josh gottheimer (mass.) and kendra horn (okla.).
national security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. for example, military tension with china creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the u.s. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). in a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the u.s. the u.s. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the u.s. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).
the afghan war in particular could become a key campaign issue in the upcoming presidential cycle after a decade on the sidelines, and liberal democrats in the house may have more leeway to raise objections to u.s. military involvement under democratic leadership.
sept. 20 de blasio dropped out of presidential race.
d.c., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of dupont circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the uptown theater in cleveland park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of eighth street nw in penn quarter. (the closure of 18th street nw in adams morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. it was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.
as an example, suppose you're paying $90 a month for a single grandfathered unlimited plan on verizon, as this person does. (note: this is an actual verizon bill provided by a customer to the washington post. the customer provided it on the condition of anonymity to protect their personal financial information.)
i received the report in early 2018, which is when i first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics, dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.
their core concern is one that all american parents contend with: schools with standards that are inconsistent from district to district or state to state and that, in many instances, don't adequately prepare children for career or college. but what sets military families apart is that, by design, they are highly nomadic. our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many u.s. military installations. children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their k-12 years.
diresta, who also accepted a single share in aet and a seat on its board, said she became concerned with the opaqueness of the project, and severed ties with the company a few months after joining. she became research director at new knowledge in january 2018 but said that, while she had heard of an experiment in alabama, she did not know about the tactics.
some countries are seeing factories bounce back: manufacturers across europe ended 2020 on a high while asian factory activity expanded moderately thanks to robust demand in regional giant china, surveys showed, but the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs clouded the outlook for the recovery, reuters's jonathan cable and leika kihara manufacturers across europe ended 2020 on a high while asian factory activity expanded moderately thanks to robust demand in regional giant china, surveys showed, but the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs clouded the outlook for the recovery, reuters's jonathan cable and leika kihara report
the united kingdom has already announced it will prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose of an authorized vaccine, even if it means delaying the booster shot. limited data suggests the first vaccine dose may offer partial protection, and some prominent public health officials argue it's worth taking the risk to stem the spread of the virus.
a new assessment of several states with large military populations found that military families face a number of education obstacles, with the performance of students varying dramatically depending on geography. the lexington institute concluded that a shortage of high-quality educational programs for military-connected students, such as advanced placement classes in high school, often restricts educational opportunities, negatively impacts educational achievement, causes military families to make tough choices, inhibits quick assimilation into school communities, and can reduce a family's satisfaction with a military career.
plenty of that is going to happen behind the scenes, but we already know what many of the campaign benchmarks will be this year. the political calendar is slowly filling in, and the window for candidates to announce is fairly narrow; no one who went on to win his or her party's nomination in this century announced (or formed an exploratory committee) any later than april the year before the election.
gardner declined to identify the senators, but he said they include democrats and republicans who represent states that have legalized marijuana for medical and recreational purposes and states that are considering doing so.
turning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. the affordable care act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. the broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.
jonathon morgan, the chief executive of new knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the project birmingham document and disputed dickerson's claim that new knowledge authored it.
farewell to the little dance where a server brings you water and disappears; comes back to take your drink order and disappears; returns with cocktails, recites the specials and disappears while you decide on what to have for dinner. the pace of the evening is now in your hands. know what you want to drink? order as soon as you sit down, and you can sip while deciding what to snack on. anyone who's needed to make a quick exit because of a cranky child (or cranky adult who's had one too many), appreciates the ability to settle the bill instantly and quietly.
both sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue have proven loyal allies of the president. and the incumbents underlined the point this week as they defended the trump's push to overturn biden's victory in their state. perdue reacted to the news trump tried to bully georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger (r) into reversing the election outcome by condemning as disgusting the taping and releasing of their saturday conversation. and loeffler on monday declared she would join the dozen republican senators who have pledged to oppose certifying biden's electoral college win, repeating the pledge onstage with trump at a rally in dalton, ga.
nancy pelosi is once again the speaker of the house, returning to the job after eight years despite 15 members of her party not voting for her. what matters for 2020 is that 20 democrats in districts carried by the president backed the new speaker; republicans, who need to win at least 19 seats to flip the house, immediately painted targets on them.
slack goes down on first workday of the year: the popular workplace chat app confirmed monday that customers were experiencing trouble connecting to or using the platform but did not share details about the scope or markets affected. but according to the website downdetector, which displays outage reports in many metropolitan hubs, the disruption affected users throughout the united states, the united kingdom, brazil, france, japan and beyond, hamza shaban and rachel lerman the popular workplace chat app confirmed monday that customers were experiencing trouble connecting to or using the platform but did not share details about the scope or markets affected. but according to the website downdetector, which displays outage reports in many metropolitan hubs, the disruption affected users throughout the united states, the united kingdom, brazil, france, japan and beyond, hamza shaban and rachel lerman report
the document also describes project birmingham helping the unnamed write-in candidate gain new twitter followers — something watson recalls as well, with 10,000 suddenly appearing on his account. he also gained some exposure with the help of the operator of the facebook page, which the document claims acted as a media advisor helping to arrange interviews with news organizations. the document included an image of a dec. 5 washington post story on watson. the author of that piece, david weigel, said he does not recall anyone arranging interviews for his story.
the petition joins a bevy of others from groups representing telecom companies, wireless carriers, tech companies and advertisers.
all of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the federal reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. there is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. first, credit is already cheap. but more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.
i am not much for planning, partially because i don't want to tie myself down to being at a specific place at a set time weeks from now. (maybe that's an issue for a professional to address.) i am also a traditionalist who is opposed to reserved seating in bar areas, as well as at beer gardens and breweries. or at least i was.
there is public interest value in the preservation of those stories, said alex howard, a government transparency advocate who previously served as deputy director of the nonprofit sunlight foundation.
in the house, antiwar democrat rep. barbara lee of california will continue her efforts to repeal the 2001 military authorization she said has now been used or misused in more than two dozen instances far afield from the original invasion of afghanistan that it covered. she was the lone member of congress to vote against the authorization, days after the sept. 11 attacks.
these measures are making a difference. i am encouraged that we have received letters from our local community about improved chapter behavior in state college. local law enforcement and others report reduced crowd sizes at fraternity gatherings. fraternity and sorority leaders are working more closely with the university to implement the new safety programs. this is important progress.
after the central bank raised interest rates in december, trump asked advisers if it's possible to fire powell, an unprecedented move that many think isn't legally possible since a fed governor can only be removed for cause.
it is one of the idiosyncrasies of this moment that we are in where private companies are hosting public squares, howard said.
leading business lobbies in washington joined the chorus.
a study published in the journal clinical infectious diseases in january found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in u.s. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. the study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.
replace tips with mandatory 20 percent service charges.
and the report was critical of the school security program operated by broward county public schools. the report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, nikolas cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. it took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.
if you need to do some work on your laptop but there's no wifi, one option is to share your phone's data connection with your pc. if this is important to you, you may want to choose verizon or t-mobile because they offer a lot of tethering data. verizon's unlimited plan supports up to 10 gb of hotspot usage per month right out of the box, while t-mobile plans to make 10 gb of monthly hotspot data available to t-mobile one customers beginning friday.
maddie: i was freaking out all week — this is a little out of my comfort zone. i almost didn't come. but within 30 seconds, i was like, this is going to be absolutely fine.
it will ensure that this will be part of the 2020 presidential platforms, said jayapal. we will be looking at every single candidate from this lens.
the end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
but top government health officials dismiss the suggestion. leading infectious-disease expert anthony s. fauci, health and human services secretary alex azar and operation warp speed chief moncef slaoui have all recently roundly rejected proposals to alter the timeline of the two-dose vaccine regimen.
third on the list comes germany, with a trade surplus with the united states running at $59.6 billion in 2016. if trade is all that matters, perhaps, it should not have come as such a surprise to hear trump strike right at berlin's heart when called nato obsolete and argued that u.s. partners are not paying what they are supposed to be paying.
fidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power. but the uneven playing field creates a daunting obstacle to opposition victory at the ballot box.
adam: she asked for my time and i said i ran 2:43. she was astounded. i was like, nice, she's impressed!
one person who expressed a desire to fight back was dickerson, according to social media researcher renee diresta, who met him at a conference in chicago in the same month that trump was inaugurated. dickerson told her at the time about his desire to create a start-up to battle political disinformation, she said.
may 21: statewide primaries will take place in kentucky, one of three states that will elect a governor this year. in 2015, eventual democratic nominee jack conway spent the whole campaign evading questions about who he'd back for president, saying he would support joe biden, who was not running. why should a candidate for governor answer that question? it's fair to ask, but tying the democratic candidate to his national party has become a go-to tactic for republicans here. any democrat who wants to prove his or her strength outside of blue america will be paying attention.
a recent survey of current and former military personnel conducted by my organization, the collaborative for student success, along with the military times, a leading publication widely read by active duty and former u.s. military personnel, puts a finer point on the connection between the quality of k-12 education of military-connected children and readiness.
in those cases, bowser said, families that live no more than a half mile from a charter school should get special consideration through the city's school lottery system. the mayor said she wants to make it easier for more of our students to enroll in charter schools that are within walking distance of their home.
indicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of washington politics advise and consent, later made into a hit film directed by otto preminger. the book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. although advise and consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.
yellen added that growth is still likely to end up being above the growth rate of potential, which is consistent with a strong labor market and maybe even some further tightening.
that was for making the environment conducive to sign the deal, shaheen said. the taliban hopes to achieve a permanent solution to violence levels in afghanistan, but right now [there is] no such understanding of a cease-fire or reduction in violence.
bowser's proposal for a walkability preference would target an estimated 10,000 students who live more than a half mile away from their assigned traditional school but less than a half mile from a charter school. charter schools would not be required to offer an admission preference to those students, but they would be allowed to do so.
our zero tolerance rule for serious hazing is in place, and will result in the permanent revocation of recognition of any chapter found to have violated the university's requirements.
business interests covet the check a republican-controlled senate would provide on the incoming biden administration. but the version of the republican party many of them once called home — one that took fidelity to the constitution for granted — is critically endangered. that fact is exemplified by the chaos engulfing the gop as top party officials take sides over whether trump's evidence-free claims of massive voter fraud justify his attempt to subvert the vote.
nyse reverses move to delist chinese firms.
now the browns have another high-value pick to offer, even after amassing a war chest that includes two second-rounders this year and 11 selections altogether. they also have extra picks in 2018's fourth and sixth rounds.
maddie: a solid 3.5. i really, really liked talking to him. it didn't feel like a date totally for me, but it was a great night.
this week, senior administration officials are jetting around the middle east in a bid to assuage allies that the white house is still committed to their security interests. but so far, they're mostly betraying the discord within the administration over what comes next.
we're just going to have to work very hard, sen. chris van hollen (d-md.) said on the call with cardin, to increase the pressure on mitch mcconnell to hold that vote.
but really leveling the playing field often means more than inviting female ceos to speak, ortutay wrote. for starters, women and people of color are underrepresented in the tech industry, especially in leadership and technical roles. so, conference organizers might need to look harder, or be more flexible in who they invite to speak.
unemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now. we have inflation under control. i think that's a pretty good outcome, and we sure think it can continue, powell said, adding that he feels fine about capital markets.
warren's iowa adventure. since the massachusetts senator's last visit to iowa, in 2014, a few parts of the state have grown a bit bluer. there's a lot more of iowa that's gotten redder — and that's where warren will be going.
this is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the united kingdom, i've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. for those unfamiliar with the concept: you order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. when glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. repeat. no waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me. (dealing with people who duck out on rounds is a discussion for another time.)
this wasn't a radical new idea: annapolis closes busy west street for a weekly street festival each summer, and old town alexandria voted in 2019 to close a stretch of king street on weekends between april and october. but the dire situation facing restaurants and bars forced local jurisdictions to reconsider their priorities: diners enjoying a meal, a beer garden and entertainment outdoors were judged more important than drivers going a few blocks out of their way. with restaurants staring into a financial abyss, these models should continue for the foreseeable future. make outdoor dining the destination, whether that's tables with waterfront views in annapolis's historic downtown, or bethesda's food court-style tables, which let visitors choose from any nearby restaurant — perfect for the group who can't decide on one cuisine.
but that is not a significant change. the rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. the new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. the other promised changes have such large loopholes that pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the house floor.
one company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a saturday night. in a 2010 case in texas cited by the council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.
maddie: he was very kind and definitely excited to be there, which made me excited to be there.
in 1948, time magazine journalist whittaker chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that alger hiss, a former state department official, was a member of his cell. while chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.
the result: over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. as the military child education coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality. military parents are often left to make career-related decisions based on keeping kids in schools they are comfortable with or moving their families and placing kids in unfamiliar schools where they might wind up either ahead of or behind their new classmates.
both ossoff and warnock have said they want to expand health insurance incrementally through broadening the affordable care act and creating a government-backed public option plan for americans, rather than overhauling the whole system with medicare-for-all or something like it.
lee would not on speculate whether a majority of her colleagues would support a renewal of that authorization now. but congressional leaders of both parties have long avoided the question in large part out of concern that a no vote would undermine the president and existing military missions.
aug. 23 moulton dropped out of presidential race.
bolton, meanwhile, was in israel over the weekend and will later head to turkey, where he'll be accompanied by jeffrey — the syria envoy — and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. seemingly contradicting trump, bolton told reporters that no withdrawal from syria will take place until the islamist militants are fully defeated and turkey guarantees the safety of syrian kurdish units allied with the united states but considered terrorist enemies by ankara.
congress counts the electoral college votes, the final step in the 2020 presidential election
mehlhorn said he too was unaware of key details about project birmingham, but he defended the idea of learning from the russian disinformation operatives at the internet research agency, who backed trump in the 2016 election and in his first year in the white house, according to u.s. officials.
diresta briefly advised aet, offering technical guidance and helping them meet potential supporters in the months before hoffman agreed to fund the company.
house chamber and democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the house. since the november elections, pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. that included creating a leadership position for rep. barbara lee; reviving the house administration subcommittee on elections for rep. marcia l. fudge to chair; and promising the problem solvers caucus, a group within the house that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.
bipartisan immigration talks in the house have produced little visible progress. a bipartisan group of moderates, the problem solvers caucus, created an immigration task force that formed the outlines of a deal, said rep. mike coffman (r-colo.), one of the participants, but the larger caucus wouldn't sign on.
but in massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, u.s. attorney andrew lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws congress has already passed, and that i will not do.
nearly 200 senior executives signed on to a letter leaning on lawmakers to certify biden's win in the most significant push yet to ensure trump's assault on the election outcome falls short, josh dawsey reports. signers included a wide array of executives of fortune 500 companies, from the leaders of banks, airlines, investment firms, pharmaceutical companies, professional sports leagues, real estate conglomerates, top law firms and media companies.
more than one-third of respondents, 35 percent, said dissatisfaction with a child's education was or is a significant factor in deciding whether to continue military service; 40 percent said they either have declined or would decline a career-advancing job at a different military installation to remain at their current military facility because of high performing schools. when asked, did moving between states as part of your military service add challenges to your children's education, 70 percent answered yes.
national greek organizations absolutely must assume leadership responsibility. three chapters that lost university recognition, alpha chi rho, alpha sigma phi and sigma alpha mu, did not receive chapter suspensions from their national offices. that is unacceptable.
indeed, in its treatment of folks around town — from the mousy-but-competent workers such as barbara minerva (kristen wiig) who get lost in the bureaucracy that employs them to the full-of-themselves donors and interns who operate the shadow economy that keeps d.c.'s institutions running — ww84 has a lot in common with shattered glass, billy ray's movie about the fabulist stephen glass, who almost took down the new republic. that movie captured the sociology of d.c., with its weird mélange of poor pay, idealism and naked ambition in the service of jockeying for social position, in a way that few others have managed. like that movie, ww84 shows how washington's institutions and mores leave it at risk of being corrupted.
when we think about the future of our city, we see less single-occupancy vehicle trips, more vehicle electrification and an emphasis on building the infrastructure and policy framework to support those goals, jeff marootian, director of the district department of transportation, told my colleague. for instance, the city added electric buses to its circulator fleet and has started a push to convert more than 75,000 streetlights into leds that save energy, according to marootian.
indivisible, the progressive grass-roots network of citizen groups, said it will focus its efforts on six democratic senators from left-leaning states — gary peters and debbie stabenow of michigan, martin heinrich and tom udall of new mexico and tim kaine and mark r. warner of virginia. kaine, stabenow and heinrich face reelection this year.
policy analyst adam staveski, 22, and financial analyst maddie csere, also 22, are fresh-faced and fresh out of local colleges, enjoying their first year as d.c. young professionals. we sent them to maple in columbia heights to see if a shared love of running, economics and a laid-back attitude was enough to spark a fresh romance.
you shouldn't be enduring this, sen. benjamin l. cardin (d-md.) said during a conference call friday with federal union leaders and members. this is truly a shutdown [that] makes no sense whatsoever. government should be open, should never have closed.
but criticism of the pact came from trump's former white house team.
one fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the george w. bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.
the 19th amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. the 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.
there was a feeling after the trump election that democrats hadn't prioritized tech, that republicans had built this amazing juggernaut machine, said diresta. the right wing was running a meme war, and there were these crazy dirty tricks. people wanted to build countermeasures.
republican and campaign officials said among the steps that could be taken to punish romney are continued attacks on twitter or through paid advertisements. trump allies could also help fund an opponent in his state, although he's not up for reelection until 2024, or push operatives or donors not to support or work for him. white house officials could block policy or budget priorities that romney wants, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.
the move will likely spur house democrats to propose legislation expanding health coverage as a specific coronavirus response. rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) has already introduced legislation along these lines, proposing a bill to expand medicare and medicaid during the pandemic.
most of warren's events are being promoted as organizing gatherings, as opposed to policy listening tour stops of the sort clinton made in 2015. one is a roundtable in storm lake, a city in buena vista county, but iowa democrats point out that there's a unique local story there.
the program also stands to improve the lives of snap recipients who do not have cars and who may have to walk miles to a grocery store. and while come critics of the program might wonder about recipients' access to the internet, wonkblog's rachel premack reported in july that connectivity is less of a problem than transportation:
it sounds like the broncos want to have their cake and eat it, too, getting romo without giving up anything to the cowboys in return. that may prove impossible, as dallas is well aware of the highly valuable commodity of which it is in possession, given the nfl's perpetual shortage of quality starting quarterbacks.
here's a look at the dreamers whose daca protections are set to expire. (jenny starrs/the washington post)
march 10-13: the annual international association of fire fighters conference comes to d.c., and the first day typically takes place in a ballroom near the capitol, with prominent politicians invited to speak on any topic to members. the union's longtime president harold schaitberger has already all but pledged to back joe biden if he enters the race.
mid-september: the new hampshire democratic party holds its convention in manchester, giving candidates the biggest captive audience they'll have in that state until the new year.
the white house did not receive an advance notice of romney's decision, though some aides were preparing for the idea that he would go against the president.
our greek-letter community needs to embrace the need for change and rededicate yourselves to a mission of service and community. we must do better.
over the past three decades, i have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. if we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal.
aug. 22 inslee dropped out of presidential race.
dickerson: when i talked to republicans on the hill, they wonder, what in the white house -- what have you all learned from this experience with the executive order?
the fed recently cut its forecast for growth in 2019 to 2.3 percent (down from 2.5 percent) as concerns grow about the stock market correction and the slowdown in china and europe dragging down the u.s. economy. but fed leaders still insist that is above trend and very healthy growth.
june 20 added bullock and de blasio's positions based on surveys returned from their campaigns. added several positions for castro, gabbard, hickenlooper and inslee based on response from the campaigns.
hearing from rank-and-file feds might give trump a better idea of the difficulties they are facing and a more realistic sense of their views on being locked out of their jobs and required to work with no guarantee of pay. payday this friday is in grave danger of disappearing.
u.s. and taliban negotiators were close to signing a peace deal in september, but the effort was scuttled by trump after an attack by the taliban killed a u.s. soldier.
brexit forces bankers to shift trading of european stocks: the fallout from britain's split from the european union showed itself on the first trading day of the year as a big chunk of dealing volume in eu stocks moved from london to venues located in amsterdam, paris and the continent's other financial centers, the wsj's ben dummett reports.
today can be the moment of overcoming the past, he said.
jan. 13 booker dropped out of presidential race.
across much of europe, top officials echoed these sentiments. british prime minister boris johnson called the scenes of chaos disgraceful.
however, holding on to romo while waiting for just the perfect moment to deal him to another team that suddenly finds itself with a need at his position, as the eagles did in trading sam bradford to the vikings just before the regular season started, could prove problematic for the cowboys. beginning with offseason training activities in the spring, every day that romo spends with the team will provide opportunities for reporters to ask him, owner jerry jones and everyone else in dallas how they feel about the awkward situation.
ashlee strong, a ryan spokeswoman, said he was continuing to speak with lawmakers in both chambers but isn't committed to permitting a vote on a bill granting dreamers a path to citizenship.
sanders said he would urge congress to reject any deal that increases military spending by more than what is spent on domestic programs. if we're going to spend a dollar more in the military, we must spend a dollar more on the enormously important issues facing working families. all of these issues are in crisis mode, and they have to be dealt with right now.
adam: it seems like everyone hates georgetown, but it's like [american] is rivals with [gwu], jockeying for position as the second-best school in d.c.
— huawei punished two employees for wishing people a happy new year via the company's twitter account with an iphone, according to reuters's sijia jiang. the tweet was marked: via twitter for iphone.
a spokeswoman for goodlatte declined to comment.
if a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. it is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.
adam: both of us were surprised by the time we left that we'd been there so long.
eliot a. cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for foreign affairs, the president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of u.s. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the united states has sustained for nearly eight decades. he explains, the real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the united states should accept a more modest role in world affairs.
national association of manufacturers ceo jay timmons said disappointment in the election outcome does not justify harming our democracy or undermining faith in our elections based on unproven charges and conspiracy theories… now we ask congress to join us in healing our nation, instead of fostering more division and vitriol.
no surprise, then, that trump took less than 10 seconds into the first presidential debate to slam china for devaluing its currency and stealing american jobs.
there's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.
the report starts with this warning:
so you take a look at other countries, pakistan is there, they should be fighting. but russia should be fighting, the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called russia again as opposed to the soviet union.
they join a handful of industry titans who have backed the republicans on an entirely different scale by giving to the senate leadership fund, the mitch mcconnell-affiliated super pac. blackstone group co-founder stephen schwarzman gave that group $15 million on nov. 12, the same day citadel founder ken griffin forked over $10 million.
given that siemian and lynch are both playing on rookie contracts, the broncos should be able to accommodate romo's salary, which will be $14 million next year, after which he will have two more seasons left on a six-year, $108 million contract. the website spotrac lists denver as having $38,410,833 in 2017 salary-cap space, and teams can usually find ways of freeing up more room when necessary.
no democrats voted to acquit the president, leaving romney as the only senator to break with his party.
but when servers who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing both a decline in tips and a rise in sexual harassment, should we really be leaving an employee's rent money in the hands of people who ask servers to remove their masks before deciding to add or subtract a few bucks? of course not.
the position is further than other potential 2020 candidates have gone so far, but could open the door for other democrats calling for a reconsideration of the u.s. mandate in afghanistan.
but a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.
the idea that she would announce this is astonishing to me and it completely undermines the purpose of a task force, ernst said.
june 30: the end of the second fundraising quarter, which can be a winnowing moment for candidates who have not yet shown any ability to stack money.
pelosi's entrenchment echoes that of boehner (2011-2015): the ohio republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every gop house member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.
elusive $2,000 checks are among the items being considered: rep. hakeem jeffries (d-n.y.), chairman of the house democratic caucus, said that the $2,000 checks amount to 'unfinished business that should be continued as part of our effort to provide additional relief to the american people,' erica werner reports.
jan. 18-21: the afl-cio will hold its dr. martin luther king jr. civil and human rights conference, which is open to 2020 contenders; there's little buzz about this so far, but it has the potential to be the democrats' first cattle call, and the afl-cio has the clout to call democrats in whenever it wants.
from heidi shierholz, policy director at the economic policy institute:
with most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, prime minister boris johnson said monday. in england, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.
(monica akhtar,erin patrick o'connor/the washington post)
in our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. these autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.
dec. 2 bullock dropped out of presidential race.
eboni-rose thompson, the chair of the ward 7 education council, said she fears the changes would mean less access to high-quality schools. in ward 7, for example, there are no dual-language charter schools. most of those schools are in wards 1 and 4. under the proposal, some students in ward 1 might have greater access to those schools because they live near them. that would leave fewer seats available for students from ward 7.
but all those who have acknowledged playing a role in project birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.
a spokeswoman for kaine, whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, said he will keep pushing for a solution for dreamers and he'll evaluate a deal once he's seen it.
maddie: i hugged him and then we left. he texted me that night to make sure i got home okay.
the other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in u.s.-china relations is probably here to stay, as long as trump sticks around in the white house.
those accounts were later suspended by twitter. the post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the alabama election describing evidence that russian bots were supporting moore. the project birmingham document cited an article in the new york post with the headline roy moore flooded with fake russian twitter followers.
and the business roundtable, representing its roster of fortune 200 ceos, said it opposes efforts to delay or overturn the clear outcome of the election. with our country in the midst of a pandemic, business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs.
my research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. i support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.
parties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. as a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.
in a second online effort against moore, progressive democratic operatives posed as conservatives on facebook and twitter and claimed to be part of a dry alabama movement that supported the republican candidate, according to the new york times's scott shane and alan blinder. the times reported that the democratic operatives thought associating mr. moore with calls for a statewide alcohol ban would hurt him with moderate, business-oriented republicans and help jones.
to that end, as we approach the one-year anniversary of a terrible tragedy we must do more:
it also said every school should have a code red plan for emergencies and should train staff to execute that plan and communicate it to everyone at the school.
over the past year, the university instituted extensive new measures , which depart significantly from the greek system's self-governance model. we are making progress:
loeffler and perdue personify the challenge facing right-leaning business leaders uncomfortable with the party's trajectory.
aug. 8-18: it's the most cliche-rich event in politics: the iowa state fair. it's also a focusing event for candidates, who are given time at a des moines register-sponsored soapbox to deliver their stump speech.
to that end, writers patty jenkins (who also directed) and geoff johns introduce maxwell lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. where previous entries in the dc expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and wonder woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane you can't always get what you want or be careful what you wish for.
but the initiative is ending with little to show for its efforts, as health-care costs continued to grow in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. a spokesperson for haven said that amazon, berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan chase would continue to leverage insights gained from the joint-venture. (amazon ceo jeff bezos owns the washington post).
it's a stark shift from the ambitious announcement of the group's creation three years ago by amazon's jeff bezos, jpmorgan's jamie dimon and berkshire's warren buffett … haven demonstrated plenty of ambition when it debuted in 2018. at the time, the three prominent executives put their names behind the effort, garnering massive media coverage for their efforts to address one of the most intractable challenges in corporate america. reducing costs was a primary objective. (bezos owns the washington post.)
if you stream lots of music or video over 3g or 4g lte, then you may want to consider an unlimited plan. but which service to choose? here's our side-by-side comparison of all the major carriers' offerings. we'll highlight particular points of interest below, but consider this a starting point.
the denver post's mark kiszla recently asked in a column advocating the acquisition of romo, can denver really afford to waste another year of this championship defense with a young quarterback not ready for prime time? gary kubiak tried that bluff this year, and it ended with ugly shouting in a locker room divided by the frustration of seven losses.
as dawsey notes, schwarzman didn't sign the ceo letter on monday, but jonathan gray, the firm's president and chief operating officer, did.
evidence also supports the document's claims about creating a conservative facebook page to siphon support away from moore. in a section headed splitting republican votes, the document says that a facebook page created by project birmingham had contact with a republican write-in candidate beginning on nov. 18, 2017, and later endorsed this candidate, who was not named.
haven, created two years ago by amazon, jpmorgan chase and berkshire hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website monday that it will shutter, the post's jay greene reports.
teachers went to school to teach. that is their expertise. law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage a threat. unfortunately, that didn't happen on 2/14, but i still think we should leave it in the hands of law enforcement.
this could make it easier for the lower chamber to pass bills related to the coronavirus pandemic and send them over to the senate, putting pressure on that body to approve them.
steven levitsky is a professor of government at harvard university.
during the 2016 campaign, then-candidate donald trump sent mixed signals on the issue.
it's an opaque process. vietnam has a collective four pillar leadership structure made up of general secretary, prime minister, president and chair of the national assembly, the nation's parliament. it governs in consultation with a 17- to 19-member politburo. nguyen phu trong, the current general secretary, also became president in 2018 following the death of president tran dai quang, meaning the top leadership was down to three. observers anticipate the government will revert to four pillars in 2021.
although burgess was openly gay and mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. nonetheless, pressure from the fbi over the burgess affair led the british government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the foreign service, and media portrayed martin and mitchell as lovers.
since then, khalilzad has sought confidence-building measures to bring both sides back to the table. in november, the taliban released two western hostages in exchange for the release of senior militants linked to the taliban by the afghan government. and over the last week, both sides reduced violence nationwide.
i've always considered this a top-priority issue, lee said in an interview. it's a blank check to use force anywhere in the world.
parties face a dilemma when writing rules. if the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the rules committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. but if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.
june 11 included two additional stances for moulton and made two changes for buttigieg, following guidance from their campaigns.
that itinerary has turned some heads in iowa. i'm excited that with so many people focused on des moines and urban areas, that she's coming out here, said j.d. scholten, a democrat who narrowly lost to king last year. she's going to hear about health care. she's going to talk to people who are worried about market consolidation and how farmers are being squeezed, both on the input side and the output side.
indeed, he implicitly argues, why should the united states be bearing a disproportionate burden of the cost of the north atlantic treaty organization when, as he suggested in a recent interview, germany is just another one of those countries being very unfair to the u.s.?
aug. 15 hickenlooper dropped out of presidential race.
democracy requires a level playing field
with bar patios operating at a fraction of their capacity, an increasing number of establishments began to offer the ability to make reservations. in addition to higher-end destinations, i've made them for low-key neighborhood spots, like all souls and trusty's, where i've always just been happy to take my chances walking in and standing around until a seat opened up. and you know what? having a guaranteed seat has been a godsend.
the two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.
following the signing ceremony in doha, shaheen, the taliban spokesman, told the post that the taliban is committed to the deal, but that doesn't mean violence levels will remain low in afghanistan.
feb. 3 bloomberg's campaign noted that he supports repealing the mexico city policy.
children from oyster adams elementary walk to their school. a new policy aims at giving parents more choices to enroll students in charter schools within walking distance of their homes. (kate patterson for the washington post) (kate patterson/for the washington post)
on dec. 19, the university held a signing ceremony with 70 greek organization leaders representing 49 chapters and the four governing councils . . . acknowledging the expectations that the university has for its greek organizations and members.
moreover, it never seemed to cross the minds of intelligence professionals like roscoe hillenkoetter or the senators questioning him that a gay person was by necessity someone skilled at keeping secrets in a homophobic society and therefore might actually be predisposed for espionage work.
when asked friday if he would step down if trump asked, powell said simply, no.
it's likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018, bernanke said. this is not something that is news. we've anticipated this for a long time because it was clear the stimulus would be dying down over time.
pelosi led a congressional delegation to afghanistan in march last year. our meetings confirmed that afghanistan has come a long way with the support of the u.s. and other international partners but formidable challenges remain, she said at the time.
i'm glad mitt is a republican, said sen. kevin cramer (r-n.d.). senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said he was surprised and disappointed with romney's vote but said the utah republican was largely supportive of the president.
trump told advisers in recent weeks that he was more worried about sens. susan collins (r-maine) and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) than romney, according to people who heard his comments. in the end, collins and murkowski voted with the president.
and while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — ronald reagan, the architect of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, would have been unlikely to use maxwell lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. i will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of israel defense forces vet gadot taking apart the egyptian king of crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.
maddie: we align a bit [politically], but my family is a little divided, so i was talking about how growing up in rural michigan gives me a different perspective.
adam: we both grew up in small-town environments [and] came to d.c. for college.
if trump talked to more federal employees, he would hear stories from people like katherine scheflen, a lawyer in the justice department's civil rights division. she needs her check on time. i am a single mother of two disabled children. i live paycheck to paycheck, as do many americans, she said. it is not complicated — if i miss a paycheck, i cannot pay my mortgage and my other bills. it is as simple as that.
with 50 seats and a tie-breaking vote from harris, senate democrats would have to get every single one of their members in line — or nab the help of some republicans to pass legislation. and unless there's a budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass, they'd need 60 votes to get around any filibusters.
people's claims have been held up for months at times for something as simple as a typo or uploading a scan of a driver's license instead of a photo. most delays are the result of three key factors: extensive fraud prevention checks, antiquated computer systems and applications being flagged for extra scrutiny. claims set aside for manual review often take months to resolve.
legitimizing taliban sends the wrong signal to isis and al-qaeda terrorists, and to america's enemies generally, bolton wrote in a tweet.
compared with the price of one of the new verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. so switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. because the customer used only about 7.9 gb of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to verizon's 8 gb plan. but that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.
trump has accused german chancellor angela merkel of ruining the country with her immigration policy, and the two leaders clearly have a very different worldview. but perhaps trade is the real root of trump's distrust of germany.
maddie: he's a really good runner. i recently ran a marathon for the first time; he ran the marine corps in an insane time and is running [in] boston next year.
the senator said he had not slept past 4 a.m. since the senate impeachment trial began last month, wrestling over how he should vote, and eventually decided to buck the president because he saw the evidence that trump pressured the leader of ukraine to investigate his political rivals as overwhelming.
he's not someone who operates from a center of fear. i don't think it had anything to do with his decision, said stuart stevens, a former adviser to romney and a critic of trump. he tried to look at this as if, what would he do if a democrat was in office? he wanted to be a true juror. he took it very seriously. i think mitt romney will sleep very well tonight.
there really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, fauci, who directs the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said monday. fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.
my attitude did not change after i began working in a mine closer to home just outside clintwood, va. the company i worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. but the problem was still apparent. we would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
most states have adopted centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. but states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.
adam: there seemed to be depth to her. she's not predictable. we delved briefly into politics, and rather than being a staunch partisan, she's able to look at situations with a lot of nuance, more so than a lot of people in the d.c. area.
french scientists stands-by world's oldest person jeanne calment:
the deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which u.s., afghan and taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. the agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue. instead, it notes that a cease-fire would need to be agreed upon in intra-afghan talks that are expected to start in 10 days.
this openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the cold war inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. the specter of a homosexual international, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful communist one. a series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.
adam: she's very genuine. i'm like, wow, you are a cool, amazing, interesting person that i'm excited to talk to.
at year-end vietnam had one of the lowest virus death counts globally, having contained the pathogen. however, economic growth slowed to 2.91% at the end of 2020 as the global downturn brought on by the pandemic sapped demand for made-in-vietnam products, from smartphones to dress shirts. the government forecasts a 2021 expansion of about 6% compared with 7.02% in 2019.
bernie sanders. the new york times published the most comprehensive investigation so far of allegations of sexual harassment against staffers in the senator's 2016 campaign, an issue that had been bubbling under the surface for months. sanders, who dislikes discussing scandal or campaign details more than most politicians, appeared on cnn on wednesday and said that he supported changes in harassment reporting policy; then, he added that he was a little busy on the trail and thus unaware of the details as harassment was reported.
still, it's not all bad, and wonder woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. unlike many hollywood productions, the movie uses actual d.c. locations for both interior and exterior shots. watching wonder woman stride through the iconic smithsonian national museum of natural history's entry and take a resurrected steve on a tour of d.c.'s metro system gave the picture a genuine washington flair so often absent from movies like this. big setpieces that take place on actual washington streets in sight of the capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the reflecting pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.
little punch. move on. it's over, one senior campaign official said, to describe the strategy. we were already done with him.
the bad first: ww84 is scattershot and nonsensical, seemingly designed solely around a desire to get pilot steve trevor, who died in the first film, back for a second go-round, even if that means negating his heroic sacrifice.
all of our students, as adults, must recognize the importance of safety and make changes in your own lives that will create a safer community.
rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), chairman of the house freedom caucus, said it was essential that house republicans pass a stand-alone immigration bill that promotes conservative priorities in line with trump's agenda.
the advantages of an uneven playing field
even the relative calm in afghanistan over the past week — a precondition for the peace deal signing — was thrown into question.
5. how has covid-19 affected the country?
you can talk about our generals. i gave our generals all the money they wanted. they didn't do such a great job in afghanistan, trump said during a cabinet meeting wednesday that was open to reporters. they've been fighting in afghanistan for 19 years.
we also continue to work with pennsylvania and federal legislators toward stricter hazing penalties. in short, we will not rest in our efforts, with the hope that this kind of tragedy never occurs again.
the fed chair said that he hasn't spoken with trump, although powell indicated he would be willing to meet with the president. i can't think of any fed chairs who didn't eventually meet with the president, powell said while seated alongside yellen and bernanke.
first, here's the analysis, in robb's own words:
it's more than just watching 'house of cards,' powell said. he's hoping faster broadband speeds will enable innovations in fields like healthcare, where the technology could enable new ways to process medical images and videos. powell's comments come as 5g , the fifth generation of cell networks technology, is setting the agenda at ces. powell tells me every evolution in the mobile networks needs to be met with new technology in broadband networks. the country critically needs both, powell said.
you must account for privacy if you're going to have security. but some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. instead, users must electronically fetch the program from intel's web site. in addition, the utility program is available only for windows software. -those who use the linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the world wide web – in essence, allowing businesses at those web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other web sites. the default for privacy should be no id number, said david banisar, policy director for the electronic privacy information center, a advocacy group in washington that helped organize the intel boycott. rep. edward j. markey (d-mass. ), ranking member of the commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. i have great concerns about any unique identifier web sites might use without any rules, said markey, who wrote a letter to intel complaining about the chip last week. © copyright the washington post company back to the top
hawks in the washington establishment have cheered trump's apparent about-face. i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out, said sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.), telling cbs's face the nation that the bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for reevaluating what he's doing. ... he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.
nibbles: democratic operatives and a research firm who played a role in an online effort to influence a 2017 u.s. senate race in alabama to help elect democrat doug jones are distancing themselves from the initiative's most controversial tactics that were inspired by russian disinformation, according to the washington post's craig timberg, tony romm, aaron c. davis and elizabeth dwoskin.
we instituted our new deferred recruitment policy. now, new students may not rush a sorority or fraternity until they have completed a full semester. many sorority students report that waiting to rush this past semester was helpful, because they adjusted to academic and social life on campus, and are now better prepared to consider participation in greek life.
in a nutshell, robb argues that trade — rather than national security — dominates trump's foreign policy thinking, inverting decades of u.s. practice. by implication, that makes any country running a large trade surplus with the united states a direct competitor.
i suspect that donors and operatives are not going to be allowed to play both sides of the field. they are going to have to choose, said andrew surabian, a republican strategist and adviser to donald trump jr. he is going to be considered a pariah moving forward.
there's actually a spirited disagreement among republicans about whether this attack works; rep. tom emmer (r-minn.), the new chair of the national republican congressional committee, has worried that the obsessive focus on pelosi in 2018 did little to boost republicans outside of very safe districts.
adam: i would say the overall vibe was more friendly than flirtatious. it's hard on a first date to really give out too strong of a signal without it being weird.
the dearth of jobs is the result of a domino effect: many people stayed away from hospital emergency rooms this past year, wary of contracting the virus. as patient numbers dropped, emergency departments brought in less money. as a result, cash-strapped employers stopped recruiting new doctors, ben writes.
the rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the cold war was twofold. the first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. so shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.
on the one hand, boosting growth in the export-dependent nation following a sharp global recession. on the other, doing so without further upsetting the u.s., its biggest export market. the u.s. put vietnam on notice in october by opening a trade investigation into its currency policy and then imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties on vietnamese car and truck tires, citing an undervalued currency. in december, the u.s. treasury designated the southeast asian country a currency manipulator, which comes with no immediate penalties but can escalate trade tensions. vietnam's authorities will be keen to secure greater access to american consumers while tamping down concerns about the surging trade surplus, on pace in 2020 to break the previous year's record $56 billion.
gordon arthur cyril stewart was born in the jamaican capital kingston on july 6, 1941. his father had been brought to jamaica from england as a baby and became a radio maintenance technician at the state-run jamaica broadcasting corp., while his mother ran an appliance dealership.
democrats anticipate writing a new relief bill once biden is sworn in jan. 20. its contours are uncertain, however, and the path forward will depend on the outcome of the georgia runoff elections … aid to state and local governments, left out of the most recent relief bill, remains a top priority for democrats. house speaker nancy pelosi said sunday that 'we owe them more.'
by 10, he was obsessed by the sea and soon began to find any ways to make money. from a tree trunk, he built himself a dugout canoe; later he bought a bigger boat, caught fish and sold it to local hotels. he also learned he could make decent bucks by taking wealthy visitors from their yachts to shore and back.
in 2012, a 12-member d.c. task force considered whether to require all charter schools to offer a neighborhood preference, but the idea was rejected.
instead of the saber-rattling, let's get in a room and figure out reasonable, sound policy for securing the border, helping [dreamers] . . . and solving this problem for the first time in two decades, sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.), a lead gop immigration negotiator, told fox news channel on sunday.
tipping is a difficult topic. it's a vestige of reconstruction-era discrimination that, according to study after study, perpetuates racism, sexism and ageism in dining rooms. but restaurant owners are loath to raise menu prices to the point where tipping isn't necessary to pay staff a real wage, because customers have become used to low, tip-subsidized prices. some customers seem to really enjoy the feeling of power they have over restaurant and bar workers, mentally dinging percentage points off a tip if the steak isn't medium-rare or the wine glasses aren't topped up every time.
the 13th national party congress is scheduled to be held jan. 25 through feb. 2. about 1,600 delegates from across the country will vote to select about 200 members to the central committee, which in turn will pick the politburo and from that group the party general secretary. the politburo will then nominate candidates for prime minister and the cabinet. these will go to a vote in the national assembly mid-year.
i live pay check to pay check like nearly all of my coworkers, and i'm scared that with losing weeks of income and my healthcare benefits, one family medical emergency for myself, my children, or my grandchildren during donald trump's shut down could make us homeless, said lisa earle in a statement provided by unite here, which represents the smithsonian worker. it's not fair that politicians playing games put me out of work, and it's even worse that my coworkers and i may never get back pay for the shutdown when we're just as impacted as all other federal workers.
mid-june: mitt romney's annual donor summit is expected to celebrate its fifth year in park city, utah, — the first, obviously, with the host representing the state as a senator. there will be several moments when republicans ask (or the press prods them to ask) if the party can go into 2020 with trump still leading it; this will be the most scenic of those moments.
in kabul, u.s. defense secretary mark t. esper said there is real hope for peace in afghanistan, but he warned the taliban to meet its obligations under the deal.
in short, at a time when we should fortify alliances, enhance diplomacy, bolster foreign aid, draw clear distinctions between democracies and authoritarians, and expand trade, we are doing the opposite, which merely encourages the go-it-alone voices on the right and the we-can-do-no-good-anyway voices on the left.
neither polling data nor actual election results suggest that embracing medicare for all or the broader progressive agenda hurt democratic politicians in 2018, data for progress concludes in the memo.
march 2 klobuchar dropped out of the presidential race.
april 8 sanders and gabbard dropped out of the presidential race.
antwan wilson, the incoming chancellor of dcps, starts his new job wednesday.
maddie: i went to [george washington university] and he went to american university; we talked about d.c. school rivalries.
leading a group of investors, he also bought the national airline air jamaica in 1994, expanding its routes beyond the caribbean to destinations including the united states and the united kingdom. the airline continued to lose money, however, and after mr. stewart and his group pulled out in 2004, it bounced between state and private control until it went out of business in 2015.
this offers greater flexibility, but for those who constantly stream at full hd, there are other risks to consider. use too much data (more than 28 gb in a month) and t-mobile may decide to slow down your connection.
warren, a member of the senate armed services committee, told interviewer rachel maddow that after 17 years of war there remain lots of different problems in afghanistan, and what seems to be the answer from the foreign policy establishment? 'stay forever.' that is not a policy. we can't do that.
some may judge me for not turning people in. but before i rushed to judgment, i considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.
a few years ago i might have said, 'no, no [to ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  murdoch said. but the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: it was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.
sept. 2: multiple primary states will be holding labor day events; the afl-cio's breakfast in new hampshire has frequently become a go-to event for democrats that day. (sanders has attended it every year since 2016.)
under the deal, the afghan government must assemble a negotiating team that will work with the taliban to agree on the makeup of the country's new government. the peace deal stipulates that those talks must begin by march 10.
left-wing activists will step up their advocacy for medicare-for-all in the coming days, with rallies for the policy around the jan. 19 women's march. moveon is also about to distribute a memo, written by data for progress, that crunched data from the 2018 election to argue that democrats running on the policy were not effectively attacked for it by republicans.
the dow closed down more than 300 points: it was a rocky first trading day of the year for wall street as stocks fell sharply and investors grew worried about the the pandemic and the economic recovery in 2021, cnn business's anneken tappe reports.
vietnam depends on china for key materials and equipment to supply its factories. yet relations with its powerful neighbor -- the two countries fought a brief border war in 1979 -- are fraught and further inflamed because of competing territorial claims in the south china sea. (vietnam's coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, or 2,100 miles, follows one of the world's busiest sea cargo lanes.) vietnam favors greater u.s. economic and military presence in the region to counter china's growing might and is expected to push for a close relationship with the biden administration.
it should be a no-brainer. mcconnell called the house approval a time-wasting act of political posturing, even though the house followed the lead of his republican-controlled senate.
mr. stewart, 79, died jan. 4 in miami, according to his son adam stewart, who now takes over the sandals resorts international empire and who did not give a specific cause of death. he did say that his father had received a recent medical diagnosis but had kept it quiet so as not to worry his friends or workers. in may last year he had donated $31.5 million to jamaican authorities to help families suffering from the coronavirus.
but these stories no longer exist on their instagram accounts — and howard says the public shouldn't have to simply rely on journalists or other observers to screenshot them for posterity. ocasio-cortez's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on her use of social media or whether they were archiving the ephemeral stories in any way.
pelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power
an earlier version of this story incorrectly described a man sitting at the desk of house speaker nancy pelosi. the story has been updated to correct that the man was sitting at the desk of a member of pelosi's staff.
enemies of democracy will be happy to see these unbelievable pictures from #washingtondc. riotous words turn into violent acts — on the steps of the reichstag, and now in the #capitol, german foreign minister heiko maas tweeted, referring to far-right protesters who rushed the historic german parliament building in august. the disdain for democratic institutions is devastating.
only the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers nicholas longworth (r), 1925-1931, and sam rayburn (d), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. with leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as charles halleck (r), 1959-1965; frederick gillett (r) 1919-1925; and john mccormack (d) 1962-1971.
we're putting our own lives at risk, our family's lives at risk, emergency medicine physician r.j. sontag, the president of the emergency medicine residents' association, told the post. we're in, frankly, a financially precarious position with a ton of debt and limited income. and the fact of the matter is that employers just aren't hiring.
feb. 11 bennet and yang dropped out of presidential race.
the surge of reactions from allies and foreign observers illustrated one of the trump era's key consequences, which has become only more apparent as it winds to a chaotic close: the beleaguered but persistent role of the united states as a model for democratic norms and institutions — in its own self-conception and in the eyes of friends — has been severely tarnished.
feb. 26 bloomberg's campaign said he supports health coverage for undocumented immigrants, with a caveat.
the sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. never in american history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. the more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist joe alsop in 1957. when the kgb entrapped him having sex with another man in a moscow hotel room, alsop marched straight to the american embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across washington, alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the soviet regime.
but at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use. at one time, smoking was accepted almost everywhere, and now it's not. and people are no longer shy about asking others to put out the cigarette. hersman said she hopes that eventually, more americans will no longer view texting while driving as acceptable behavior, either.
what could happen next? north carolina republicans, who now say that harris should be seated, are sticking with him and filing lawsuits on his behalf, attempting to move the matter to federal court. but if they lose there, a law passed by the republican-run legislature would mandate any vacancy to be filled in a special election, preceded by a primary. one potential timeline: both parties pick their nominees in a late spring primary, then elect a new congressman as late as november.
officials will stick with the current vaccine regimen: in recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, carolyn y. johnson in recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, carolyn y. johnson reports
fears about gay americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the cold war. previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. in 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, roscoe hillenkoetter, the first director of the central intelligence agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. nonetheless, hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.
he told fox news host bill o'reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. but as he was campaigning in colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, trump said in an interview with denver's kusa: i think it's up to the states, yeah. i'm a states person. i think it should be up to the states, absolutely.
but it's now far from clear when — or even if — the panic-inducing drawdown will take place. trump seemed chastened by the backlash in washington and extended his initial 30-day deadline for the pullout to four months. administration officials have since muddied the waters further, briefing reporters that there is no timeline for withdrawal whatsoever.
the document describes the effort as a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the al senate race by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing jones. jones has said he had no knowledge of project birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.
the announcement, in which trump declared that the islamic state had been defeated, prompted the resignation of retired marine gen. jim mattis as defense secretary and the resignation of the lead u.s. envoy to the coalition fighting the militant group.
maddie: i could see us being pretty good friends in the future; he's such a nice human, which is kind of rare to find at our age. i don't think we clicked romantically, but i'm not sure — my thoughts aren't very clear on this yet.
tuesday, january 26, 1999; page e1 intel corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. the turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott intel products in protest of the chip's id component. this is a significant victory for privacy, said barry steinhardt, associate director for the american civil liberties union, who praised intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. they did it on internet time. in announcing the id feature of the new pentium iii microprocessor last week, intel officials described it as an important step for internet security. the id number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. while each chip still will have a unique number, intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the id function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. chuck mulloy, a spokesman for the santa clara, calif., company, acknowledged that intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. we're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, mulloy said.
for the first time in decades, the house of representatives opened a new session with one vacant seat — the 9th district of north carolina. mark harris, the republican who declared victory in that race in november, spent thursday filing a motion in wake county superior court, asking to be certified as a member of congress.
adam: a 4.5 [out of 5]. it was an extremely pleasant evening. i left feeling very happy.
one of the underlying tenets of belonging to a community is the shared responsibility for the safety and well-being of its members.
these plans tend to be more affordable than the typical unlimited data plan, assuming you stay within your data limits. for example, the difference in price between a 2 gb plan on verizon and an unlimited plan on the same network is about $45 a month for a single line.
republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when rep. john a. boehner (r-ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as house speaker, despite dissent.
sept. 30: this is the end of the third fundraising quarter, and by this point in previous cycles, candidates who've struggled have seen their futures and dropped out. in 2011 and 2015, the first two republican primaries in the era of the super pac, several candidates plowed forward despite raising nearly nothing for their own campaigns. the toxicity of big money pacs in democratic politics is likely to alter that trend.
in oregon's case, the acting u.s. attorney, billy j. williams — who is awaiting senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.
compare that to how the executive branch has handled social media. the presidential records act, which went into effect in 1978, mandated that all official presidential records belong to the public. presidents have kept this law in mind even when using new technologies. for instance, when the white house joined snapchat in 2016, a senior obama white house official told buzzfeed that it would fully comply with those requirements, saving and preserving snaps for archives.
this system had serious shortcomings. when party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the house struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. for example, mccormack failed to pass most of the kennedy legislative program in the 87th congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large democratic majority.
dec. 11 added bloomberg and patrick.
after his spell at school in london, he returned to jamaica and soon became a successful sales manager for the dutch-owned curacao trading co. in 1968, he set up his own company, appliance traders ltd., to sell air-conditioning units, fridges and freezers, and it remains the parent company to sandal resorts international.
children's hospitals may be partially to blame to for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
on thursday, a group of republican lawmakers released a letter warning that the taliban has a history of extracting concessions in exchange for false assurances.
my initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign i've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. roy moore is so well known in alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started, said university of alabama political scientist joseph l. smith.
last year, then-defense secretary ashton carter unveiled a policy allowing service members to remain at a particular duty station for an extended period in exchange for extended service.
i am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, i will be vehemently denounced, romney said on the senate floor. i am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. does anyone seriously believe i would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before god demanded it of me?
still, trump takes particular pride in republicans sticking with him, regularly peppering aides with questions about any republican defections on legislation. during impeachment, he repeatedly told advisers that he wanted a bipartisan acquittal — hoping to get at least one democrat to vote with him, and for republicans to stick together.
mcdaniel issued the statement quickly to make clear whose side she was on and to get ahead of potential stories that were likely to question her loyalty to the president if she remained silent, a republican official said. she did not receive a heads-up from her uncle and the president did not ask her to put out a statement, according to the official.
the commission made recommendations it said schools should adopt immediately, including keeping school gates and doors locked when not in use, and making sure school personnel are present when gates and doors are being used. all doors should be locked, too, and teachers should be able to lock them from the inside, with access to the keys.
south africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. britain's health minister matt hancock told bbc radio 4's today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the uk new variant. the south africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. john bell, a professor of medicine at the university of oxford and a member of britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.
maddie: he's one of the most genuinely nice people i've ever met in my whole life. if you meet him, you immediately know he's not a very judgmental person.
although the situation facing dreamers is a crisis that was created by donald trump, martinez said democrats are not without power, especially now that sen. doug jones (d-ala.) has joined the caucus. they have a closer margin now, and we expect them to meet their public and private commitment to us that they'll use every leverage they have.
these former congressional interns share why the battle in congress over the deferred action for childhood arrivals program is so personal. (melissa macaya, patrick martin/the washington post)
caryn ernst, a parent activist, sits on a mayoral task force that aims to increase collaboration between charters and the school system. ernst said she was surprised to learn about bowser's proposal. the task force last fall considered and rejected a similar idea, according to ernst.
march 1 steyer dropped out of the presidential race.
if anything, driving while texting or talking on a mobile device has become ever more widespread since then. some experts believe that recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in traffic deaths can be blamed at least in part on the widespread habit of texting or talking while driving.
consider the rule changes to which pelosi reportedly agreed. the changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.
what changed: nyse on monday said it had further discussions with 'relevant regulatory authorities' about the treasury department's recent statement on its intention to publicly name the subsidiaries of the banned groups.
dickerson — who is best known for leading the effort to fix healthcare.gov, the glitchy portal for president barack obama's signature health-care initiative — said in a statement to the post that he learned of the extent of project birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.
i believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, democrats will regain the house and senate. but you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, sanders said in an interview. if it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'it doesn't make a difference. why should i be involved?'
congress will probably provide backpay for furloughed federal employees such as scheflen. but the likelihood of money in the future doesn't pay bills due today. backpay for low-wage contractors, like those who serve lunch in federal cafeterias, is less likely.
one of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. after all, it's not just, if i eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, if i eat at this restaurant, could i make my server sick? as a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. i have to admit, i kind of liked it.
if you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for t-mobile or sprint. both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 mbps and video to 480p resolution. this means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. there doesn't appear to be a way around sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.
in recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimens that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges, the post's carolyn y. johnson reports.
information such as your web browsing history, your geolocation logs and even the content of your emails offer service providers a rich source of potential advertising revenue. that data, along with your health and financial information, can also be sold to marketers and data brokers interested in building a profile of you as a consumer. the fcc's rules restricted internet providers' ability to use and share this information, in what privacy advocates hailed as a historic victory.
the spokesman for the taliban's qatar office, suhail shaheen, told the washington post that the taliban hoped for a permanent solution to violence levels. but the pledge for a week-long period of reduced violence has ended, he said.
likewise, when british diplomats guy burgess and donald maclean defected to the soviet union in 1951, and two national security agency cryptologists, william martin and bernon mitchell, fled to moscow in 1960, many attributed their defections to deviant sexualities.
i was not a user, so they would ask me if i'd turn them in. my typical response: do what you want to do, but if i catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, i'll make sure you never work here again.
progressives such as rep. adriano espaillat (d-n.y.), whose harlem-area district is home to more than 2,000 constituents protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca, said he will continue voting against gop spending plans that don't include protections. over the holiday recess, he said daca was the issue i heard about the most when i'm walking in my district.
the description and timing fits the experience of mac watson, the owner of a patio supply store who ran a republican write-in campaign and said he had communications with a facebook page beginning on that date.
deborah a.p. hersman, president and chief executive of the national safety council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. it's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.
political analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.
dmitry polyanskiy, russia's first deputy permanent representative to the united nations, also took the opportunity to allege u.s. hypocrisy.
potential 2020 candidate sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) called afghanistan an unwinnable war in 2008 and as a presidential candidate in 2016 said he opposed continuation of the afghan occupation.
you really have to change your mindset to put your employees' safety and the safety of others on the road first, she said.
it costs $39.99 a month for the phone line, plus $49.99 for the unlimited data. because you can't have the unlimited data without the voice service, we can treat the sum as the effective cost of the unlimited plan. this person receives a few discounts here and there that appear tailored to their particular situation, so let's simply use the $90 base figure and move on.
the browns signaled that they don't have much use for osweiler, either, with football operations chief sashi brown starting off his official statement on the deal with, we're really excited to acquire a second-round draft choice in this trade.
online purchasing is a potential lifeline for snap participants living in urban neighborhoods and rural communities where access to healthy food choices can be limited, agriculture secretary tom vilsack said in a news release last week.
that does not mean that the dream of the modern left will become law this year. but advocates know that. rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), the sponsor of the house legislation, said having public hearings and traditional scoring for the bill will elevate it as a 2020 issue.
it's ludicrous that americans are denied federal services and workers like scheflen and earle suffer because trump and democrats differ over $4 billion for the border wall in a $4 trillion budget. trump bogusly and repeatedly promised during his 2016 presidential campaign that mexico would pay for his unpopular wall proposal.
the combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. while we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.
this would not be the longest vacancy in recent congressional history; a full year passed between the december 2017 resignation of michigan's john conyers and the seating of a democrat who won the special november 2018 election to replace him. but it could mean that for most of the next year, republicans have just 199 votes in the house, making it incrementally easier for democrats to pass bills.
october: iowa democrats will hold their fall dinner, formerly known as the jefferson-jackson dinner. this was the event that turned obama into the iowa front-runner, after months of slogging through and underperforming at candidate forums.
the georgia elections, if they go the way of democrats, would expand the ranks of senators backing a public option.
goldman sachs economists are predicting democrats will approve $600 billion in new emergency relief if they sweep the georgia runoffs to claim control of the senate. via aei's jim pethokoukis:
the voters of the ninth congressional district are entitled to have their elected representative in place by the time congress convenes, harris's attorneys wrote in their brief for the court.
this isn't the day's news but pink. this is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said ramshaw, who is ceo of the nonprofit. we are not doing turn-of-the-screw reporting, but rather what that turn of the screw means for different parts of the women's electorate.
i think the american democratic institutions are strong, and hopefully everything will return to normal shortly, he said.
so it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. a national safety council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.
clearly, hungary is not a democracy. but understanding why requires a nuanced understanding of the line between democracy and autocracy.
high-profile health venture is disbanding: haven, created two years ago by amazon, jpmorgan chase and berkshire hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website monday that it will shutter, jay greene reports.
the counter-iran campaign continues, pompeo told right-wing outlet newsmax on thursday. we'll do all of those things. … we will simply do it at a time when the american forces have departed syria.
bowser has pushed to increase school choice in the district. but some education advocates questioned monday's proposal. they said it could drain students from traditional d.c. schools and make it harder for students from low-income families to get into top charter schools, which are often located outside of their neighborhoods.
ocasio-cortez, a new york democrat, has been one of the most prominent users of instagram stories. she's offered voters everything from videos of herself preparing instant pot macaroni and cheese to a behind-the-scenes look at her time on the hill. just yesterday she used it to respond to a cbs news 60 minutes piece about her.
wells fargo to expand investment bank.
killing a journalist or firing on crowds of protesters can easily rally international opinion and turn an autocrat into a pariah. but few notice or care if party supporters infiltrate the electoral commission or a pro-government entrepreneur uses government funds to take control over an opposition website. and using the legal system to force out independent voices enables the government to argue that it has not abused power. for example, after forcing a leading independent university out of hungary, the government argued that this was the result of a perfectly reasonable requirement under hungary's legislation.
bits: the big apple news at this year's ces technology show will be the company's woes in china — a stark departure from the role the company's gadgets typically play in driving news at the annual las vegas trade show, bloomberg news's selina wang and mark gurman report. it's going to be the elephant in the room at ces, daniel ives, an analyst at wedbush securities, told bloomberg news. this has been dark days for apple and for the tech industry. i think there's a lot of questions in regards to the smartphone industry going forward, especially with what apple said about with demand in china.
contactless ordering and payment should stay an option — at some places.
do you even need an unlimited plan?
unfortunately, however, significant problems remain. in addition to the permanent beta theta pi ban, a total of 13 other greek organizations at penn state have received multiyear suspensions for safety violations. while these consequences demonstrate that we mean business, the large number of suspended chapters also shows that many students have ignored the call for behavior change and fallen short of our values and expectations.
romo, who graciously turned the quarterbacking reins over to rookie dak prescott in november, would surely be upset with such a hardball strategy by his longtime team. in addition, romo is close with jones, who may feel that, as matter of courtesy and respect, he owes it to the 36-year-old to simply release him and let him choose his own team. another possibility is that dallas hangs on to romo, as a valuable and well-paid insurance policy, but again, jones risks tension in his locker room.
the minnesota-based company, whose new policy applies to about 150,000 employees worldwide, is not the first or the largest to institute such a strict ban. but advocates at the national safety council believe cargill is the largest privately held corporation to do so.
the revelation of redl's treason just before the outbreak of world war i inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. five decades after redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, central intelligence agency director allen dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.
this sunday, feb. 4, will mark the one-year anniversary of the death of student timothy piazza. the university continues to mourn his tragic passing. in the immediate aftermath, it became clear wholesale changes were needed to create a sustainable greek system. we resolved to turn the pain and anguish radiating through our community into decisive reform.
employees could be disciplined for infractions, with actions ranging from a talk with the boss to termination, but that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, nelson said. she said the company is relying mostly on an honor system and peers to monitor and enforce the new policy.
researchers say that the overprescription of antibiotics is fueling drug resistant strains of dangerous bacteria like enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile.
• vuong dinh hue, 63, a former minister of finance, deputy prime minister and head of the party's central economic commission, may be in the running for prime minister.
at the same time, defenders of the fcc's privacy rules argue that internet providers are uniquely positioned to see everything a customer does with his or her connection — unlike services such as facebook, whose understanding of user behavior is generally limited to the boundaries of its own platform.
oregon has long had a tolerant attitude toward marijuana. it decriminalized possession of less than 1 ounce in 1973. and the newly legalized recreational pot industry brought in $85 million in tax revenue last year, said state attorney general ellen rosenblum.
i'm proud of her for choosing storm lake, said sean bagniewski, the chair of the polk county democratic party. it's one of the few iowa cities that's growing, and it's because it's been very welcoming to immigrants. it's known as a melting pot in rural iowa; i'd love to see more democrats heading there.
dec. 31: every new year's eve before the iowa caucuses marks the end of the fourth fundraising quarter; by jan. 15, just a few weeks before voting, every candidate will have revealed his and her totals for the year. then, and only then, will we know who endured the marathon, who ran out of money, and who kept raising money after being completely written off. and we're just 363 days away.
likewise, pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. in 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as house speaker. she will have served as the top democrat in the house for 19 years. if a democrat is elected president in 2020, pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. and if the republican experience provides any guidance, democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.
three of warren's five scheduled stops this weekend will take her to the 4th congressional district, represented by republican steve king. pottawattamie county backed trump by 21 points, woodbury county by 20 points, buena vista county by 24 points. and all went by double digits for gov. kim reynolds (r) in last year's statewide elections. just 10 years ago, barack obama had lost them by only a few points.
i think it is right to get our troops out of syria — and, let me add, i think it's right to get our troops out of afghanistan, warren said.
yet, while there is certainly an argument to be made for democrats to meet trump's hostage demands, make no mistake, this is trump's shutdown, and increasingly that of congressional republicans.
the turmoil also gave an opening for countries with poor track records on human rights and democracy to lecture a superpower.
the same goes for south korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the united states. trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the obama administration.
latest on the federal pandemic response
with recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. not only has wall street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.
in rural iowa town, warren finds immigration key topic:
the name derives from the 19th amendment to the constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the american media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.
in venezuela — which has been embroiled in political and social crises for years — jorge arreaza, the foreign minister in authoritarian leader nicolás maduro's government, issued a statement condemning the political polarization and the spiral of violence that reflects the profound political and social crisis the united states is currently experiencing.
on monday, ramshaw and zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as craigslist founder craig newmark and kathryn murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.
both senators faced justice department scrutiny for stock trades they made early last year in the wake of briefings on the threat posed by the then-impending coronavirus pandemic. the justice department ended up dropping the probes.
ghani faces the challenge of building an inclusive negotiating team to represent the afghans who are not aligned with the taliban. the announcement of disputed election results earlier this month has left the government in kabul deeply divided and has the potential to undermine ghani's mandate to form that team.
because vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. this happened, for instance, at a giant foods store in northeast washington, d.c., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, the post's lola fadulu reports . the decision was in line with guidance from the d.c. department of health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.
perhaps the most controversial recommendation among dozens made by the commission called for training and giving weapons to teachers willing to carry arms. it is not clear how that will be received by administrators, teachers, students and parents. some of the student survivors of the shooting have become leaders in a national youth gun-control movement, and the broward county school board voted in april not to accept state money appropriated for that purpose.
school safety in florida needs to be improved. we can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on k-12 school campuses. not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at marjory stoneman douglas high school (msdhs) on february 14, 2018.
according to his friend, jamaica observer founding editor desmond allen, he once took glamorous british actress joan collins to a secluded reef where she proceeded to have a nude dip. he was still a boy, and she did not invite him to join her. (he could only have dreamed then that he would one day own his own 132-foot, $5 million yacht, the lady sandals, on which he sailed until shortly before his death.)
more than that, though, ww84 nails the mood of a certain sort of d.c. resident who believes that earning an internship in the white house would be enough to give a gangly young dork the gumption to ask a literal amazon goddess out on a date.
why do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? parties make a critical trade-off. they empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. but those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.
it is unknown how many of the district's 82 elementary charter schools support the measure. scott pearson, executive director of the d.c. public charter school board, called the measure an interesting enrollment proposal that addresses real issues families face.
the internet research agency engaged in many, many tactics, some of which i think it is appropriate for us to mirror and some of which i think we should disavow. the tactics they engaged in [that] we need to disavow [include] misinformation and promoting racial hatred, mehlhorn said. the tactics we need to mirror are really good social microtargeting.
overall, it's making sure employees know of the dangers of driving while distracted and how important that cargill feels that safety is first, nelson said.
this is very complicated stuff that could perpetuate divisions within our city and communities, and it will have to be very thought through, grosso said. i am not too inclined to support it, but i am open to having a conversation.
the rules, which passed by a 3-to-2 partisan vote favoring democrats at the federal communications commission in october, are meant to keep internet providers such as comcast, verizon and others from abusing the behavioral data they collect on customers as they regularly use the internet.
tsa screened more than 1.3 million people sunday, the most during the pandemic: during the first three days of january, the tsa screened more than 3.3 million people. approximately 1.2 million people moved through tsa checkpoints saturday before the record the next day, lori aratani during the first three days of january, the tsa screened more than 3.3 million people. approximately 1.2 million people moved through tsa checkpoints saturday before the record the next day, lori aratani reports
many eyes were already turned on the united states, as foreign observers tracked the closely contested runoff senate race in georgia. by wednesday afternoon, both democratic candidates, raphael warnock and jon ossoff, had been declared winners — tipping the senate to the democrats, thereby granting the party control of both the white house and congress.
but house rules committee chairman jim mcgovern (d-mass.) advanced two major exceptions, which the house approved yesterday. legislation to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic or public health consequences of the coronavirus pandemic or climate change will be exempted from the pay-as-you-go rules.
what if i have a grandfathered unlimited plan?
the legislation would fund agencies indirectly related to border security. the department of homeland security would receive temporary funding, providing a month for the discussions to continue.
nothing in this election changed americans' fundamental rights, or their need for privacy, said matt wood, policy director for free press, an advocacy organization. the election only gave more power to the party that would seemingly rather side with comcast and other cable lobbyists than with their own constituents.
july 8 swalwell dropped out of presidential race.
and the panel said school safety requires attention to the mental health of students and acknowledged:
party and campaign officials said privately that they hoped trump wouldn't obsess over the lone defection and move on from impeachment, basking in his acquittal instead of engaging in a days-long tiff with romney. the president has firm control of the party and could dictate a strategy that is more aggressive, advisers said, if his pique at romney flares.
some foreign outlets, including the bbc and the australian newspaper the sydney morning herald, maintained live coverage of wednesday's developments in washington.
in the view of the world, the trump era provided no shortage of captivating spectacle, sometimes grim. wednesday's events went beyond that, into disconcerting territory: far-right attacks on democracy made literal. chilling footage from the scene circulated globally, of lawmakers fleeing, capitol police with their guns drawn inside the capitol building and a mob of angry trump supporters running loose in the halls. one photo showed a man sitting in the chair of a member of house speaker nancy pelosi's (d-calif.) staff, his feet on the desk. another showed a man appearing to carry away the speaker's lectern.
party officials said they did not give instructions for anyone to call for romney's expulsion from the party, but one republican fundraiser said that donors who once supported romney are now solidly behind trump. as the republican party noted in its release attacking romney, the president is more popular than the senator in utah.
so what does this mean in practice? china runs by far the largest trade surplus with the united states, some $319 billion in 2016. that's nearly half of the u.s. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. in fact, china bought just $104 billion in u.s. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the united states.
the top brass in the pentagon, meanwhile, is hardly convinced that the islamic state has been defeated. military officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces (sdf), which it considers part of a kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the islamic state, my colleagues reported.
to help students and their families make more informed decisions about greek life at penn state, we instituted a scorecard that reviews the performance of each chapter.
wonder woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as diana prince (gal gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. but while it's a pretty bad dc comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes dc comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid washington, d.c. movie. given hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see ww84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the district and its residents can be.
this is the approach advocated by biden, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and moderate democrats. yet the republicans spent the last two months pummeling ossoff and warnock over health care, labeling them as extremist and socialist and painting them as medicare-for-all proponents.
cabot and others had already reported that the browns were interested in trading for garoppolo, and it's entirely possible that the patriots have been playing hardball with them behind the scenes. cleveland holds the no. 1 overall pick in the nfl draft, but understandably wants to keep it. the browns also have the no. 12 pick, which could be in play but possibly not enough to get a deal done.
leaders around the world condemned the pro-trump mob that stormed the u.s. capitol on jan. 6 and reaffirmed their faith in american democracy. (the washington post)
adam: she said, no, people at gw don't care. i was like, shoot, maybe american kids are way more petty. [laughs.]
hoffman's financial relationship with aet was brokered by his political adviser, dmitri mehlhorn, who heads a group called investing in us that helps direct silicon valley money into left-leaning political causes.
fed loan program for midsize firms had few takers: washington was happy to rely on the fed because it had the chops to get a program for medium-size businesses up and running fast. its apolitical reputation reduced concern about loans being steered to big donors. the treasury department became a fed partner to absorb any loan losses, the wall street journal's nick timiraos reports.
he added, all preferences have complex effects so we're speaking with school leaders and others to better understand their perspectives.
we are laser-focused on january 19 as a do-or-die moment, said greisa martinez, advocacy director for united we dream, an immigrant advocacy group organizing protests on capitol hill against republicans and democrats who have voted for previous gop spending bills.
maddie: we both studied economics. he told me about his job, and it was really cool and interesting. i don't get to talk to other econ people that often.
top ceos and business groups made explicit their objection to the election challenges.
i don't trust president trump's ability to keep us safe by himself, and i'm very concerned that he's making decisions that go against military advice, without consulting congress or our allies, kaine said in a statement to the washington post.
at the heart of the chaos is a clear split within the white house. trump, who espouses a kind of nationalist isolationism, is keen on disentangling the united states from costly military adventures that offer him minimal political returns at home.
project birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire reid hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of democratic causes after the 2016 election. while acknowledging his money ended up paying for project birmingham, hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the new york times and the post.
the result of trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by china; a less dynamic american economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change. it's not a world any of us should want to live in.
the afghan war has not been a major focus for new house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), and it is not clear whether she has much appetite for a major debate on the u.s. commitment there.

ramshaw is not accepting anonymous donations to the site and will maintain a list of funders on the site in an effort to be as transparent as possible about who is supporting the journalism at the 19th.
trump is scheduled to speak about the senate vote to acquit him of the two house impeachment charges at the white house on thursday — an event that will serve as an indication whether he's ready to move on from romney's vote or try to make him another of example of what happens to republicans who cross him.
oct. 24 ryan dropped out of presidential race.
maddie: i don't know. i don't really believe in the school rivalries.
prior to presenting the report in september, i edited new knowledge's report for length and to redact identifying information, dickerson wrote in his statement to the post. this was the only firsthand account of this kind of operation that i knew of, so i presented it to the group to analyze and discuss.
lawmakers from both parties discussed on jan. 6 how a deal could be reached to end the government shutdown. (luis velarde/the washington post)
as parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. but a leader who engendered dissent within the party like pelosi likely would not have survived.
the brookings institution hosts a discussion titled how china and the u.s. are advancing artificial intelligence on jan. 14.
as the fulcrum of the immigration talks has shifted decisively toward the senate, lawmakers on the hard right are pressuring house speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.) to be more assertive. they are wary that house members will get jammed with a senate bill that they will have no choice but to pass mainly with democratic votes.
the withdrawal will begin with a drawdown to 8,600 troops within 135 days, according to the document. during that time, u.s. allies and coalition members will also proportionally draw down their forces.
howard thinks it's time for new record-keeping rules, including ones account for social media and disappearing posts. though much of the data created by congressional committees and administrative officers is considered official records and archived, individual members can decide what to do with papers and content created by their own offices. it's considered their personal property, and they can determine what they want to preserve. there's lots of reasons that politicians choose not to have things be archived, howard says.
jan. 31 delaney dropped out of presidential race.
the document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving enough votes to ensure a doug jones victory.
google employees form workers' union in the u.s.: more than 200 employees and contractors at google parent alphabet inc in the united states and canada have formed a labor union to promote workplace equity and ethical business practices, the group's elected leaders said, reuters's paresh dave and ayanti bera report.
adam: my job is very niche — most people think it's the most boring thing of all time. i was glad she didn't think it was super lame.
adam: she was exactly my type. she's very pretty, she's friendly and gregarious — our personalities seemed to click right off the bat.

both appear willing to do whatever it takes to stay in trump's good graces. they are also reliable corporate allies, hailing from c-suites themselves. perdue was a senior executive at reebok during a business career he capped by serving as ceo of dollar general.
feb. 27-march 2: the annual conservative political action conference, or cpac, will be held again in suburban washington. trump has appeared there every year since entering the 2016 republican primary, and the local reception for him has evolved from contempt (2016) to jubilation (2017) to outright adoration (2018).

how important marijuana becomes as a topic of campaign debate is likely to hinge on how sessions's directive, issued last week, is implemented by u.s. attorneys across the country, many of whom are serving on an interim basis until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed by the senate.
the iphone xr in particular struggles to convince chinese consumers, as the wall street journal's yoko kubota noted. the xr hasn't sold as expected in china because it is being passed over by both price-conscious buyers and status seekers, analysts say, kubota wrote. some chinese consumers have perceived the sticker price of 6,499 yuan, or about $945, to be too expensive even though it is at least 25% cheaper than the higher-end iphone xs and xs max models.
goodlatte's plan would grant legal status to daca recipients, provide funding for a border wall, end a visa lottery program criticized by trump, take action against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and roll back rules allowing legal immigrants to sponsor the entry of certain family members. but house republican leaders do not think the bill will be able to garner enough support to pass by the deadline.
andrew cuomo threatens to fine hospitals that don't distribute remaining vaccines: under what the new york governor described as a 'use it or lose it' policy at a monday briefing, hospitals can be fined up to $100,000 for failing to distribute existing supplies by the week's end, or failing to administer doses within seven days once they receive new shipments. he also suggested that future deliveries could be rerouted to hospitals that have been more successful at getting people immunized, antonia noori farzan under what the new york governor described as a 'use it or lose it' policy at a monday briefing, hospitals can be fined up to $100,000 for failing to distribute existing supplies by the week's end, or failing to administer doses within seven days once they receive new shipments. he also suggested that future deliveries could be rerouted to hospitals that have been more successful at getting people immunized, antonia noori farzan reports
something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. in the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. a modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. an advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.
the challenge now is to secure these gains, he said.
— netflix is the latest example of software companies that seek to sell their services directly to consumers and circumvent apple or google, my colleague brian fung reported. netflix confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through itunes. instead, subscribers are being redirected to make payments on netflix's own website, my colleague reported.
3. who's in contention for the top job?
mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.
but despite the chaos, there were some innovations that made the lives of staff and customers easier, or even better. the district changed alcohol laws to allow bars to sell cocktails and six-packs for carryout and delivery, providing a source of income when indoor spaces were closed to the public. the idea proved so popular that the regulations became permanent in october. no one can predict exactly when we'll get back to normal, but whenever that happens, i hope these other changes stick around.
still, republicans ended their first day of divided government by promising to hold pro-pelosi democrats accountable. america rising blasted out a list of 21 democrats who went back on their word to back pelosi that included 11 from increasingly blue districts carried by clinton. the house gop's own rapid-response team called out 11 democrats, nine of whom won in safe blue seats.

in 2012, the colts released peyton manning, knowing that they were set to draft andrew luck with the no. 1 overall pick. another factor in that decision was that indianapolis had salary-cap issues while manning was set to make a huge amount of money (he was due a $28 million roster bonus), which also made him nearly impossible to trade.
ceo charlie scharf continues to leave his imprint: the push would take the fourth-largest u.s. bank a step closer to emulating some of its biggest rivals, including jpmorgan chase & co., where scharf spent over a decade before running visa inc. and bank of new york mellon corp, bloomberg news's hannah levitt reports.
many gay and lesbian workers quietly resigned rather than face humiliating security interrogations, others committed suicide without leaving an explanation, and untold numbers never even applied for jobs due to the prohibition on their employment. it was not until 1995, when president bill clinton signed an executive order reversing the eisenhower measure, that sexual orientation was removed from the list of conditions justifying the denial of a security clearance.
of course, this framework is only one way of looking at trump's foreign policy priorities, and it doesn't explain his hawkish stance over iran or concern over north korea's nuclear program.
i acknowledge working with aet, but i don't recognize the claims they're making now, morgan said on medium. we did not write the leaked report and we could not have because it didn't reflect our research. the leaked version of the report made a number of claims that did not originate with us.

the national safety council, again citing 2010 figures, says 20 percent of the fortune 500 companies imposed total bans. some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as pokemon go, are not on them, hersman said. and a survey cited by the council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.

a peace deal with the taliban has been a critical foreign policy goal for trump, who campaigned on ending the war. but he has faced fierce criticism from the afghan government as well as from fellow republicans at home.
unlimited plans benefit heavy data users
but the implication of the trade-first philosophy is that neither taiwan nor the south china sea really matters to trump, except as ways to beat up on a country he sees as a direct economic threat.
tom steyer. the next three stops on his five rights tour are iowa, new hampshire and nevada; he announced as much last month but clarified this week that the iowa stop will be in des moines.
coal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the united states. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.
beyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that trump endorsed the soviet invasion of afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the united states and the free world. (you'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist communist dictatorship.) former ambassador to russia michael mcfaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:
udall said a government shutdown would be a disaster for new mexico and the 45,000 residents who work for the federal agencies and research labs in his state.
first, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. former ukrainian president leonid kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. governing parties may also create a biased news media. in malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.
nicola sturgeon, the first minister of scotland, described the situation as utterly horrifying and called for solidarity with those … on the side of democracy and the peaceful and constitutional transfer of power. irish prime minister micheál martin tweeted that the people of ireland have a deep connection with the united states and that many, like me, will be watching the scenes unfolding in washington dc with great concern and dismay.

the genesis for this belief lay in the career of col. alfred redl. a gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the austro-hungarian army, redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to russia in 1913. redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late belle époque vienna. however, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the russians over it.
in any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. but an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. let's look at how that works.

intel drops plans for id numbers by robert o'harrow jr. and elizabeth corcoran
trump's intransigence demonstrates the hollowness of the republican position. he rejects, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) refuses to consider, appropriation measures the senate approved last month that would end the shutdown. the house voted for the legislation after democrats took control last week, but mcconnell won't call for a necessary vote in the senate.

the national safety council says motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of work-related fatalities and account for about 24 percent of all work-related injuries. the nonprofit organization, using 2010 data, estimates that at least 24 percent of all fatal crashes involved drivers using cell phones and that at least 160,000 crashed involved drivers who were texting.
progressive groups are planning to apply fresh pressure on democrats who voted to temporarily extend government funding in december without addressing daca — a mix of moderates facing reelection this year in states trump won in 2016 and others from states with sizable populations of federal government workers.
the operation, called project birmingham, used tactics such as a false flag effort to create bogus evidence that russian bots supported jones's republican opponent roy moore on twitter, according to a 12-page document obtained by the post. another component of project birmingham was the creation of a deceitful facebook page targeting conservative voters in alabama and aiming to hamper moore's campaign.

amid a slate of partisan and bipartisan proposals, another conservative immigration plan may emerge in the coming days. according to a lawmaker and a gop aide familiar with the plans, house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte (r-va.) is expected to unveil a bill as soon as this week that would address daca in exchange for a raft of conservative priorities on immigration.
this intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (to be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) this is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the trump administration.
i am glad trump brought up the end of the soviet union, however. the u.s.s.r. didn't magically change its name; the west won the cold war (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). putin views the fall of the soviet union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing russia as a great power, which trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing syria to russia and its ally iran.
among others proposing that scenario was mary kay cabot, a longtime browns beat writer. the browns have the ammunition to acquire jimmy garoppolo and will try to put together a strong package that the patriots will accept, she wrote at cleveland.com.
larry kudlow, trump's top economic adviser, said he thinks a meeting between trump and powell will happen and that it will help both sides to talk through their differences. but kudlow and powell said no meeting has been scheduled yet.
normally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. this requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.
beijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from asia to the united states. but china's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.
over the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. a survey conducted in october by the pew research center found that 61 percent of u.s. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. among republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among gop-leaning voters younger than 40.

if robb is right, that's very bad news for china, but it doesn't make welcome reading for countries such as mexico, germany and japan. unless they can take steps to reduce their trade imbalances with the united states, they are unlikely to be fully trusted by a man who sees trade as a zero-sum game, and sees anyone beating the united states as a threat.

may 31-june 2: the california democratic party convention is happening in san francisco this year, and, for the first time since 2008, the state has secured an early slot on the primary calendar. that's likely to turn this into a showcase for multiple democrats, in a forum where a good speech, in front of a massive audience, can get national attention. it was here in 2003 that howard dean pronounced himself a member of the democratic wing of the democratic party and assailed democrats who'd backed the iraq war.

the united states will not hesitate to nullify the agreement, esper said at a ceremony with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg and afghan president ashraf ghani that was held at the same time as the signing in doha.
unfortunately for harris, that's not how this works. democrats, whose majority gives them the power to seat or refuse to seat new members, have been adamant: there will be no member from this district until there is a judgment on allegations that harris paid a republican operative to discard ballots that could have swung the election.
as cabot noted on twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for tony romo to possibly join the texans. having lured osweiler away from the broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup tom savage, and the texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land romo.
romney's colleagues are highly unlikely to kick him out of the senate republican conference, but the president's allies could push for such a move and make life uncomfortable for romney and his colleagues. while several senators criticized romney's vote, many were quick to oppose giving him the boot.
during the campaign, journalists wrote stories about twitter accounts that appeared to be russian followers of moore.
trump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. he has also warned toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in mexico, and he argued that japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing u.s. troops in okinawa.

poor families might also choose to shop online for the same reason middle-class families do: they'll get extra time to spend at work or with their families, instead of shopping at a brick-and-mortar store. on the most basic level, time spent with children is a luxury low-income parents often cannot afford, clio chang wrote in a report for the century foundation. emotional neglect can adversely affect childhood development.

but sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who voted against the temporary spending plan in december, characterized the looming shutdown as an opportunity for democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
as the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the project birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. those included a false flag effort that generated phony evidence that automated russian accounts called bots had supported moore on twitter and the creation of a misleading facebook page, aimed at alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival republican through a write-in campaign.
lee may get new support from liberal antiwar democrats who took their seats on thursday, including rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york. during her campaign, ocasio-cortez said she probably would not have voted in favor of any of the troop commitments approved since the start of the afghan war, although she voiced some support for obama's rationale that his troop increase was an attempt to deal with this mess of going into afghanistan in the first place.
under the lottery system, there are charter school enrollment preferences for children of founding board members and siblings of current students. grosso said adding another preference would possibly deny students an equal opportunity to enroll in quality schools.

it soon became a lifeline, with some brewery owners delivering cases by hand, and rockville's true respite setting up the popular biermi online order and delivery service, which they shared with breweries across the region. as shelves in supermarkets and liquor stores have become more crowded, delivery has become a new niche where breweries can stand out — look at 3 stars and its monthly csb delivery program, which puts unreleased, ultra-fresh beers in the hands of members before the general public. but more importantly, this is a way for breweries to use a perceived convenience as a way to introduce themselves to new audiences.
republicans control congress but democrats hold significant leverage over spending talks. in the house, hard-liners on the right have regularly voted against recent spending bills, requiring gop leaders to rely on at least some democratic votes to pass. in the senate, spending bills require at least 60 votes to avoid procedural hurdles, and republicans only hold 51 seats.

miller: well, i think that it's been an important reminder to all americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. one unelected judge in seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. i mean this is just crazy, john, the idea that you have a judge in seattle say that a foreign national living in libya has an effective right to enter the united states is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before.

many of these plans come with a trade-off of some kind or another, meaning that although they vastly expand the amount of data you're allowed to use compared with other plans, they're still not technically unlimited as their marketing may imply.
aides note romney was at the white house twice in november, including for a lengthy meeting on vaping in the roosevelt room.
that said, there are bars where i want to engage the staff about new beers and cocktails on the menu, or solicit opinions about the best wine to complement an entree. contactless ordering has the effect of turning professional servers into glorified food runners. but for large, busy spaces, such as beer gardens or slammed happy hour spots, tech might offer a better way forward.
the economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. the former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. the latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.
other major challenges lie ahead: afghanistan's deepening political crisis, a controversial prisoner swap and complex intra-afghan talks that could drag on for months or longer.
last september, dickerson presented what he said was a truncated version of the project birmingham debrief at a meeting of technology experts — several of them alumni of the obama administration — in downtown washington. the 13 attendees of that meeting were required to sign nondisclosure agreements.
if there's an nfl team known for a strategy of stocking up on draft picks, it's the patriots, who have often traded back from their first-round positions, sometimes to the dismay of their fans (although they obviously can't complain much about the results). could this year's no. 12 pick, plus a second-rounder, get them to give up garoppolo? how about three second-round picks? we may find out, but the team can hardly expect to see a stronger offers than those for an essentially still-unproven player.

politically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. it was filed days after the departure of one democratic commissioner, jessica rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior democrat, tom wheeler, is due to step down. both moves will leave the fcc with a two-republican majority and a one-democrat minority, allowing the gop to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as president-elect donald trump is sworn into the oval office.

we have a growing, robust industry. you can't put that genie back in the bottle, rosenblum said. we're not freaking out. one of the keys is a good relationship with your u.s. attorney.
another potential obstacle is a planned prisoner exchange. the text of the peace deal released by the state department said the prisoner swap — the release of thousands of taliban prisoners in afghan custody for about 1,000 members of the afghan security forces in taliban captivity — must occur by march 10 when inter-afghan talks are set to start.

you need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and i look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting band-aids on them after they develop, murdoch said.
governing parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. the most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win. a country is not a democracy when gerrymandering makes it all but impossible for the opposition to win national power.

inside wells fargo, managers say they intend to build a more commensurate presence on wall street, where the firm ranks a mere ninth in capital markets and deal advisory, by focusing on business lines and industries where it already has credibility. that would translate, for example, to providing more underwriting and merger advice to corporate clients, but also lending to hedge funds looking to ramp up bets.

trump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. his policy is not america first — as in america leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. rather it is, russia first as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. if ronald reagan's response when asked how the cold war would end was, we win, they lose, trump's is: putin wins. let's bury our heads in the sand.
right now politicians largely use this new form of social media to highlight light moments and seem more down-to-earth to voters, but some are worried about the impact this technology could have when it is used for more important policy announcements.

near the start of this episode, peter does just that for hannah ann, though he organizes his thoughts on paper, an entreaty of affection on what appears to be a lined yellow legal pad, which is, as everyone knows, the most romantic kind of stationery. high on the list: he loves that she has a name for every dress [she's] ever worn. does he, though?
i'm worried i'm abandoning him and he will end up with weird issues.

in the past, there's been a public report and a separate classified version. but this year there is only one version – and it's entirely unclassified. this is part of an effort by coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the deep state.
when i asked mcconnell how he felt about his legacy and trump's being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. 'i don't think so,' he said.

'i think that's the most consequential thing i've ever done.'

priefer's stint with the vikings is also noteworthy for a two-game suspension in 2014, after an outside investigation determined that there was credibility to a former player's accusation that he once said, we should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.

4. the ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before—politically, militarily, economically, and ideologically—is undermining traditional institutions. this empowerment of groups and individuals is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict, and challenging the ability of traditional governments to satisfy the increasing demands of their populations, increasing the potential for greater instability. some violent extremist groups will continue to take advantage of these sources and drivers of instability to hold territory, further insurgencies, plan external attacks, and inspire followers to launch attacks wherever they are around the world.

it is a solid bet lemahieu could have made more on a per-year basis elsewhere — with the toronto blue jays believed to have been the most aggressive suitor — had he opted for that over the larger guarantee. but it is also possible he encountered a free agent market that had been depressed somewhat by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
they made a point of introducing themselves, shaking hands or hugging, and smiling sympathetically as they did. they stood somberly as antonia was lowered into the ground. they held my father's hand as they walked to his car. we wanted those people to know we weren't the monsters she must've told them we were, my mom told me later. even if they couldn't change any minds, they declined to use the event to exorcise their frustrations.

-- the high court announced it will consider a new york city gun law, marking the first time the justices have taken up a second amendment case in nearly a decade. robert barnes reports: the decision to hear the case in the term that begins in october may signal that the reinforced conservative majority on the court is ready to examine more laws that restrict gun rights. new york's law is not replicated elsewhere: it permits transporting handguns only to firing ranges within the city. those who challenged the law have licenses to keep a handgun at their homes. petitioners included those who want to take their guns to firing ranges or competitions outside the city, and one who wanted to take the gun to his second home upstate.

8. many adversaries continue to pursue capabilities to inflict catastrophic damage to u.s. interests through the acquisition and use of [weapons of mass destruction]. their possession of these capabilities can have major impacts on u.s. national security, overseas interests, allies, and the global order. the intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of wmd and advanced conventional weapons are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, wmd-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of wmd stockpiles.
but it is her job to figure out how to feel better about her own life. you do you.
this part of the film is the most interesting — and, depending on your predisposition, potentially poignant — segment. but created equal is, by design, a lopsided affair, with pack — a conservative filmmaker and former president of the right-leaning think tank the claremont institute — clearly sympathetic to thomas's self-characterizations. pack makes no attempt, for example, to present arguments that might counterbalance the claim of a lynching, however metaphorical. the comparison is drawn, somewhat absurdly, between thomas's treatment and the treatment of tom robinson, the character falsely accused — and convicted — of rape in to kill a mockingbird.
everyone seems to be looking for the same thing: a relationship. what a concept. in real life, not only do daters experience bad matches (someone who doesn't like you, you don't like them, or you clearly both don't like each other), but they also endure the heartbreak of good matches with bad timing (such as one person being off to a job or grad school in a different city). not to mention online daters having to shoehorn these meetups and their relationships into their busy, stressful lives. in hang the dj's community of singles, everyone seems to be on the same timeline, or at least they're willfully submitting to the system's.
she did eventually speak up, though, so you have that. use it by responding honestly with your concerns. say you wish she had said something as soon as this bothered her, and ask if there's a reason she didn't.
while the 29-year-old former heisman winner is single, he is looking for a woman to share his life, one who checks off a few boxes. of course i want a woman who i'm attracted to, he said. that's a very big part of it. but i'm looking for someone who loves jesus and loves people. someone who makes me want to be a better person for her.
this follows the state party's jan. 1 tweet announcing that we're never going back to the party of [mitt] romney, flake and mccain. thus, in one clause, did the arizona gop disavow both the last two republican presidential nominees before trump and the state's last two elected republican senators.

in his speech, northam pitched tax and budget plans that hinge on using $1.2 billion in new revenue that the state expects to collect as a result of last year's federal tax overhaul. he also urged the gop-controlled legislature to consider his plans to address gun violence — legislation that republicans snuffed out last year.
even if the constant pairings in hang the dj seem like drudgery, the episode is far more optimistic than the lobster. even as frank and amy drudge through unsatisfying matches, success seems more inevitable than a lifetime of loneliness.
so far, the solution has been to go around the problem: make the subject plural, when possible, to use they'' correctly, or use he or she'' with single nouns. but this is getting tedious and doesn't cover everybody. what we need is something simple that can be easily learned, so that no one is confused or insulted.

and ask how she would have preferred to handle the money. maybe she was fine with splitting but wished it had been less rigid — say, she buys dinner tonight, and you pick up the tab tomorrow, and so on. there's trust-centered splitting and nitpicky splitting and a vast range in between.

the st. louis post dispatch and the kansas city star reported that they too had possession of a transcript of the surreptitious recording and had interviewed the ex-husband. both papers said they had decided against writing a story because the woman declined to be interviewed. once the governor released a public statement the papers pushed ahead with their stories.

1. traditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence, taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment — including the weakening of the post-wwii international order and dominance of western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the west, and shifts in the global economy.
trump has routinely clashed with the intelligence community, likening the agencies to nazi germany shortly before he took office, repeatedly questioning their expert consensus that russia interfered in the 2016 election and boasting about his inauguration crowd size during a speech in front of the wall of stars that honors the fallen at cia headquarters.
2. russian efforts to increase its influence and authority are likely to continue and may conflict with u.s. goals and priorities in multiple regions.

we're in therapy, but it's been very hard for her to come to grips with her emotions. i can't help feeling like she married a concept instead of me. i also think part of the difficulty is her coming to terms with not being able to have a child as quickly and easily as she wanted.
-- irony alert: the shutdown has forced the state department to postpone an international conference on border security. cnn's michelle kosinski and jennifer hansler report: the 16th international export control and border security conference was scheduled to take place in edinburgh, scotland, in mid-february, with a goal of preventing the proliferation and transfer of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons across borders. however, it has been postponed 'due to uncertainty associated with the continuing partial u.s. federal government shutdown,' according to a letter ... signed by kathryn insley, the director of the office of export control cooperation.

not unreasonably, bell maintains that stone's accomplishments more than outweigh his transgressions. and who would argue otherwise when his wife forgave him everything? while i wish there had been more about stone's early life, the daughter he fathered outside his marriage and the sexual partners who clearly influenced his fiction, bell does a laudable job of explicating stone's novels, including the dark ones like outerbridge reach, and the breezy autobiography prime green, which describes stone's friendship with ken kesey. in the end, child of light leaves the reader with the urge to return to all of robert stone's work — surely the best sign of a fine biography.
your officer-friend is telling you exactly where he stands. he is saying, this is what works for me. if it doesn't work for you, you should find someone else. if he was more into you, he would probably beat a path to your door, no matter the distance. but — he is not.

nicole kidman. the name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to tom cruise and ensuing escape from scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. but one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.

i'm concerned that she and i have fundamentally different attitudes toward money, and also that we have fundamentally different attitudes toward communication, as i think she should have spoken up when i first proposed splitting 50-50, not waited until after the vacation was over.
the supreme court's decision to decline the trump administration's request for an expedited review of daca weakened the president's hand: if the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court's new term starts in october. that would probably keep the program in place until at least next year. with the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, trump's offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.
not many people saw kidman's mesmerizing portrayal of the photographer diane arbus in the boundary-breaking film fur, or her turn as a grieving mother in rabbit hole, or as the traumatized grown-up daughter of self-involved artists in the family fang. but she has become one of the industry's most valuable and adventurous side players, a headliner who — q scores and likability be damned — leverages her gifts and box-office pull in service to pushing the art form forward. it should surprise no one that her upcoming projects include the edgy, feminist tv mystery series top of the lake and films with sofia coppola and the greek provocateur yorgos lanthimos (the lobster).

one throughline is thomas's political evolution, beginning with an abortive stint as a catholic seminarian — the lone black student — that ended when he withdrew after hearing a racist remark. that was followed by his self-described leftward radicalization, subsequently abandoned, along with his anger, when he became what he calls a lazy libertarian at yale law school, then a left-leaning registered democrat and, years later, a reliable member of the conservative wing of the supreme court. as common as such transitions may be in the life of any 71-year-old, created equal doesn't offer many insights, at least not in a deeply satisfying way, as to how and why he has changed.

'time and again the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are strongest when they stand together,' said rep. michael mccaul (tex.), the ranking republican on the house foreign affairs committee. he called the alliance 'a bulwark against international terror' and 'critical to our national security, and to the preservation of our military prowess around the world.'

the trump white house in a nutshell: trump was impressed by [deputy press secretary hogan] gidley's television appearances during the previous government shutdown. once, after watching gidley on his screen in the residence, the president walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. in the days afterward, trump confused several officials when he directed them to, 'get me tidley.' 'who?' puzzled staffers asked. 'tidley,' trump replied. 'i want to talk to hogan tidley.' they informed him that the deputy press secretary's last name was gidley, not tidley.

-- the narrative: democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. david weigel and jenna johnson report: for years, democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. that caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … the party's swift shift has left vulnerable several democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current democratic thinking. those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.

we have been generous with our time, but my husband and i both have demanding jobs. we don't want to spend every christmas holiday sitting on my mother's couch.
alan: i've dated ladies in their 50s who are angry at their ex-spouse and angry at the dating scene. this was not like that at all. it was a nice, friendly date.
first vacationer: i'm definitely with you on the communication problem. yes, it would have helped for her to say something beforehand — if in fact she had doubts then. but even if she wasn't sure till she actually saw what you meant by 50-50, then speaking up on the spot would have been the more productive thing to do: hey, when you said 50-50, i thought you meant we'd share expenses — but i wasn't expecting that we'd split every meal down to the loose change.
kremlin warns russians against pro-navalny protests, detains opposition activists , by robyn dixon:  by robyn dixon:  the disconnect between the kremlin and russian social media influencers underscored putin's problems in reaching beyond his aging, conservative base to connect with the young, urban russians who want to be part of the modern world.
throw in the required regulatory licenses, and the possibility of creating a financial powerhouse is right there. but so too is the potential to mess it up.

-- ocasio-cortez builds a national platform, but a district office? not open yet, by the new york times's j. david goodman: in three short weeks in office, [ocasio-cortez] has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand. but she has not yet opened an office in her own new york city district — a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure. during an appearance on 'the late show with stephen colbert' on monday, she blamed the government shutdown. … but the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term congress members from new york state.
qanon believers seek to adapt their extremist ideology for a new era: 'things have just started,' by drew harwell:  by drew harwell:  biden's rise to the white house marked the biggest inflection point yet for qanon's core believers, who this week voiced doubts and frustrations that the movement's years-old promises of mass executions and an extended trump presidency had been bogus all along.
after they return home, they will start classes at a boarding school. i had no hope of going back to school, ya kaka said. now, she is enrolled at ramat polytechnic in maiduguri. she hopes to study international relations, and to someday represent her home state of borno. these opportunities, they know, are rare.
rimland, 29, is a lawyer who clerks for a federal judge in south florida. lohman, a lawyer as well, took a six-month job with a firm in los angeles to learn about representing clients in human trafficking cases.
jimmy fallon shared trump's window thoughts:
my mom thought she had the answer to that sort of bigotry. when my grandmother died in 2017, a dozen of her friends and family members came to her funeral: her two sons, women who knew her from the hair salon and other forays into town, her caretakers and neighbors — all white. my two brothers were there too, and my mom's brother and his new bride, all black. i chose not to attend.
invoking the virginia way of political compromise, northam catalogued the accomplishments of his first year in office — including expanding medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income virginians, raising the larceny threshold and securing funding for metro — and he urged both parties to cooperate.
dear amy: if the man who signed his letter love story truly wants to leave his wife for his lost love, but wants to leave gracefully, why doesn't he let his wife and children stay in their home?
worried: if you try hard enough, you can always find a good reason for not revealing the truth — to protect your mother's relationships, for instance.
alan: it didn't bother me. i wanted her to feel comfortable and relaxed, and i didn't mind talking about it. that was a large part of her conversation — her husband, who she said was her best friend. i complimented her and her marriage, and that she was in such a satisfying marriage.
we both have high school-age children.
frustrated and confused: uuuugh. i'm so sorry.
it's all i wanted, is that validation, peter says to the camera. in this regard, too, he is exactly like the hero of a romantic comedy.
we got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the liz cheneys of the world, trump said in the speech, singling her out as he urged the mob to march to the capitol.
what did they promise you? a weekend of lavish festivities?
dr. glazer studied sociology at the city college of new york, where, according to arguing the world, he argued, ate lunch and played table tennis in a cafeteria alcove with bell, kristol and literary critic irving howe. one of the characteristics of [our] group was a notion of its universal competence, he said, adding that he and his friends shot our mouths off on everything from culture to politics. their approach, he added, stemmed from the arrogance that if you're a marxist, you can understand anything, and it was a model that even as we gave up our marxism we nevertheless stuck with.
do you think this is a major problem? we have talked about marriage, and now i'm starting to think we're not as compatible as i thought we were.
but consider the significant concessions each side had to make to keep the marriage together. lemahieu, coming off an mvp-caliber season in which he hit .364 with a 1.011 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, receives an average annual salary that probably won't rank among the top 60 in the game in 2021. it is lower, in fact, than the mlb-wide qualifying offer of $18.9 million that teams could offer their free agents this offseason to stay for another year — and that all but two players rejected.
stay calm. it's time to talk.
whereas the prevailing wisdom was that social policies would make steady progress, i came to believe that although social policy had ameliorated some of the problems we had inherited, it had also given rise to other problems no less grave in their effect on human happiness, he wrote in the limits of social policy (1988).
i don't much mind that he is communicating with her, so much as the efforts he took to keep it secret.
two complaints were filed against ensz after he conducted the wedding, including from the rev. amanda miller garber, pastor of rise church in harrisonburg, va., who herself had conducted a same-sex ceremony in 2014 (she was suspended without pay for a month). disciplinary actions are worked out at the local level, and miller said that she thought if she filed a friendly complaint, ensz might be dealt with less harshly.
we have a loving marriage and an awesome family; anything beyond that is between us and god. i want the media and those who wish to peddle gossip to stay away from me and my children.
survivor: support and fellowship from other parents who have experienced terrible loss is a lifeline for survivors.
but first, please know this, because it's important: it doesn't mean you're not the most exciting person to hang out with. your wife's unhappiness is not rooted in your failure to provide what she needed. it's rooted in her decision to marry someone who didn't provide what she needed — to think she could set those misalignments aside for the purpose of getting the family she wanted. (not uncommon — even with wonderful people.)
esther recalled an old co-worker she used to think was crazy for washing her hands obsessively. the woman had lived through a tuberculosis outbreak decades earlier. the woman had explained to esther that they had to wash everything they touched. and now, esther thought, a thousand americans die of the coronavirus in one day. some days more.
you could try to hedge by saying, mom, i really don't like 'steve.' i haven't liked him since we were kids. i don't want to go to his wedding.
she moved recently and i don't have her address. if i ask her parents for her address it will raise a red flag, but i do want her to hear at least one positive voice over her engagement. if i contact her, i also risk her telling her parents, who will be mad at me. looking for a safe road through the minefield.
he isn't worried about running out of food, but i've noticed that, almost subconsciously, i've been rationing a little, he said.
-- ocasio-cortez a popular choice for president — even though she's too young to serve, by john wagner: a new poll finds that 74 percent of democrats and democratic-leaning adults would consider voting for [ocasio-cortez] for president if they could. for now, they can't. ocasio-cortez, who last year became the youngest woman elected to congress, is 29. under the constitution, you must be at least 35 to be president. the axios-surveymonkey poll highlights the splash that ocasio-cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has made since her arrival this month on capitol hill. the 74 percent of democrats and democratic-leaning adults who say they would vote for her for president includes 17 percent who say they would 'definitely' do so.
by objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the president and bestowing it instead on congress. this is directly at odds with the constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as republicans.
they're your feelings to feel, of course, but i see room — as in, pristine acres of rolling landscape — for you to reframe your view of your life, if you really wanted to do that.
whereas, the aft's endorsement decision in the presidential primary has been guided by three essential criteria: a candidate who shares our values, a candidate who has the support of our members, and a candidate who can defeat president trump. and in the more than 300,000 conversations we have had, our members believed when the time came, we would unify as a national union behind one candidate; and
but after that taste of the old life — and after his sister sent him home with cheerios, oreos and hummus — the isolation of the following days was all the more stark.
the vikings also noted then that the ban could be reduced to two games if priefer attended sensitivity training, and when he was reinstated after the first two weeks of the 2014 season, the team said it was informed that he had been fully and thoughtfully engaged throughout the process and successfully completed the [training] program.

-- this sunday's new york times magazine has a lengthy cover story on mitch mcconnell's legacy. the president whom the senate republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can't control, charles homans writes. when i asked elaine chao, who is trump's secretary of transportation and mcconnell's wife of 26 years, if trump and mcconnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, 'you'll have to ask the president that, and you'll have to ask the leader that.' when i did ask mcconnell, all he said was, 'yeah, we get along fine.' …
thursday is health care day. biden will rescind policies blocking federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services.
cheney blasted trump's proposal to withdraw u.s. troops from germany as dangerously misguided, prompting a rebuke from trump, who tweeted that liz cheney is only upset because i have been actively getting our great and beautiful country out of the ridiculous and costly endless wars. the dispute prompted some house republicans to launch a failed effort to oust her from her leadership post.
you have lots of options, but you know you'll end up with the best. when the dangers of online dating are discussed in real life, the paradox of choice comes up. this is the idea that, faced with an abundance of choices, be it on tinder or brands of cereal, we've become not freer and happier but more paralyzed and dissatisfied. the system aims to offer the best of both worlds: lots of options, and at the end of it you get the best one.
in san antonio, noel ​reschman had the radio on, and alan jackson's remember when reminded esther of better days. remember when i was young, and so were you, the song begins. remember when we vowed the vows.
on needing help with a partner who needs help:
mergers rarely go smoothly, and unicorn marriages are even more unusual. while now may be the perfect time to hook up, since the growth of their core businesses was already set to slow even before covid-19 hit the broader economy, the mechanics and internal friction from a deal could threaten their momentum. any shakeup of management, job losses, integration of systems, or clashes over direction could distract from the larger challenges of transitioning into a giant company that's really ready for public scrutiny.
maybe talking about it will confirm your new suspicions of a significant difference in attitude, which is a good, if painful, thing to do early. however, a frank discussion might also reveal that she has some ideas good enough to change your mind. people bring all kinds of differences to a relationship, and while it's important to keep your essential self intact, it's also a chance to learn other ways to do things and even incorporate a few upgrades into your world view and routine.
more importantly, pew also dug into the political views of that group, born in 1996 or later by pew's definition. the group mostly mirrors the generally liberal social politics of the millennials. in data provided to the washington post, though, we see this holds true even among the white men in the generation.
alan: once she mentioned how close and how satisfying her marriage was, i wanted her to know that there wasn't any current angst between me and my ex. that sort of cleared the air, that there was no lingering anger over any past relationships.
-- a group of progressive democrats, including rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), secured seats on the house oversight committee, giving them a platform to grill trump administration officials in a wide variety of investigations. politico's andrew desiderio and heather caygle report: [ocasio-cortez], rashida tlaib (d-mich.), ayanna pressley (d-mass.) and ro khanna (d-calif.) won spots on the high-profile committee on tuesday … rep. elijah cummings (d-md.), the chairman of the oversight committee, dismissed concerns about the outspoken freshman lawmakers. 'if i based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, i probably wouldn't have a committee,' cummings said.
in his study, my father kept figurines of union gen. ulysses s. grant and confederate gen. robert e. lee standing atop wall-mounted displays. as a half-black, half-white child, i had trouble understanding his reverence for both sides. he told me he was captivated by this period of time when the american experiment nearly failed. and he loved learning about the characters of the war and the multitudes they led, scores of poor white men who stood little to gain from the abolishment or continuation of slavery, yet for varying reasons were willing to die for their side's cause. alex wondered what side he would've ended up on, having grown up in virginia. he couldn't rule out the confederacy. big, sweeping political movements influence people to make decisions in spite of their moral compasses, he reasoned. you can only fight so hard against the tide.
boko haram has been especially destructive in northeast nigeria, waging a brutal campaign to take control of large parts of the country. in 2017 alone, the group killed 900 people and carried out more than 900 attacks. the lawmakers who met with the girls already know those statistics. ya kaka and hauwa offered a more personal account of what happened. they talked, too, about their dreams: to finish school, then go into public service. the gathering captured the emotional dichotomies of the occasion: washington elite and survivors of sex slavery; opportunity and profound loss.
disheartened: i agree. this man's love story spelled heartbreak for others.
now that i've seen them, i think i'm going to miss them that much more, rimland said. but i'm good at compartmentalization. i'm going to stay focused on work, and bonding with my dog. it's not the pinnacle of living. but i can be happy. i'm day-to-day happy for now.
each step feels precious, he said. each wave to each passing car seems important. each small discussion with neighbors about compost and maple syrup seems to add ballast, so the world won't sink under its misery.
i give you credit for not blaming your husband for this or inventing faults to justify your feelings. this is an opportunity, really, to reassess your life (personal and professional).
viewer, those are not wine grapes. those are table grapes being stomped, crushed and danced on beneath kelsey and peter's feet. iowa is not exactly known for its viticulture — and yet kelsey takes peter to a winery for their hometown date. perhaps this is a chance for kelsey to make up for her champagne crisis earlier this season, and there are moments of class. their toes in a tub of grapes, peter dips kelsey as if they're gliding on a dance floor, not ankle-deep in fruit. later, they create their own bottle of wine, which we hope is drawn from grapes untouched by toenail fungus.
that means the cost of indulging your husband is two or three hours. are you okay with that, yes or no? you decide for yourself, of course, but that doesn't sound too awful to me.
the planned psa aims to erode stubbornly robust american skepticism about coronavirus vaccines.
while i love her and want to continue the relationship, i can't help but think the foundation of our marriage isn't solid enough to last, and i'm getting deeply hurt in the process. how much is enough? is this worth trying to salvage, or should i try to minimize the damage to both of us and move on?
please note that a newer resolution, or portion of a resolution, may have superseded an earlier resolution on the same subject.
trump appointees vetted celebrities for the public health campaign based on whether they had ever criticized the president, or supported former president [obama], gay rights or same-sex marriage, reported my colleague yasmeen abutaleb.

-- trump tweeted that he has directed sanders not to bother with press briefings. from john wagner: sanders has not provided an on-camera briefing for more than a month, including the duration of the partial government shutdown. 'the reason sarah sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press,' trump said on twitter. ... olivier knox, president of the white house correspondents association, said in a statement that the trump administration's move 'sets a terrible precedent.'
cheney's recent actions helped mend a family rift. she was once criticized by her sister, mary, who is openly gay and married, for opposing same-sex marriage.
but even in her worst movies, kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. and the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: she won an oscar for her portrayal of virginia woolf in the hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry tv journalist in to die for, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.
one night last week, after a solid 14 days by himself, rimland gave himself a present — a visit in person with his sister and her family, who had also been home for 14 days.

the vikings hired a pair of attorneys to investigate kluwe's allegations about priefer's comments and the reasons for the punter's release. in a july 2014 report they noted that the team's long snapper at the time, cullen loeffler, told them he also heard priefer talk about putting all the gays on an island and nuking it. for the attorneys, that provided an important piece of corroboration, although they wrote that no other witnesses they interviewed recalled hearing any remarks of that nature by priefer.
confused: your question prompted me to do some reading on the whole nurse-police officer dating nexus, and my casual research reveals that, yes, nurses and cops can make great partners. both professions seem to draw plucky, hard-working people who are drawn toward service, and can tolerate challenging shift work.
he said he is surprised his disciplinary case is still open while others have been put on pause.
resolved, that biden's proposals demonstrate his deep belief in the promise and purpose of public education, higher education and the labor movement. he understands healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and was instrumental in the passage of the affordable care act. he championed the violence against women act and led the administration's fight for marriage equality. biden's healthcare plans will make healthcare more affordable by offering a public option for families and reigning in drug companies to make medicine affordable. he will fight to make it easier for workers who choose to unionize to do so and has adopted plans to reform bankruptcy laws for struggling families. he will strengthen and invest in public schools, including by tripling funding for title i, fully funding the individuals with disabilities education act, expanding community schools, investing in school infrastructure and doubling the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers and other health professionals in our schools; limit testing; support educators; and invest in higher education and make college affordable, including by establishing a title i for postsecondary education, investing in public colleges and universities and historically black colleges and universities, strengthening public service loan forgiveness and income-based repayment, and making public colleges and universities free for most families. these plans stand in stark contrast to the betsy devos agenda to defund and destroy public education. biden's education plans are informed by his wife, jill, who has been a teacher her entire career, even while biden served as vice president; and

as the scope of the destruction became apparent, i spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: 'how can i help?' obama said with his two predecessors at his side in the rose garden. in the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do — individuals, corporations, ngos [nongovernmental organizations] and institutions.
peter runs with the wine analogies, describing his relationship with kelsey as very bold with a hint of spice. it's that perfect blend that keeps you wanting to come back, he tells the camera. which might be believable if they were in california, oregon, even virginia. but in iowa, the analogies are the ultimate tell: peter won't be subscribing to this wine club.
let's say a drive is seven hours, where flying instead would involve 30 minutes to the airport, a 90-minute cushion for parking and security, a one-hour flight and another hour on the ground at your destination — so, four hours. call it five to be generous and allow for delays and other hassles of air travel.
ensz, whose ministry at george mason is ecumenical, said that because this was his first offense, he doesn't expect his credentials to be pulled. if they were, ensz might be able to seek credentials from a different conference. because his ministry is ecumenical, it would probably still keep him on staff, he said.

she and her father have had an up-and-down relationship with trump that turned toxic. as she heard trump and many of her colleagues declare several weeks ago that congress should seek to challenge the electoral college results, she sat down to write a 21-page memo warning republicans against the effort.
besides the fact that he is my supervisor, we are also both married. for four years i have attempted to push down, ignore, cover up, rationalize and in every other way remove my feelings from my heart and mind. obviously there is no future for us, and i can't figure out why i can't just accept the attraction and move on.
veronica: i got there early. i'm always early. he was just a little late, and he said that time management was one of his issues.

i went ballistic, he said. an unnecessary extra trip — for what? and when her boyfriend brought over a tray of food he made to celebrate their two-month anniversary, i went into lecture mode, droning about how long the virus can last on surfaces, manheimer said. is it paranoia if you are on high alert about whose air your child might breathe?

but there's another dangerous ex lurking. a woman in a jean jacket approaches peter at the concert with information about victoria. she used to date our protagonist. though her face is blurred out, she already came forward to us weekly. her name is merissa pence. the magazine doesn't manage to extract many more details about victoria's crimes from her than the vague accusation pence lobs in person, telling him: i don't think you deserve what you're on a date with right now. victoria has allegedly broken up relationships. in us weekly, pence says that victoria threatened to slash her tires.

-- lawmakers agreed … to more show votes that probably won't end the government shutdown. the senate will vote tomorrow on competing measures from trump and democrats. both are expected to fail. erica werner, john wagner and jeff stein report: the result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck friday. trump's proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the white house, would open the government through sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. but it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and democrats who were already united against funding trump's wall described these asylum provisions tuesday as a new poison pill. the democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. that would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite democrats have been demanding. …
hot on the left: passenger confronts gop congressman over flying first class during shutdown, from huffpost: [a] republican lawmaker had an uncomfortable run-in tuesday when a fellow airplane passenger found him flying first class from chicago to washington, d.c., according to a video of the encounter shared with huffpost. 'congressman, do you think it's appropriate to fly first class while 57 tsa agents aren't being paid?' the person says to rep. rodney davis (r-ill.), in an apparent reference to [tsa's] 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay. … davis remained silent, prompting the person to say, 'taking that as a yes.' hot on the right: gop strategist blasts stephen miller, says 'maybe someday he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' from fox news: rick wilson, the strategist, was on msnbc's 'all in with chris hayes' and was discussing miller's behind-the-scenes influence over [trump's] immigration policies. there's something deeply wrong with stephen miller… and maybe someday, he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' wilson said, in response to hayes criticism that miller's hard-line views on immigration are what's driving the ongoing government shutdown.

she won the post by arguing that republicans needed to change their messaging and be more aggressive. soon she was launching all-out assaults, saying in march 2019 on nbc's meet the press that democrats were the party of anti-semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism.
for the yankees, the secondary mission was keeping lemahieu's average annual value — $15 million, as it turns out — low enough to allow room for the addition of a starting pitcher while still keeping their 2021 payroll below the luxury tax threshold of $210 million. the yankees may have made their move later friday, when they reportedly agreed to a one-year contract with right-hander corey kluber, a two-time al cy young winner. the trendy phrase of this offseason is financial flexibility, and the yankees — despite being on the hook for more than a half a billion dollars to giancarlo stanton and gerrit cole through 2028 — achieved a measure of it with the lemahieu deal.
you two should plan only the wedding you know you can afford.
a few months ago, i was in her hometown and she came to my hotel. we had a few drinks and spent the night together. recently, i was at a convention she also attended, and we spent the week together. we virtually skipped the convention and just enjoyed each other's company.

ask about how their town has changed, where else they have lived, what grocery stores were like when they were little, what team sports they played, what the worst weather event was that they can remember, stuff like that. once they get going on a topic that is comfortable for them, they may reveal far more than if they are asked directly to articulate their feelings.
his first marriage, to writer ruth slotkin, ended in divorce. survivors include his wife of 57 years, the former sulochana raghavan of cambridge; three daughters from his first marriage, sophie glazer of stuart, fla., and elizabeth glazer and glazer khedouri, both of manhattan; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

-- the d.c. council voted to override mayor muriel bowser's veto of a bill to decriminalize metro fare evasion. faiz siddiqui reports: the 11-to-2 vote to override the veto — bowser's second in office — means the legislation now heads to congress for final review. … bowser expressed concern about the impact the legislation could have on metro's bottom line, arguing it could exacerbate the agency's revenue problems and create potential safety issues. … but the council overruled the mayor's objections and rejected her argument that lessening the penalties for fare-jumping would encourage potential lawlessness and make metro less safe.

i don't know how to bring this up to my family. i wonder what their reactions will be. i'm sort of afraid to say anything to them about it.
i feel justified after so many years of abuse and sacrifice that i deserve to chase my own dreams.
trump is now spending his final days in office fomenting insurrection and giving medals to sports figures. but the arizona gop debacle, and the obsession with demonizing a revered, deceased leader, show the lasting damage trump has done to the party. in place of mccain, the faces of the state party are now gosar and biggs, who along with alabama's rep. mo brooks allegedly organized last week's protest-turned-riot.
friday, finally, is immigration day. biden will sign executive orders focused on border processing and refugee policies, as well as establish a family reunification task force.

curious: my opinion is that you are lonely for companionship, and so you want to test the waters by returning to a familiar lost love.
by that measure, it is welcome to have created equal: clarence thomas in his own words, for which thomas and his wife, virginia, sat with filmmaker michael pack for more than 30 hours of interviews. structured around this conventional talking-head footage — which covers, in easily digestible if inertly chronological fashion, thomas's georgia childhood, education, first marriage and career — the film reveals much, while at the same time leaving us to wonder much. a lot of this ground has been covered before, in thomas's 2007 memoir my grandfather's son, from which thomas occasionally reads aloud.
his other signature work, beyond the melting pot (1963), was one of the first serious studies of ethnicity and assimilation. written with daniel patrick moynihan, the scholar turned u.s. senator, the book examined black, puerto rican, jewish, italian and irish populations in new york city. america, the writers found, was less a melting pot than a mosaic, in which the identities of different racial and ethnic groups persisted generations after their arrival in the united states.
it shouldn't be a partisan issue to make sure that weapons are not in the hands of people who pose a threat, especially when the threat is to their own safety or their family's safety, northam said.

tuesday night, rep. matt rosendale (r-mont.) called for cheney to step down as the chair of the house republican conference. she is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead, he said in a statement.
in early january, leaders in the united methodist church tentatively agreed to spin off a traditionalist methodist denomination that would continue to oppose same-sex marriage and decline ordination to lgbt clergy — allowing the remaining portion of the united methodist church to permit same-sex marriage and lgbt clergy for the first time in its history. the plan will be voted on at the church's denomination-wide conference in may.

the proposal between methodist leaders outlining a future split suggested that clergy who conduct same-sex marriages should remain in good standing and that any judicial processes should be put on hold as of jan. 1.
at least hundreds of national guard troops were forced to sleep in parking garages after being booted thursday from the u.s. capitol complex following their job to secure biden's inauguration in the wake of the jan. 6 riots. i've never in my entire career felt like i've been booted onto the curb and told, 'figure it out on your own,'  said one of the soldiers, who said he served in iraq and afghanistan. some troops are headed home, while others have apparently been returned to the capitol complex, after an uproar on social media.
a three-year serious relationship is a major life-event not to disclose, but i don't think it is necessarily a total trust-breaker.
this difference between us makes it hard to plan not only this trip, but also hypothetical future travel. i proposed that i fly with the toddler, which would give me more time to spend with family, and that he drive, if that's his preference. it infuriated him that i would consider abandoning him to drive alone. he seems to think the only answer is that we both do the road trip thing, which i do not think makes sense.
when the u.s. embassy in cambodia criticized ruler hun sen for cracking down on the opposition and the media, the authoritarian leader pointed out that trump had his back — not the diplomats.
how can i work out these feelings? honestly, it's become exhausting. is leaving my job the only way?
tuesday is equity day, which includes a push to eliminate private prisons. this week, biden removed trump's 1776 report, a u.s. history review lambasted by historians as racist and false published on monday, from the trump[ white house website . biden also disbanded the trump commission that wrote it, valerie strauss reports website

the self-destructive madness can be traced to the 2019 election of kelli ward (r-wackadoodle) as state gop chairwoman. under the leadership of ward — a two-time loser of republican senate primaries, one against mccain — the party embraced election conspiracy theories: it called for the state legislature to de-certify the false results, and when the state's republican gov. doug ducey, an erstwhile trump ally, defended the count, ward tweeted that ducey should #sthu — shut the hell up.
that might be enough of an explanation for your mother, but you should ask yourself if this is really right for you.

after the election, with liz cheney winning a house seat at the same time trump captured the presidency, trump baldly tried to win the cheney family's goodwill. he pardoned the elder cheney's former chief of staff, i. lewis scooter libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. trump said liz cheney had pushed for the pardon.
soon, however, cheney and trump were at political war.

a post reporter panned the brazilian president's performance at the forum:
especially since the nature of the dream matters. parents live away from minor children plenty, for reasons society accepts and even applauds. military deployments; diplomatic or political positions; humanitarian aid work; career necessity (astronauts, journalists, mountaineers, ship captains); economic pressure — anything from a job transfer to emigration from an impoverished country.

the vice president expressed support for anti-government demonstrations in venezuela:
it seems to miss manners that such a couple alone can define the relationship. if they are affianced, they must mean something slightly different from the term now available to committed but unmarried couples, who call themselves partners. meanwhile, the rest of us should look for our champagne elsewhere.
the state party is apparently one-upping the maricopa county gop, which on saturday censured jeff flake (arizona's last elected republican senator, who retired after denouncing trump) but was prevented by parliamentary reasons from adding cindy mccain to the resolution.
with this deal, both sides also achieved their secondary mission. for lemahieu, 32, that meant securing a guaranteed figure — $90 million — that represents by far the largest in baseball this offseason (though trevor bauer, george springer or j.t. realmuto eventually could exceed it) and one that comes close to the $92 million third baseman josh donaldson (over four years) received from the minnesota twins a year ago. the latter was thought to be lemahieu's target at the start of the free agent signing period.
on her birthday on march 29, there were lemon cakes. her husband grilled steaks and she watched her grandbabies play in the waning afternoon sunshine. then they sang to her.
about three months ago my wife told me she was unsure about our relationship. she said the reason she fell in love with me was because i would make a good father, but since kids aren't immediately on the horizon, she feels i don't give her enough energy as a couple, and that, while she loves me, she has felt more in love with previous boyfriends. this would have been great to hear before we got married.

with one side selling products online and the other delivering goods and people, the natural symbiosis would appear to be through logistics in a sprawling country that spans 5,100 kilometers (3,200 miles) across about 18,000 islands. that's the kind of end-to-end infrastructure that companies like amazon.com inc. dream about.

the move is the leading edge of pushback from within the irs, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take actions that could slow or cripple government functions as the political stalemate continues in washington. u.s. department of agriculture meat inspectors have begun to call in sick, transportation security administration sickouts at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents and affecting investigations. … not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on employees across the government, but especially on those who are not in high-salary jobs. the employees summoned back from furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority.
the bipartisan bonhomie is a stark departure from trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. his health and human services department crafted a never-aired $250 million campaign to defeat despair featuring celebrities like dennis quaid, which was criticized for being designed to boost trump's reelection chances.
i'm on teams for calls, like, eight or nine times a day, willett said. you end up thinking about the level of priority of the calls, to figure out which ones we can have the baby in the background screaming during the call, and which ones we can't.
cheney criticized trump's handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president's resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. after trump said i appreciate support from qanon, the conspiracy theory group, cheney called it a dangerous lunacy.
if it happens multiple times, then my opinion becomes that the recipient of your generosity is either an ingrate or highly socially awkward. and then you face a decision: is this person's company worth the price you have to pay for it, literally and figuratively?

which is why this wretched thing might be good for you. when your wife married you for the wrong reasons — i take her word for all this, i should emphasize, and draw no conclusions of my own — she stopped your search for that woman.
one day he left his email open on our shared computer, and i discovered its primary purpose — to secretly communicate with another woman. she is a younger woman and happily married, so there's not a romantic relationship. however, by the tone of his messages and some of his remarks, it is obvious that he is very smitten.

antonia was the daughter of a respected man in poltava, ukraine, who navigated through a devastating famine in 1933 only to see his family and community torn apart with the nazi invasion in 1941. her arrival in the united states must have been an instant blow to her pride: she worked as a maid, cleaning the homes of rich, white families while living with them. she relied on government assistance in a foreign country. my father suspected she dated mostly for financial reasons; she had two young boys to support and no hope for them to attend college without a partner's income or help from the government.
kidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent hbo series big little lies can attest. the stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak tv hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included reese witherspoon, laura dern, zoë kravitz, shailene woodley and kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. kidman — who co-produced with witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.
there had been a strain of mccain antipathy within the arizona party well before trump, who served in the first bone spurs division during vietnam and attacked mccain's heroism for years, even posthumously. meanwhile, a younger, multiracial electorate has been gradually turning against republicans in the state, as in texas, georgia and north carolina.

impeachment is inching ahead. senate majority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) will deliver the article of impeachment against trump on monday. it will be a full trial, it will be a fair trial, schumer said during remarks on the senate floor, wagner reports.
but i haven't really focused on her as much as i should have, said moscatt, 88, a figure painter and portrait artist. he still leaves home most days to drive eight minutes to his creative home, a third-floor studio in baltimore's retro-chic cork factory building. but now his subject is the woman he would ordinarily come home to each evening.

it is not professional (or polite) to address a group of colleagues — where at least one is a woman — as gentlemen.
republicans say the chances trump will be convicted in his next impeachment trial are plummeting. a maximum of five or six gop senators may vote for impeachment, the hill reports. i thought if he pardoned people who had been part of this invasion of the capitol, that would have pushed the number higher because that would have said, 'these are my guys,' said one republican senator. another said trump's supporters would be very upset if the party moved to convict him, a base the gop needs ahead of the 2022 midterms.

the whole story, which had been the stuff of wild rumors for weeks, originated with the spurned ex-husband, who told kmov that the relationship between greitens and the man's then-wife had led to the breakup of their marriage.
states that emphasized such programs did not always see results, he found, particularly in the realm of education. in dr. glazer's view, those initiatives discouraged self-sufficiency and were incapable of addressing the real issue: a deterioration of the family and other social units fundamental to american life.
dear amy: i've had a friend from work for 25 years. we solved problems together, griped about conditions, lunched and played tennis. we retired and have remained friends, albeit with less get-together time.
on thursday, my dad was cremated; his ashes will be interred at arlington national cemetery, on the former grounds of robert e. lee's plantation. he'll rest alongside thousands of men who, like him, had ideas about what this country ought to stand for and were willing to die for that vision, however flawed.

the committee then went on to consider a proposal from sen. adam p. ebbin (d-alexandria) to remove the state's defunct gay-marriage ban from the state constitution. the ban has been unconstitutional since the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide. the plan from ebbin, who in 2003 became the state's first openly gay legislator, would have put the matter to a referendum.
she planned to be home in may. they had it all set, in terms of how many times we would visit each other, and we'd be texting and all that fun stuff, said lohman, 31.
it's clear from friday's incident on the mall that the young men who confronted the native american protester had somehow internalized that their behavior was acceptable. it's hard to read from that one scenario how they look at issues of race more broadly. but if part of the incident on the mall reflected opposition to diversity, those views would be in the minority.
anyway, they go to one of those touristy old-timey photo booths, where you put on petticoats and top hats and try not to think too hard about how long it's been since the photo place washed the costumes. they pose for a photo. buxton is the only one who seems happy. they have ice cream and walk into a producer-arranged impromptu concert from hunter hayes, another country singer who, thankfully, victoria has not dated. somewhere, chase rice lets out a deep, wearied sigh.
-- trump, like many of his advisers, has grown tired of giuliani's gaffe-prone media appearances frequently requiring the ex-mayor to walk back his comments, politico's eliana johnson and darren samuelsohn report: trump was apoplectic after a pair of weekend media interviews by his personal lawyer, in which giuliani said that the president had been involved in discussions to build a trump tower in moscow through the end of the 2016 campaign … trump spent much of sunday and monday fuming to aides and friends about his lawyer's missteps. … giuliani's public remarks — typically made in sporadic clusters of freewheeling media interviews — have long exasperated white house aides, including the president's in-house lawyer handling the russia investigation, emmet flood. … asked who in the white house is responsible for handling giuliani's missteps, a white house aide said, 'handling rudy's f--- ups takes more than one man.'
consider this the first test of your marriage. if you and your fiance tackle this together, you will have the benefit of each other's assistance when trying to raise the money for your nuptials. if your mother isn't in the mix, your father may be more inclined to contribute, and if your future husband takes the lead in approaching his family, they may pony up. the best way to do this is respectfully — and in person.

reschman, 57, was trapped in an anxiety dream the other night. she was screaming but she didn't know it. her husband, noel, 61, shook her awake. esther got a glass of water and, at 3 a.m., started her day.
while conservatives lambasted him, suggesting he had sold out in the face of pressure from liberal colleagues, dr. glazer insisted he was once again changing his views only in the face of shifting evidence. he had never abandoned his ideals, he said, only adjusted his thinking on how best to achieve them.
reschman has not left her south san antonio home except to pick up groceries curbside or try to clear her head with a slow drive down roosevelt avenue. she has found relief in art. noel fixed up the living room with a desk where she keeps her paint and other materials; she embosses and paints aluminum from old beer cans, making sacred hearts, roses and other pop art. she had always wanted to make her own clothes, so she watches youtube and recalls her mother's design patterns, sewing dresses, blouses and purses made of old blue jeans.

the idea of bringing the three former presidents together to film the handover-of-power video came from stephanie cutter, a veteran democratic operative who served as an executive producer of biden's inauguration, the sources said.
the report also stated that the special teams coach initially denied to investigators that he made any inappropriate remarks about the lgbtq community or marriage equality, and that he categorically denied making the nuke comment. however, when presented with loeffler's recollection, priefer said he was not going to disagree with it.
at that point, per the report, priefer told investigators, it was a joke between three people, three men.
when my parents married in 1987, antonia gathered most of my father's childhood pictures and destroyed them. with what few she didn't burn, she scrawled nigger lover in black marker over each image, put them in an envelope and mailed them to my parents.
it reminds me of the old leninist line, he added:  'who says a, must say b.' from saying b, you'll go on to c, d and you'll end up at z. there's no stopping.
-- michael bloomberg, who is weighing a presidential bid leaning on his centrist image, emphasized the importance of compromise in an annapolis speech. rachel chason reports: he gave the keynote speech tuesday at a leadership conference at the u.s. naval academy in annapolis, praising the late senator john mccain — an academy alumnus — for his independence and willingness to work across the aisle. … following meetings with maryland lawmakers and state attorney general brian e. frosh (d), bloomberg spoke at a news conference about the importance of 'balancing' different priorities. he called the partial federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, a 'disgrace.' 'you can't be an absolutist . . . life is much more complex than that,' he said. … asked about the timing of an announcement about 2020, bloomberg said: 'well, i said i'd take a look at it in january, february. we're still in january.'
rigor, range and — most crucially — curiosity: just as admirable as the performances have been kidman's choices when it comes to material and the filmmakers she wants to work with.

the successes in this past year have come about not because i, or you legislators, did something individually — but because we worked together, he said. when we work together and help provide a strong foundation for virginians, our families and businesses thrive.
some time ago, he created a separate email address for himself. i didn't give it much thought.
i wanted to share with you some statements that are important in light of news you may have seen tonight. a statement from james f. bennett, our attorney: the governor has now seen the tv report that ran tonight. the station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story, which contained multiple false allegations. the claim that this nearly three-year old story has generated or should generate law enforcement interest is completely false. there was no 'blackmail,' and that claim is false. this personal matter has been addressed by the governor and mrs. greitens privately years ago when it happened. the outrageous claims of improper conduct regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie. joint statement from sheena and i: a few years ago, before eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. this was a deeply personal mistake. eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately. while we never would have wished for this pain in our marriage, or the pain that this has caused others, with god's mercy sheena has forgiven and we have emerged stronger. we understand that there will be some people who cannot forgive — but for those who can find it in your heart, eric asks for your forgiveness, and we are grateful for your love, your compassion, and your prayers.
of course, if lemahieu becomes unproductive in the late stages of his career, the yankees, with their vast resources, can afford to carry him — particularly at such a relatively low salary. but it is still jarring, in the age of financial flexibility, to see a team overextend in terms of years to sign a player who is soon entering his mid-30s, and it is a safe assumption that, all other things considered, the yankees would have preferred a shorter deal. just as lemahieu chose guaranteed dollars over aav, the yankees chose the opposite.
i wish more people had recognized that it was just as hard on her. love is a beautiful but dangerous thing because it makes us invest of ourselves in others. when they suffer, so do we. when we suffer, so do they.

-- sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of south carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. annie linskey and david weigel report: 'racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. the changes from sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. in 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. this week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, sanders called [trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. he spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.
hannah ann, to her credit, doesn't share our skepticism with the gesture. to the contrary, she so admires the trope that she had composed a similar document for him in an earlier episode. as she tells her sister, when he gave it to me i was like —. here, her mouth hangs open. as the literary theorist roland barthes might put it, the pleasure of the text is clearest when it falls silent. or when we do. or something.
but with few exceptions, republicans sat stone-faced as northam called for dialogue about gun safety and ending the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court costs. his call to allow early voting seemed to fall especially flat on that side of the aisle, particularly as he tied prohibitive barriers to voting to the state's history of slavery. so did his call to add language to the state code declaring that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health-care decisions.
if you really are just talking about dream-fulfillment beyond your current perfection, then your decision feels heavily optional. like, second-cherry-on-a-sundae optional. i'd say this about any dad or mom who has viable and non-soul-crushing local employment options and whose affected child is just 12.
i won't give away the ending, but ultimately the episode becomes not an indictment of dating apps like tinder but an endorsement of them. in a story that starts by telling its characters to hand over their free will to the supremacy of technology, it ends up melding the two. yes, the app puts two people together, but they still have to make choices to be happy.

that accusation was made by ex-punter chris kluwe in a january 2014 essay he wrote for deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by minnesota after eight seasons with the team. kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.

no sooner had kidman delivered a powerhouse with big little lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: in queen of the desert, out friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer gertrude bell, a contemporary of t.e. lawrence who traveled the arabian peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after world war i. written and directed by werner herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, queen of the desert isn't a great film. in fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of lawrence of arabia notwithstanding. but none of its faults lie with kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of spf-50 sunscreen).
it admonishes her for supporting leftist causes such as gay marriage. it scolds her for endorsing biden, in direct opposition to … the constitution. it upbraids her for objecting to trump's criticism of her husband — and then it repeats such slander, saying the late senator, a war hero and pow, committed serious wrongdoing during his military service.

-- trump's legislative affairs director, shahira knight, is looking to leave the administration, politico's eliana johnson and nancy cook report: knight's talk of exiting a job she took less than seven months ago comes as she plays what some call a thankless role in talks between [trump] and capitol hill lawmakers skeptical of cutting a deal [to end the shutdown] with her erratic boss. in recent weeks, she has taken a back seat to the stepped-up efforts of vice president mike pence and trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, jared kushner.

dear carolyn: my husband and i are deciding whether to have kids. we live in an expensive city far away from any family. no one has visited us in the four years we've lived here.
hi, carolyn: my husband and i will be traveling to attend my mom's wedding. it's either a 13-hour drive (now that we have a child, it would probably actually eat up an entire day) or a 1½ -hour flight, plus brief transportation at each end. my husband hates to fly — mostly because he is frugal and dislikes being shuffled around by airlines, but he also has slight confinement anxiety. he has a prescription for this when he absolutely has to fly, and it works well.

-- trump is preparing two versions of his state of the union address, even if nancy pelosi declines to invite him to the house chamber and he is forced to give the speech somewhere else. seung min kim reports: the administration is trying to conduct advance work to prepare for an address in the house chamber, originally scheduled for jan. 29, even though pelosi has the power to determine whether trump can do so. … it's unclear what options for venues the white house is exploring aside from the house chamber, where state of the union addresses have been delivered since president woodrow wilson's speech in 1913. on tuesday, the speaker of the north carolina house of representatives, tim moore, said trump called him to thank him for offering the raleigh legislature as a venue. trump told moore in the phone call monday evening, which lasted for about 10 minutes, that his staff was still determining where the address would be delivered. trump also called lee chatfield, the speaker of the michigan house of representatives, who similarly offered up the chambers in lansing.

by september 2015, a new york architect had completed plans for a bold glass obelisk 100 stories high, to be topped by a gleaming, cut-diamond–like shape emblazoned on multiple sides with the trump logo. … the trump team would also have the option to 'brand all or any portion of the spa or fitness facilities' as 'the spa by ivanka trump,' according to the plans. … the top residence of the moscow tower, enjoying a view without equal in all the continent, was to be a gleaming penthouse, the most luxurious property in a seriously luxurious building. a show-stopping apartment like that could have been marketed for $50 million. but as buzzfeed news reported in november, trump's fixers planned not to sell it — but to give it away for free, to none other than vladimir putin himself.

technically, tebow omitted antarctica, which is understandable, and australia, which is a bit more odd, given that he has a close connection to the relatively nearby philippines. also, some scientists are pushing for the recognition of an eighth continent, zealandia, so tebow might need to further expand his brood.

'due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the people's control,' they requested a fourth continuance in the [francis] williams murder trial.

-- barnes, our scotus beat reporter, notes the decision to grand cert on the gun case may provide the most insight yet about where the conservative majority will take the court: the speculation had been that neither conservatives nor liberals knew whether they could count on the vote of the court's median justice, anthony m. kennedy. the court turned aside numerous challenges to restrictions on the kinds of guns that could be purchased, and whether they could be carried outside the home. after one such decision in 2018, a frustrated justice clarence thomas wrote that 'as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the second amendment is a disfavored right in this court.' but, [law professor adam] winkler said, 'there is no hesitancy in justice kavanaugh,' who replaced kennedy and has an expansive view of gun rights.

dr. glazer sometimes traced the pivotal moment in his intellectual evolution — his mugged by reality moment, as it were — to the 1960s, when he became disillusioned with the student free speech movement while teaching at berkeley. but that was just the beginning of a career spent grappling with the chief tenets of the left and the right.

last year, writing about actress isabelle huppert in the new republic, the critic miriam bale noted that in the movie elle, huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. the same, writ even larger, could be said for kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. in an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer. (check out the flawed, weird but wonderfully woman-centric erotic thriller in the cut for an early example of the latter.)
there's a particularly ugly convention in romantic comedies that finds the male protagonist fighting for a woman's affection by listing all the things he loves about her. inevitably, as words spill out of his mouth, he starts enumerating behaviors that clearly irritate him, activities that are usually gendered in one way or another: he loves that she always takes exactly 53 minutes to pick out her entree, no matter how many times she's been to the restaurant. he loves that she always wears three sweaters to the office, even though her male colleagues seem just fine with the temperature. he loves that they're always late to meet his friends because she takes so long to get ready.
bearded, baggy-eyed, habitually high on drugs or alcohol, stone cut a curious figure at catered cocktail parties. he resembled an avatar of old key west, a shrimper or deep-sea fisherman, a hell raiser temporarily ashore squandering his pay and his health. but he didn't behave like an island brawler. his bruises and scars came from falling down or stumbling into plate glass doors, not from fighting. he seldom raised his voice — which was surprisingly patrician — and rarely cut short his autodidactic monologues. although a college dropout with a ged high school degree, he possessed arcane knowledge of religion, art, literature and history. stone's most striking feature, however, was his hands — not big work-roughened mitts, but soft palms and the gentlest grip of any man i've ever met.

not only is she expecting me and my boyfriend to pay gobs of money to attend the destination wedding that she can't afford, but she has also been messaging my boyfriend behind my back (my boyfriend is showing me the messages), saying how she can't wait for the wedding — so my boyfriend can see her in a bikini.
monday is buy american  day, and biden will sign an order beefing up requirements for government purchases of u.s. goods and services.
greitens, 43, is a relatively new star in the republican party who boasts an extraordinary résumé: former navy seal and lt. commander, attended duke university on scholarship; rhodes scholar at oxford; phd, author and white house fellow during the administration of president george w. bush. he is the author of resilience: hard-won wisdom for living a better life and, according to a profile in st. louis magazine, has had presidential aspirations since he was a young man. his wife, sheena chestnut greitens, is an assistant professor of political science at the university of missouri, and a nonresident senior fellow at the center for east asian policy studies at the brookings institution in washington.
democrats and republicans alike cheered and rose at a few points during northam's 50-minute speech, such as when he called for extending broadband access to rural areas and pledged to make the state the best for business.
well, sad is right! she is not the woman she was 30 years ago. i wish you'd pointed that out.
biden's inaugural committee felt both for small-d democratic purposes but also aligned with joe biden's values and message, we are going to restore confidence in government again, or at least build some of it back, the source continued. that posed a challenge given the absence of the outgoing president, who plays a pretty starring role in inauguration day — the greeting at the white house — the whole nine yards.
what do you want for lunch? esther yells through the back door.
ya kaka was kidnapped at 16, along with her two sisters. hauwa was 15 when boko haram fighters stormed her family's thatched-roof home. her parents were killed. she was taken. this public advocacy will make both women targets at home. ya kaka will have to move to a new city, where no one knows her past. she says it's worth it.
it is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the house, said brendan buck, a former aide to house speaker john a. boehner. she is turning the page on donald trump. i think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.
stuart stevens, a political consultant who worked with liz cheney during both bush-cheney campaigns and recently wrote a book in which he predicted she would run for president, said she has become the de facto leader of the republican party, which he said should be distinguished from what he called the pro-trump authoritarian party.
because stone knew i had been a friend of graham greene, whom he loathed, we danced around that subject. it was a shame, i thought, since greene and stone had so much in common — disorder and early sorrow, a weakness for drink and drugs, and an enduring interest in women, all tidily packaged in catholic guilt.
they watch westworld together. they talk about their day and their dog. and sometimes about how very alone they are, because husband and wife are 2,700 miles apart, stuck on opposite coasts.

primarily written by david riesman, with contributions from reuel denney and dr. glazer, the book proposed three character types with which to divide society — other-directed, inner-directed and tradition-directed — and was widely seen as a swipe at american consumerism and conformity.
a self-described mild radical in the 1950s, dr. glazer was part of a group of left-leaning thinkers who were mugged by reality, in journalist irving kristol's formulation, and turned against the social programs of president lyndon b. johnson's great society initiative in the 1960s.
bennett, greitens's lawyer, said in his statement that there was nothing about the relationship that has generated or should generate law enforcement interest.
it's a long shot, but maybe, too, it'll help her see you differently. good news for you either way, if painfully achieved.
as biden readies his immigration plan, republicans are already fundraising off their opposition to it:
-- the trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. barnes reports: last week, u.s. district judge jesse m. furman of new york ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. furman said commerce secretary wilbur ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. normally, the justice department's next stop would be the u.s. court of appeals for the 2nd circuit. but solicitor general noel j. francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the supreme court. 'the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of june 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.
i take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn't feel that you can actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions about it. the idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence — what the science is and know that's it, let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling, fauci said at his first press conference of the biden administration.
here was a woman who had tried to poison her son and failed, who felt so desperate in her inadequacies that she'd effortlessly added american anti-black racism to the european anti-semitism she brought over. she called my mother the n-word, in writing, and i still couldn't hate her. there was some hate there, sure, but the overwhelming emotions were pity and heartbreak. she had done something extraordinary in rescuing my father from postwar europe, instilled in him a tremendous work ethic and — even if it was by accident — a sense of fairness. yet as a consequence of her hate, she didn't get to be a part of the world she helped create for him, and for me.
bishop sharma lewis is bound by oaths she took as both a pastor and a bishop to uphold the book of discipline and she processed both complaints, paul steidler, a spokesman for the bishop, said in a statement.

-- south bend mayor pete buttigieg entered the 2020 democratic primary. cathleen decker reports: buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early wednesday, before taking part in the u.s. conference of mayors meeting in washington, d.c. he announced in december that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. he said wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the democratic field. he turned 37 on saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.
i don't know, he yells back. how about a burrito?
a longtime professor at harvard university, dr. glazer was a co-author of two seminal works of social science. the first, the lonely crowd (1950), is sometimes cited as the most popular work of american sociology.
whereas, the economic harm caused by covid-19 will be particularly devastating to working families. even before the pandemic hit, nearly 40 percent of americans said they couldn't cover a $400 emergency expense. just as franklin d. roosevelt after herbert hoover and the great depression and barack obama and biden after george w. bush and the great recession, this moment calls for a democratic president who has the competence and compassion to not just bring us out of the depths of economic ruin but also rewrite the rules so working families thrive and heal our nation:
alex lohman likes to sing. stuart rimland, her husband, likes to rap. these days, they're combining their talents for an audience of each other.
we talk about everything, share everything and have started talking about a new life together. this would entail us both leaving our spouses.

the former republican senator from indiana, appointed by president trump, has sought to protect the independence of spy agencies to provide candid and cleareyed assessments of what's really going on in the world, especially vis-a-vis the threat posed by vladimir putin's revanchist russia.
the house of delegates was in full history mode, with four honor guards from jamestown in colonial armor — red plumes on their helmets, halberds in hand. cox, a former high school government teacher, offered lofty words about the meaning of the first gathering of representative democracy in 1619 in the new world.
stephen colbert mocked the supreme court's decision to reinstate the transgender troop restrictions:
so would someone please come up with a solution?
i don't think any excuse (except telling her the truth) will get me out of this and still be in her good graces.
in the biography child of light, madison smartt bell captures every aspect of stone's contradictory nature, especially his work ethic. each of stone's novels — from hall of mirrors (1966) through the national book award winning dog soldiers (1974) to his final book, death of the black-haired girl (2013) — was achieved despite the author's crippling depressions, repeated bouts of ill health and unwise dependence on self-medication.
aside from the takeout ventures, rimland, not much of a cook, is living on leftovers and supplies he and his wife had squirreled away ahead of last year's hurricane season.
gathered to watch president biden take the oath of office and film a message emphasizing the ceremony's importance to the republic, they also recorded a psa [public service announcement] aimed at building confidence in the safety and efficacy of the covid vaccine, one of the sources said. that message will be released in the coming weeks, the source added. another source said the psa was a work in progress and confirmed the rough timetable.
alan: i think neither of us felt the wow factor. but she's a gracious lady. she asked to stay in touch, and we swapped numbers.

so when the birthday rolled around last week, allison was feeling sorry for herself, her father said, and he and his wife decided that would not do. he found a recipe for a greek cocktail, the brown volcano, made with brandy, orange juice and vinsanto, a dessert wine from santorini. he drove by a carryout in alexandria, va., and got the ingredients. he set up a bar in the garage — gordon's pub — invited allie to order her ritual first legal drink, and then carded her.

-- the south carolina primary is taking on outsize significance in the 2020 democratic nominating fight. the new york times's jonathan martin and astead w. herndon report: the primary here may still be 405 days away and only fourth on the calendar of early-nominating states, behind iowa, new hampshire and nevada. but at a time when [trump] has stoked racial divisions and black voters have become an increasingly crucial democratic constituency, south carolina is already looming larger at the outset of this race than in any recent democratic nominating contest. … the winner here will enter the march 3 super tuesday contests with a burst of momentum.
respond with statements like, i'm sorry you're so unhappy without assuming responsibility.
yet sympathetic as he is to his subject, bell never softens his focus or smooths over stone's less admirable traits. a great deal of the credit for this candor goes to stone's partner, whom michael herr christened the patron saint of writers' wives. janice stone served as her husband's muse, first reader, typist, cook and caretaker, accountant, travel agent and life coach. unlike so many literary marriages, theirs lasted 55 years, and after stone's death janice remained her husband's helpmate and his biographer's enabler. where other widows might protect a great man's reputation (and perhaps their own financial interest) by destroying unflattering documents or restricting access to diaries and letters, janice set nothing off the record. along with accounts of stone's medications (recreational and otherwise), his stretches in rehab and his suicide attempt, janice provided information about stone's sexual escapades and her own affairs, which he encouraged. they had married young, before the late 60s' sexual liberation, and the stones allowed each other astonishing leeway. stone fathered a child with another woman, and even that didn't alienate janice.
the senate just confirmed lloyd austin, 93 to 2, to become the nation's first black defense secretary
the decision marked an extraordinary denouement for cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party's leadership. she had feuded for months with trump and lately had been at odds with the majority of her caucus, even as speculation mounts about whether she might one day seek the speakership. the move was applauded by those in the party who have urged a clean break with trump.
richard cheney, meanwhile, said in february 2016 that trump sounded like a liberal democrat and that he would not endorse him. but two months later, cnn reported that cheney was breaking with the two former bush presidents, who did not support trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.
victoria, do you think i enjoy this right now? do you think there's any way i couldn't address this? she turns it back on him. you're supposed to meet my family tonight and you decided that what merissa told you is more important than meeting my family? she said. i'm so done with this right now, i can't do this. the last part was addressed to the producers — nothing better than when a contestant breaks the fourth wall! — and she walks away.

-- trump's assistant secretary of state in charge of european affairs, who has overseen u.s. relations with nato and the european union for the past 16 months, announced his resignation. he cited personal and professional reasons. carol morello reports: in september 2017, [a. wess] mitchell became one of the first assistant secretaries of state in the trump administration confirmed by the senate, and his departure creates another vacancy in the ranks of senior officials. currently, six of the 24 spots have nominees awaiting senate confirmation. … in an interview, mitchell said his resignation is not a protest of the administration's policies or the direction of foreign policy, and he praised [mike] pompeo's leadership and vision.
but he then had to issue this mea culpa:
if you are not willing to do this, or are unable to because of your position, you could ask your supervisor or hr representative for suggestions on how to handle this salutation situation. this is not the biggest (or the most sexist) issue you will encounter, but you should react honestly. — may 2015
in announcing a three-game suspension for priefer, the vikings said their organization does not accept, condone or tolerate any type of insensitive or disparaging remarks. priefer expressed regret at the time, and he added, i am extremely sorry, but i will learn from this situation and will work on educating others to create more tolerance and respect.
for example, one couple i know has been engaged for many years (including a ring), but have subsequently moved on with all significant milestones outside of marriage — home, children, major life changes, etc. no mention of marriage arrangements have come up since the initial engagement. so is it still appropriate to refer to them as one another's fiance(e)''?
they posted the whole thing on social media and it went mini-viral, extending the entertainment into the next few days.
i felt so normal, he said. we had conversations like we'd normally have.
i am curious as to where life has taken him. i would like to drop him a note and offer to meet him for coffee and conversation to catch up.
consider the question of whether respondents think racial and ethnic diversity is good, bad or makes no difference. nearly 6 in 10 white males who are in generation z hold the view that racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing, vs. fewer than 4 in 10 white males born before 1946 (the silent generation, per pew's labels). the drop-off is similar across gen z groups, but only among white men are the oldest members more likely to say diversity makes little difference than that it's a good thing.
afterward, the ex-husband went on social media calling greitens a homewrecker, according to kmov. he then tried to go public with his story and with the recording, speaking with both of missouri's major newspapers.

in honduras , president juan orlando hernández backed washington in a vote at the united nations over u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel's capital. then hernández allegedly used fraud to steal an election, triggering mass protests. rather than condemn the move, the united states offered its congratulations.
their stories began in september 2014, when boko haram decimated their city, bama, near the cameroonian border. the assault was gruesome. many of bama's 350,000 residents fled. men who couldn't escape were killed and put in mass graves. thousands of girls and women, some as young as 8, were forced to travel on foot to camps where they became sex slaves.

but the change has been okay. paul has kept the virus out of his art, refusing to let it dominate their conversations. i'm not painting the covid-19 into this painting, he said. then he paused to consider his wife's expression. maybe the virus had made its way into the image: she looks a little like she is angry about it.
-- former white house communications aide cliff sims recounts in his new tell-all that the president offered nasa all the money you could ever need to get an astronaut to mars during his first term. new york magazine's olivia nuzzi reports: the day of [trump's televised call to the international space station in 2017], sims conducted a final briefing in the private dining room with trump, [betsy] devos, [astronaut kate] rubins, and robert lightfoot jr., the acting nasa administrator. … lightfoot explained to the president — who, again, had recently signed a bill containing a plan for mars — that nasa planned to send a rover to mars in 2020 and, by the 2030s, would attempt a manned spaceflight. … sims wrote that [trump] leaned in toward lightfoot and made him an offer. 'but what if i gave you all the money you could ever need to do it?' trump asked. 'what if we sent nasa's budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. could it work then?'
the letter was first reported by dcist.
but the rapture will not come for them yet. no, first peter must be judged, and judged he will be by her father, an elfin-featured man named chad who kicks off peter's visit by leading the whole family in a prayer. madison, as her mother puts it, has made some very specific faith decisions. to put that in plainer language, she is saving herself for marriage, the ostensible endpoint of the bachelor, though certainly not the only destination on pilot pete's flight plan.

dear amy: i am a nurse. i started dating a police officer seven months ago.
after being informed of the president's tirade by her father, cheney walked out on the house floor, still hoping to stop the effort backed by trump to overturn the electoral college votes. then she heard a mob banging on the chamber's doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. she hustled to a secure location and later called fox news.
veronica: i told him i'm a widow. it's been only three years. but i'm good. god is good. i've worked on becoming a full person. and with grief support for a couple of years, it really helped, spiritually, physically, mentally. it's not a difficult conversation now.

peter meets victoria in her hometown of virginia beach, va. her black lab, buxton, is with her, and when she jumps up on him and wraps his legs around him to make out — a move that we've deemed the koala — her dog runs away, into the ocean, without her even noticing. we are all buxton, forever trying to escape the drama, running headlong into the tide.
my mother takes these occasions very seriously and has not responded well to my initial attempts to tell her that i do not want to attend.
an avalanche of competing information ensued and became a perfect encapsulation of what happens when a big hollywood story breaks: every other tabloid scrambles to post stories with their own takes and their own anonymous sources, and it quickly becomes very confusing. how does anyone decipher what is actually going on? (representatives for kardashian and west did not return requests for comment.)
six days earlier, cheney was in the house chamber, urging that republicans reject efforts pushed by trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined trump had lost his reelection bid. she did not know she was being attacked by trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the house cloakroom.
their view was 'because [former president donald] trump's not participating, how do we showcase the passage of power, and how do we visually represent the restoration of norms, another source said, noting the unusual video was weeks in planning.

on becoming a better person for your child:
he received a bachelor's degree in 1944, earned a master's degree in linguistics from the university of pennsylvania that same year, and went on to work as an editor at commentary, anchor books and random house. dr. glazer received his doctorate in sociology from columbia university in 1962 and taught at the university of california at berkeley, bennington college in vermont and smith college in northampton, mass., before joining harvard in 1969.
ten days after the dec. 26, 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami, bush enlisted clinton and george h.w. bush to lead what became a successful a global campaign for private donations. five years later, it was obama's turn to task clinton and the younger bush with collecting aid in the aftermath of an earthquake that devastated much of haiti.
and the 2019 oscar nominations were announced:
before he arrives, things go well: madison takes her gentleman caller to an auburn college basketball court where they are greeted by a prerecorded clip from alumnus charles barkley. the school's coach then leads them in drills where peter struggles to dribble two balls simultaneously. and though peter is terrible at this task, that shouldn't surprise us: he was just as bad at axe-throwing earlier in the episode. after the coach leaves, the couple makes out on the floor of the abandoned court like the last lovers after the rapture.
but: yes. just send them. email if you have to, at the rate of one a week if that's all you can manage. to speed it up, use a template: we're not ungrateful, we're just late, or some such. if you need updated addresses, ask sympathetic family or friends to help.
although he is backing those same bills again, including measures that call for universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban, northam chose to highlight just a single bill in his speech — one that he said republican legislatures in other states have adopted. the extreme risk law would make it easier for law enforcement and the courts to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.
i asked him if we could see each other once every four weeks (because i know he is busy), but he doesn't want that. he says, this is the only way the relationship works.
hours later, peter arrives at victoria's family's home with flowers, but she can sense that something is wrong.

of course, the today show chiming in shouldn't be too surprising: the show is under the nbc news umbrella, which is owned by nbcuniversal — which, as you might know, also owns e!.
nearly two hours after page six's story hit the web, e! online published its offering: why kim kardashian hasn't officially filed for divorce from kanye west, the headline read. the story confirmed that the pair is effectively going their separate ways after a six-year marriage, though an unnamed source explained that kardashian is still waiting before she makes anything official because she wants to make sure she's making the right decision for the kids.

hours after kluwe's essay was published, priefer issued a statement in which he vehemently denied the allegations.
as it inevitably must, the film eventually works its way back to the confirmation hearings, during which sometimes-lurid allegations of sexual harassment were made by attorney anita hill, who once worked with thomas. and thomas again refers to the proceedings as a high-tech lynching, orchestrated because he was the wrong kind of black guy, as he characterizes his opponents' views.
prospective dad: you seem to have put a lot of thought into this, but you don't seem to have done any research about adoption (other than writing to me). becoming a parent (especially a single parent) is a heavy lift. it is emotionally, physically and financially taxing. it is also the greatest and most important thing you will ever do.
as a parent, you know that you don't respond to a tantrum by giving in — you step back and let it run its course. a natural consequence for her ranting and attacking you is that you will not want to take her calls for a period of time.
cheney did not directly answer the question, which foreshadowed elements of the attack on the capitol. look, i don't believe this is right or left, she said. i think this is an issue on which all of us should come together.
after winning reelection in 2018, a year in which republicans lost control of the house, enabling nancy pelosi to become speaker, cheney ran for a post traditionally sought by longtime members: leadership of the house republican conference committee.
6. advances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases and modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to u.s. interests and security. in addition, the development and spread of such technologies remain uneven, increasing the potential to drastically widen the divide between so-called 'haves' and 'have-nots.'
-- in a divorce filing, sen. joni ernst (r-iowa) alleges that her husband mentally and emotionally abused her — and even once physically assaulted her. the des moines register's luke nozicka and linh ta report: 'we went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage,' ernst wrote [in her affidavit]. 'i very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.' joni ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. gail ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit. the next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. ernst declined, writing that she was 'embarrassed and humiliated' and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.
your mother's emotional manipulations have affected you so profoundly that you continue to basically put her (perceived) needs before your own. stop that.
i couldn't understand why my husband would keep that information from me all this time.
that's not to say they shouldn't try. as the world's fourth-most-populous nation, indonesia deserves a glorious unicorn wedding. but don't be surprised if the couple discovers that married life isn't always blissful.
former presidents bill clinton, george w. bush, and barack obama — who starred in an inauguration day video playing up the democratic transfer of power — will also soon be jointly urging wary americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the project. the sources requested anonymity to speak candidly.
when everyone is together again in an airplane hangar for the rose ceremony, peter gives his last rose to victoria, despite the fact that they've spent approximately 35 percent of their short relationship fighting.
ever since becoming a star, she's made small, artistically risky films that may not have had an upside where finances or fame or fan service were concerned but pushed the medium in exhilarating and sometimes strange, even alienating ways. for every conventional hollywood production such as cold mountain or the interpreter, she's made a chilly, brechtian experiment in actorly submission, such as lars von trier's dogville, or supported a still-emerging filmmaker, as in jonathan glazer's superb spiritual thriller birth.
in 2015, ya kaka, hauwa and their infants managed to escape the camps along with other captives. they walked for days to find villages with food and water. both babies died. many other women were freed after a months-long campaign by the nigerian military, but some were killed during the rescue operation. even those who escaped boko haram still suffered.

dear miss manners: what is the appropriate way to address a couple who are technically engaged but have no plans to marry?
-- the supreme court allowed trump's transgender troop ban to go into effect as it works its way through lower courts. robert barnes and dan lamothe report: the justices lifted nationwide injunctions that had kept the administration's policy from being implemented. the trump policy reverses an obama administration rule that would have opened the military to transgender men and women and instead bars those who identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and are seeking to transition. the court's five conservatives — chief justice john g. roberts jr. and justices clarence thomas, samuel a. alito jr., neil m. gorsuch and brett m. kavanaugh — allowed the restrictions to go into effect while the court decides whether eventually to consider the merits of the case. the liberal justices — ruth bader ginsburg, stephen g. breyer, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan — would have kept the injunctions in place.

recently the man who rejected her recognized her at an airport. sad told him he was mistaken, and that she wasn't the woman he thought she was.

one promising element is that you're even torn about it. you don't say so yourself, but your peace-guilt-worry pretzel does. your asking this question does.
but wait. this is where peter weber's season departs from the routine. one of them, he never makes it past the front door of her family's home. and he yet still keeps her around.
bell has a novelist's gimlet eye for details, and the stone archive offered him rich material. it revealed as much about the state of publishing in the 21st century as it did about stone. by any objective standard, stone was a successful author whose novels were critically acclaimed and received geometrically increasing advances. paid $1,500 for his first novel, stone finished his career with a million-dollar multi-book contract. as bell reminisced in the new yorker, stone's life could be read as a fulfillment of the american dream of which his work was so critical.
alan: we're mature people who are, i guess, out in the singles dating world, so we agreed, based upon our situation, that we don't need to beat around the bush.
i met my white grandmother for the first time at 17, in 2004, 13 years before she died, in the townhouse my father bought. my mom had given her grudging approval. i hugged her that day out of a sense of obligation. she was a small, blonde woman, hunched over and shuffling in a threadbare navy-blue robe. makeup covered the blemishes and liver spots on her face, though not the ones on her neck and chest. she was 83. antonia stared at me with blue eyes, smiled and touched my cheeks with wonder. i had been a grinning picture on the wall for 17 years, and now i was sitting in her living room.
a bill by rep. stephanie murphy (d-fla.) would bar qanon followers from receiving security clearances. following a report that at least 22 current or former members of the military or law enforcement were found to have been at or near the capitol riots, murphy, a former pentagon official, drew up the bill. if any americans participated in the capitol attack, or if they subscribe to these dangerous anti-government views of qanon, then they have no business being entrusted with our nation's secrets, she said.

well, suddenly my friend says he has to meet with a group every morning, including weekends. he is mysterious about the group, saying that he is not permitted to talk about what they do.
-- washington will start to see rain tonight that will last into tomorrow. the capital weather gang forecasts: high pressure centered offshore and our next system approaching from the west combine for a slightly milder flow from the south. after a significantly less frigid start in the 20s to near 30, temperatures rise into the upper 30s to mid-40s this afternoon under partly to mostly cloudy skies, with winds from the south around 10 mph. can't rule out a spotty afternoon shower or two, but most of the rain looks to hold off until late tonight.
later today, the vice president plans to hold a virtual meeting with national economic council director brian deese and small-business owners.
dad, a white man, knew the power of grievance politics, what he believed to be a sustaining element of trumpism, better than most. it didn't come just from his fascination with the civil war; my own family fractured over one woman's prejudice even before i was born. his mother's rejection of his marriage to a black woman, my mother, and the fallout that ensued, didn't define him. his work ethic and kindness did that. but it shaped his understanding of the origins of bigotry and the power of forgiveness.
the worst, most ridiculous bride in the world deserves to have a maid of honor who believes in what she is doing — or is at least willing to put her blinders on and go along with it.
the commandant of the coast guard lambasted the ongoing shutdown and its impact on service members:

next, two prominent officials in the arizona gop, reps. andy biggs and paul gosar, became ringleaders of a plot to overturn the election results. they have been identified as architects of last week's protest that turned into a deadly invasion of the u.s. capitol.
on wednesday, the committee passed the bill on an 8-to-6 vote, with two republicans among the yeas: the panel's chair, sen. jill holtzman vogel (fauquier); and sen. william r. desteph jr. (virginia beach).
president trump said he would be proud to shut down the government. now the longest government shutdown in history is jeopardizing some of his top priorities. (jm rieger/the washington post)
but ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-trump extremists. (ward famously suggested in 2018 that the mccain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.
i have a job, but that job pays me only when i am needed (which is rare). i have my own home and own my own vehicle, etc.
while the general assumption is that younger americans are more liberal, and therefore less likely to support trump, we noted earlier this year that young white men are the only members of the millennial generation — generally but informally defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 — who lean more republican than democrat. millennial men and millennial women tend to identify as democrats more heavily, as do millennial whites and nonwhites.
but northam's spending plan seemed aimed at his democratic base and will not pass muster with republicans looking to cut taxes, norment said. as chairman of the senate finance committee, norment said he is committed to working with the governor and democrats to overcome this impasse.
my husband and i have traveled the long, hard road back from infidelity. although very painful, this path was also achingly tender and deeply humbling. did i mention long?
the justice department inspector general is examining the abrupt departure earlier this month of u.s. attorney byung j. pak, who departed after trump complained that georgia officials weren't doing enough to find election fraud, matt zapotosky reports. doj inspector general michael horowitz's investigation appears to be in its early stages.
though the nigerian government declared victory over boko haram, the group regularly stages attacks around the country. many schools — common targets of boko haram — are still not secure. there are no soldiers or police at any school, ya kaka says. just last month, 110 schoolgirls were kidnapped from dapchi, nigeria. and the women who have been freed from boko haram need help and counseling. to ya kaka, though, those challenges are opportunities. i want to help my society, she says.
be respectful of others. in this case, it means not using masculine or feminine pronouns for those who object.

correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified alan oakes as a government it manager and veronica branch as a government procurement expert. oakes is a government procurement expert and branch is a government it manager. this story has been updated.
sometimes we'll just have to pause it, and say, 'i've had a really rough day,'  lohman said.
resolved, that the aft commits to continuing our unprecedented level of engagement to ensure nobody is on the sidelines in the november elections and that we do everything in our power to help biden win the democratic nomination and then elect him president.
this matters because what you provide is what somebody wants, needs, finds exciting. someone else. maybe you haven't met her yet, and i won't give you empty assurances that you will, but it's a no-brainer that there are women more in love with an introverted, respectful, fun, he'd-make-a-good-father style.

cox included a nod to del. ­eileen filler-corn (d-fairfax), whom democrats chose as the first female caucus leader in our history, he said, to raucous applause.
esther turned to her husband: we keep saying we will all see each other again soon. but we don't know if that's going to happen.
five years after antonia defaced the photos, she asked to come back into my dad's life. she was no longer collecting an income and was in danger of losing her home. dad saved the house. still, she declined to apologize for her actions, and when he brought up the destroyed photos in later years, lamenting that he had no record of his childhood, she pretended not to know what he was talking about. she told him she pitied my brothers and me for being black but didn't blame us. for the rest of her life, alex visited her on sundays, a secret he kept from me until i was a teenager. he didn't bother trying to reconcile his mother and brother and his wife, who tolerated his loyalty to blood. (my mom could have easily poisoned us against our grandmother and prevented us from ever seeing her, but i believe she wanted us to see for ourselves who and what antonia was.)
i'm in my mid-40s; too old for this! sometimes it feels like i'm keeping a secret that has power over me, and if i could just share the secret with him it would diffuse the power. but i realize that would endanger my job and my reputation, so i immediately put that thought out of my mind.
i have no desire to celebrate him in any way, much less be forced to go to his wedding.
you should ask your husband what other minor details he neglected to share with you, pre-marriage. does he have children you don't know about? was he in the military, the seminary, a boy band?
but shortly after page six's report lit up social media, tmz weighed in with its own exclusive: not so fast! kim kardashian and kanye west have been in marriage counseling, and we've learned the subject of divorce was looming for much of 2020, but they haven't given up, the site explained under the headline kim and kanye in marriage counseling … divorce on the table. the article also noted that west has been living at his ranch in wyoming and kardashian is staying in california with their four children. we're told no final decision has been made.
and of course you're hurt. you thought she married you for love, and you just found out she hired you for a job.
methodist church trials over same-sex marriage have been controversial since 2013, when a pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after officiating at his son's marriage to another man. other pastors have gone through mediation with their accusers after performing a same-sex ceremony.
one need only consider kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's lion, alight quickly on moulin rouge! and the others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in dead calm and days of thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the meryl streeps, viola davises and cate blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.
3. no longer a solely u.s. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the united states. adversaries are increasing their presence in this domain with plans to reach or exceed parity in some areas. for example, russia and china will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce u.s. military effectiveness and overall security. increasing commercialization of space now provides capabilities that were once limited to global powers to anyone that can afford to buy them. many aspects of modern society—to include our ability to conduct military operations—rely on our access to and equipment in space.
the constant togetherness of the new life within four walls can feel like confinement , or a second honeymoon — or both, in the same afternoon. the extended home stay is a novel experience for most people, and they are casting about for comparisons, for something to make this seem a touch more normal.
-- buzzfeed obtained documents outlining detailed plans for trump tower moscow, contradicting comments from trump and his allies that the proposal fizzled in its earliest stages. buzzfeed news's azeen ghorayshi reports: the plan was dazzling: a glass skyscraper that would stretch higher than any other building in europe, offering ultra-luxury residences and hotel rooms and bearing a famous name. trump tower moscow, conceived as a partnership between [trump's] company and a russian real estate developer, looked likely to yield profits in excess of $300 million. … on monday, trump's lawyer, rudy giuliani, said 'the proposal was in the earliest stage,' and he went on to tell the new yorker that 'no plans were ever made. there were no drafts. nothing in the file.' however, hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans, obtained by buzzfeed news over a year of reporting, tell a very different story. trump tower moscow was a richly imagined vision of upscale splendor on the banks of the moscow river. …
to lift her spirits in the evening, she has started dressing for dinner. she puts on the earrings she once bought in mexico but never got around to wearing. then the finishing touch: a flower in her hair.
how do i broach that subject with them — i know his mom doesn't like me, but i'd appreciate the support.
-- despots — and would-be despots — have seen in trump a model, as well as an alibi, griff witte, carol morello, shibani mahtani and anthony faiola report in today's newspaper. the strongman style of leadership is not new, of course, and it is not always obvious who is inspiring whom. but in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional american values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.
yet, as you yourself describe your decision, it will take either his mother or his father out of your son's day-to-day life, because i deserve to chase my own dreams.
greitens has received mixed reviews in as governor. while campaigning on a platform of cleaning up government, he admitted to the missouri ethics commission that he had violated campaign finance law, according to the kansas city star. he was fined $1,000. he and his senior staff have also come under fire for using an app that deletes text messages after they've been read, raising concerns about trying to subvert missouri open records law.
the chances your child will have another crack at childhood: zero.
actually, that's always the question, but it can be helpful to walk ourselves up to it.
veronica branch, 56, a government it manager, describes her dream date as an educated man who has traveled some, has his own means and wants a companion who is his equal. alan oakes, 59, a government procurement expert, is looking for someone who laughs easily and is intelligent but not too engrossed in their work. the pair agreed on everything necessary to make a great long-term relationship, and that this thing called sparks is for crazy youngsters. or is it? if not sparks, then what would it take for them to make a romantic connection? we sent them to ophelia's fish house on barracks row to find out.
among those supporting the effort to challenge the results was minority leader kevin mccarthy (calif.), a potential rival to cheney for the speakership if republicans regain the house in two years. mccarthy spokesman matt sparks said republicans welcome differing views and said the leadership team is united.
he claimed to have been contacted by law enforcement authorities as well as members of the media.
-- hundreds of irs workers have gotten permission to skip work because of financial hardship, just as the tax season gets busy. danielle paquette, lisa rein, jeff stein and kimberly kindy report: the trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000 irs workers back to their offices, where they have been working to process refunds without pay. … but irs employees across the country — some in coordinated protest, others out of financial necessity — won't be clocking in, according to tony reardon, president of the national treasury employees union, and several local union officials. the work action is widespread and includes employees from a processing center in ogden, utah, to the brookhaven campus on new york's long island.
offered to help? pah. the gifts were for both of you, so you both say thank you and you don't position yourself to be the social load-bearing entity in your marriage because that idea is so tired and tiring.
dr. glazer worked in the john f. kennedy administration, in what is now the department of housing and urban development, and was a consultant to johnson's model cities program. but he drew on social science research to conclude that programs designed to alleviate poverty — including head start, the job corps and meals on wheels — were counterproductive.
what do we do in this case, and when this inevitably comes up again?
-- the shutdown has forced trump to sideline the rest of his agenda. the new york times's peter baker reports: the standoff has already forced mr. trump to cancel a trip to europe to meet with global business leaders in davos, switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. the president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. he has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.
now, the models are gone, replaced by a new, more intimate, opportunity — his wife of 56 years, carlene. in his student days, she was an early muse and occasional model. a quick painting he did of her in a colleague's illustration class remains among his best works.
i am conflicted about the how/when/where.
on what was supposed to be a banner evening for greitens, he then was forced to issue the statement with his wife confirming the affair. his wife also issued her own statement:
but created equal isn't that kind of documentary. rather, it's meant as an opportunity for thomas to have his full say, without challenge. at one point, he talks about how he prefers to vacation in rv parks instead of, say, resorts. he explains that he prefers the company of what he calls regular people, leading one to wonder, among many other questions left unasked and unanswered: does that mean that travelers who stay in hotels are, despite the film's title, less regular than others?
but northam's vision of a rapidly rising state flush with cash to build on its success is based on a fundamental disagreement with republicans, who still control both houses of the legislature. the governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts president trump signed last year.
now priefer has been tasked with leading the browns to a victory on the road in their first postseason appearance in 18 years. the team hasn't won a playoff game since 1995, when then-head coach bill belichick defeated bill parcells and the new england patriots.
the earliest tide in my father's life was his mother, antonia, and it carried dark currents. during world war ii she made her way from ukraine to berlin as a refugee, and when the war ended, she worked in a military hospital operated by the allies. there she met an officer from the american midwest and conceived my father, who was born in heidelberg after his father shipped home. five years later, my grandfather sponsored her and their son's emigration to the united states on the condition that they never contact him. she settled in virginia, married, had another son, divorced and kept dating. antonia was prone to fits of anger and verbal abuse. in one episode my dad recalls, she took the large tin can of his collected marbles and dumped them in a sewer drain in front of him when he was 12.
the memories bounce around in her head. sometimes, she and noel talk about the situation. but after four decades of marriage, they've found their equilibrium. when they get on each other's nerves, they just stop talking.
back in 2013, okcupid tried something like this: an app called crazy blind date, where profile photos were displayed as a scrambled image. users would input the times they had available to meet up and preferred locations. the app would then either set people up blindly or allow them to schedule with another user based on the times and locations they had on offer. it sounds like a brilliant way to do an end-run around endless predate conversing, but okcupid got a lot of backlash over the app. why? well, one of the reasons people often don't want to go on dates immediately with strangers from the internet is that they want to make sure they'll be safe — and often picking a public place isn't enough to ensure that. however, in the serene yet sanitized world frank and amy find themselves in, the danger seems to come not from their dates but from the security officers stalking about with stun guns.
rebecca kelly slaughter was named acting chairwoman of the federal trade commission, while jessica rosenworcel was named acting chairwoman of the federal communications commission. both may face early obstacles as vacancies at the ftc and fcc may leave them deadlocked, but will likely set back some of their most ambitious plans until biden nominates additional democrats. biden must decide whether to name rosenworcel and slaughter as permanent chairs, was named acting chairwoman of the federal trade commission, whilewas named acting chairwoman of the federal communications commission. both may face early obstacles as vacancies at the ftc and fcc may leave them deadlocked, but will likely set back some of their most ambitious plans until biden nominates additional democrats. biden must decide whether to name rosenworcel and slaughter as permanent chairs, tony romm reports

you can have widely varying attitudes on money or faith or nutrition or whatever else, but it's hard to get by contentedly unless you're able to talk to each other when you're bothered by something.
9. continued federal budget uncertainty strains the [intelligence community's] ability to make deliberative and responsive resource decisions. the outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues. the [intelligence community] needs to develop methods to efficiently shift resources to mitigate programmatic (fiscal) risk and avoid loss of vital programs, capabilities, and resource investments.
greitens (r), responding to media reports, acknowledged wednesday night that he was unfaithful to his wife a few years ago before being elected. but his lawyer denied the blackmail allegation.
if you hate-watch this show as much as we do, you know that there is a moment in every season of this garbage show that can break a person. that moment arrived on peter and victoria's date. pete is the worst. victoria is the worst. this season is the worst! this show is the worst. we are all the worst, for watching and enjoying it.
shedding light on this secret might be the best thing for you, and i could well imagine that your mother would want to know (most loyal mothers would).
if people want to live together, it's no skin off my nose, but what makes me crazy are the people who say we're planning on getting married. unless you've picked a date and started making arrangements, you are not.
i'm going to assume that your daughter might be older — and that you are not encountering this coach regularly, and so there is no personal overlap between the three of you. this might account for how this news took so long to get to you.
-- a group representing fbi agents issued a report saying the shutdown is affecting investigations on child trafficking, terrorism and more. the new york times's katie benner reports: because of the shutdown, the f.b.i. has been unable to issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases cited in the report. an agent working on an ms-13 investigation that has gone on for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can communicate with his spanish-speaking informants, the report said. the bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics, gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. the f.b.i. could lose those informants.

alan: she was a charming, attractive lady. there wasn't a love connection, that's for sure, however, and i say that because the type of lady i'm attracted to is someone who is fairly active.
the measure died on a tied 7-to-7 vote, with vogel the only republican voting for it.
perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. but this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.

the text then says republicans will officially censure her at their jan. 23, 2020 mandatory meeting. (i'm still writing 2020 on my censure resolutions, too.)
but if you want to be a parent, then do what countless others have done who, like you, have relocated for better opportunities — or who emigrated, or outlived their families, or cut ties after years of dysfunction. you discard preconceptions and develop a network of friends, paid caregivers, drop-in centers, schools and whatever else you need. you study your employers' leave policies. and you trust the resourcefulness that made you a specialized, big-city asset to serve you here, or in whatever challenge you take on next.
the extramarital relationship itself, however, may have been the least explosive part of the story.
on monday night, in a conference call with republicans, mccarthy said he opposed impeachment, while cheney declined to reveal her view, other than to say, this is going to be a vote of conscience.
you know what i think would be awesome? if i could adopt a kid from every continent. i think that would be a pretty cool goal, he said. i want to sit around the dinner table every night and see kids from africa, asia, europe, south america, right here in the states. how cool would that be? it's one of my favorite things to dream about.
you know, noel replied, i've already thought of that.
every night, before going to sleep, my last prayer has always been: 'thanks for all my kids being safe,'  he said. and now, it's also: 'man, are we really?'
and when members of the u.n. security council visited myanmar 's commander in chief in late april to demand explanations for the expulsion of more than 700,000 rohingya muslims, he used the phrase 'fake news' — the only words he spoke in english — no less than a dozen times.

allie was supposed to spend her 21st birthday with friends on the greek island of santorini, and her father was going to make a surprise appearance.
speaking at the white house in july 2019, trump said, scooter libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and liz was right in the forefront of that one and i said, 'what do you think, liz,' and you said, 'absolutely, he deserves it,' and it's been a very popular pardon. at another event, trump said that liz cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. that was just an honor for me to do it. he called cheney a wonderful person, and somebody that has, i don't know, a pretty unlimited future.
it's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. in kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. with her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.
and, you're doing this just as he has one foot on the threshold into adolescence, one of the most dizzying, unnerving and impressionable times of our lives.
the second complaint was not what you would call friendly, miller said. neither she nor ensz would say who submitted the complaint, citing an ongoing process.
what do you want for lunch? she tries again, louder.
you might be a good candidate for fostering a child. becoming a foster parent would give you the opportunity to see if full-time parenting is something you can tackle. you will be interviewed and educated about what is required, and you would be supported through your efforts.
founded in 1965 by kristol and sociologist daniel bell, the public interest became a bastion of neoconservative thought, even as dr. glazer tried to preserve it as a space for rigorous public policy analysis while serving as co-editor from 1973 to 2002.
cheney, who was unanimously reelected to her leadership position in november, has a voting record that underscores her conservatism. she has high ratings from right-leaning organizations and zero percent ratings from groups such as the human rights campaign, which advocates for gay rights; the league of conservation voters; and the planned parenthood action fund, according to govtrack.
[when] i look at policies that are trying to improve welfare, he said in the 1997 documentary arguing the world, according to the magazine city journal, i think you must keep on trying even if you have not had great success.
at the same time, he said, the decision will prompt republicans who disagree with her decision to consider whether there should be political consequences for her internally.
but despite her poverty, she could still cling to one vanity: she was a white woman in a segregated world, a member of the protected class. in her mind, she was better than at least one group of americans, and so were her sons.
neither the governor or his wife said anything about the reported photo shoot or the alleged blackmail threat.

i want to adopt so badly, tebow said to people. i can't wait. it's definitely something i see in my future.
it's been a strange few weeks. stranger than after the 9/11 attacks, when the girls were little and the fear, though rattling, dissipated pretty quickly. now, by day at the wood house, everyone finds a place to work or study. then they come together after 5 p.m., taking a walk, working out, playing scrabble, watching movies. with three of his four daughters at home, wood has grown accustomed to watching chick flicks. i got to the point where 'this is us' really struck a nerve, he said.

that group became known as the neoconservatives, a term that originated as a pejorative under socialist political theorist michael harrington before being embraced by kristol and rejected by dr. glazer, who ultimately considered himself a centrist democrat, according to friends. he told the wall street journal last year that he voted republican only once, in massachusetts, to protest the fact that some kennedy was being elected from the district again and again.
but i have bronchitis and i realized i should start staying at home, he said. so it's just him, his work, and the couple's rescue dog, albie. other than walking the mix of maltese, shih tzu and poodle, he's left the house four times since march 2, mainly to pick up takeout food.
she and noel got in her jeep and went to see their city. they passed the shuttered businesses, the empty lot at don pedro's mexican restaurant. it was real peaceful and real quiet, she said. but it was shocking and sad. how many things are going to change.

there's nothing that says you have to have kids, of course. it might just not be for you.
in the case of the kardashians, it's more clear-cut than you might expect. the most reliable source of information for the kardashians is e!, which has been the home of their reality tv empire for 13 years. and when we say reliable, we don't mean necessarily 100 percent true — the network essentially operates as state media, and it's where the family can shape the story. so when you want to see the narrative framing that will probably show up on a future season of keeping up with the kardashians (coincidentally or not, the final season is scheduled to air early this year), you can check out e! and its online offshoots.
then, to her shock, she alleged, he snapped photographs of her naked and threatened to distribute the pictures if she revealed the relationship.
in 2016, cheney sought wyoming's lone u.s. house seat, which her father had once held. after winning the seat, cheney's ambition was to become one of the most powerful women on capitol hill.

the youngest of seven children, nathan glazer was born in manhattan on feb. 25, 1923. both parents were jewish immigrants from poland; his father was a sewing-machine operator, and his mother was a homemaker. a brother, joe glazer, became a protest singer known as labor's troubadour for his performances at picket lines and union rallies.
my father never explained to me how he had eluded his mother's thinking on race, and i never asked. it's a strange thing for a black son to ask his white father: why aren't you a racist? he met black men in the navy and while working as an office mover, and at some point simply decided that his mother was wrong about black people. he avoided the romance of the lost cause, relying instead on what he saw in the real world.
you should get used to the idea that your mother is going to be upset, regardless of what you choose to do.
john lomperis, a united methodist who advocates with the traditionalist protestant group institute on religion and democracy, said that the bishop and ensz might agree to a just resolution, which is like an out-of-court settlement.
5. increasing migration and urbanization of populations are further straining the capacities of governments around the world and are likely to result in further fracturing of societies, potentially creating breeding grounds for radicalization. pressure points include growing influxes of migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons fleeing conflict zones; areas of intense economic or other resource scarcity; and areas threatened by climate changes, infectious disease outbreaks, or transnational criminal organizations. all of these issues will continue to drive global change on an unprecedented scale.
the denomination uses an internal judicial system with judges and trials led by clergy. in 2019, the church adopted new penalties, effective jan. 1: the mandatory penalty for officiating a same-sex marriage would be a year's suspension without pay, and a second conviction would mean a pastor would be defrocked.
guatemala also voted with the united states on jerusalem and announced it would move its own embassy to the city. months later, in august, president jimmy morales declared he was abolishing the mandate of a u.n.-backed commission that had long been known as an effective watchdog in curbing corruption. as he spoke, a column of three dozen jeeps — some with roof-mounted machine guns — that had been supplied by the united states for anti-narcotics operations rolled through guatemala city, pausing at the commission's offices and the homes of human rights activists.
can mitch mcconnell stand against donald trump and still control the kentucky gop?  by the lexington herald leader's daniel desrochers:  tensions are high. the nelson county republican party voted to censure mcconnell over his statements on the senate floor tuesday, passing a resolution that called on mcconnell to retract his comments. don thrasher, the nelson county republican party chairman, said he felt that mcconnell impugned the integrity of trump on the senate floor. by the lexington herald leader's daniel desrochers:

-- pelosi remains adamant that democrats will not vote to fund the wall, but several more moderate members want to compromise. politico's burgess everett and rachael bade report: a group of centrist house democrats, sick of political posturing, is pressing [pelosi] to counter trump's immigration proposal with her own potential compromise. the group, led by freshman rep. elaine luria of virginia, is asking the california democrat to offer trump a vote on his border wall or some sort of negotiated security package in february if he first signs a bill reopening the federal government … 'give trump the money,' rep. collin peterson, a centrist democrat from a red minnesota district, told a local radio station tuesday. 'i'd give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. why are we fighting over this? we're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.'
when that advancement never came to pass, his views began to shift, perhaps most notably in the field of affirmative action. while his 1975 book affirmative discrimination argued that public policy must be exercised without distinction of race, color or national origin, he later championed a pragmatic approach to higher education admissions, one that employed a racial preference.
this is a completely understandable impulse. i've had it myself, which is why after my long-ago divorce i dated everyone i ever knew in college.
-- sen. mark warner (d-va.) introduced a bill called the stop stupidity act to prevent future shutdowns. from felicia sonmez: the measure would automatically keep all of the federal government running in the case of a future funding standoff — with the exceptions of the legislative branch and the executive office of the president. 'the stop stupidity act takes the aggressive but necessary step of forcing the president and congress to do the jobs they were elected to do,' warner said in a statement. ... the full name of warner's measure is the 'stop shutdowns transferring unnecessary pain and inflicting damage in the coming years act.'

you can't make him agree to this, of course. you can, however, stick to your own limit by not agreeing to gruesome car trips, even flying solo against his wishes if you must. while it isn't ideal, it's a valid response to accusations of abandoning him, which are controlling and highly manipulative.

priefer, who was born in cleveland, noted at that news conference that he grew up in northeast ohio. he went on to attend the u.s. naval academy, where he began his coaching career after serving as an officer for six years, including tours of duty in the persian gulf and in the mediterranean sea. according to his team bio, he also earned a master's degree from the university of maryland.
i don't have to wonder what my dad would've said about the men who brought the confederate flag into the capitol, and violence with it, in a failed effort to overturn the results of a democratic election. he would want them and those who inspired and organized the riot to be held responsible, just as my grandmother lost precious years with her grandchildren. he would want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. and ultimately, he would want these men and women in the grips of a dark tide — his siblings in this american experiment — to be forgiven.
when the nigerian army opened fire on rock-throwing demonstrators last fall, killing as many as 40 people, it defended itself by citing trump's threats to do the same at the mexican border.

people and us weekly — also known to have symbiotic relationships with the family — ran their own versions of the story that echoed the same details: kardashian and west are living apart, nothing is official, a split appears inevitable. then, in one mildly unexpected place, the today show also published a confirmation of their separation, noting that the couple is in marriage counseling, crediting a source close to the family.
you quite obviously don't like this bride. you don't like the way she is behaving and you don't intend to honor your maid of honor duties.
these kids on the mall, though, aren't millennials. they're members of a younger generation that doesn't have a broadly accepted name. the previous administration dubbed them the homeland generation, but a recent survey from pew research center labeled them generation z — presumably following generation x and generation y, an early name for millennials. (the groups are defined here.)
naturally, the possible breakup of one of our culture's highest-profile couples caused shock waves through the celebrity press — although the tabloids have been on high alert since the summer, when west kicked off his campaign for president with a controversial speech that left kardashian reportedly furious after he told the crowd they considered terminating her pregnancy when she was expecting their first child. in now-deleted tweets, west claimed kardashian was trying to get a doctor to lock [him] up and said he had wanted to divorce her for months.

pew's research on the generation established a lot of comfort among members of the generation on lgbtq issues. the oldest whites who spoke to pew saw same-sex marriage as a bad thing; the youngest, including young white males, disagreed.

it gives couples certainty about how long they'll be together. call me a cynic, but when frank and amy hit their system buttons on their first date and found out their relationship would last a grand total of 12 hours, i was incredibly relieved for them. they both seemed disappointed. but all i could think was: wow, that makes it easy! no anxious thoughts about whether and when the person you're with might break up with you; no energy spent on the uncertainty of dating. everything is decided for you. what a relief!
ah, but you and i know that you probably cannot do this.

somewhat controversially, dr. glazer also argued that prejudice and racism alone could not explain the concentration of problems in the negro community. values and behavior also played a significant role, in his view, although he believed that civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s would effectively enable african americans to rise up the social and economic ladder.

-- the bigger picture: democrats note that trump is following an established pattern of attempting to force his opponents to capitulate by offering to resolve a disaster of his own making. damian paletta and josh dawsey report: trump has described this approach as creating leverage and negotiating, but democrats and other opponents have said it amounts to 'hostage taking.' 'it's sort of like bartering with stolen goods,' [schumer] said tuesday. trump has used the same playbook during confrontations with canada, mexico, japan, china, south korea, north korea and the european union in the past two years with mixed success. … it is a well-worn tactic from trump's business career, but this is the first time the livelihoods of so many u.s. workers and households have hung in the balance as a result of it.
sens. glen h. sturtevant jr.

senate minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) argues a trial shouldn't begin until mid-february to give trump time to mount a defense. trump has apparently secured an attorney for the trial: butch bowers, a columbia, s.c., lawyer known for his prominent role in litigating political and election matters for north and south carolina republicans.
at first hang the dj's premise appears to be a more cheerful version of the lobster, a dark comedy about a hotel where singles are sent to meet their match, or else. after 45 days, those who don't find a suitable mate get turned into the animal of their choosing. it took the idea of dying alone to frightening heights.
well, obviously this is all happening really fast for dad, says dad when he learns that peter has told madison that he is falling in love with her. she's so pure, he adds, which is a totally normal thing for a dad to say about his adult daughter, probably. i just don't want you to break her heart.
her father, meanwhile, is concerned with a different list — the many other women still in the running. there is other young ladies involved, he tells peter, skepticism apparently overwhelming his capacity for ordinary grammatical speech. attempting to reassure this nonplussed patriarch, peter suggests that he plans to tell hannah ann this very night that he is falling in love with her. i wasn't expecting that, the concerned parent replies. i'd rather you not say that to her unless you mean it.

the other flourish was the reimagining of the traditional wreath-laying at arlington national cemetery, usually a more low-key affair, to compensate for the absence of the parade that usually stretches from the capitol to the white house after the president's swearing-in. the 2021 version, rather than just featuring the outgoing president and vice president, included biden, vice president harris, bill and hillary clinton, george w. and laura bush, and barack and michelle obama.

but he never escaped the damage he suffered during his dickensian childhood. raised by an unmarried schizophrenic mother in a series of squalid hotel rooms, stone was never told anything more about his father than his mother's unreliable report that the man was a greek, a jew, or a lebanese. (a dna test contained no information to support his mother's claims.) when his mother became unfit to care for him, stone was consigned for four years to a catholic orphanage where the faith was literally pounded into him. by the time mother and son were reunited, stone was essentially a street child, and by his early teens, a drunk and a drug user. a stint in the u.s. navy introduced him to a life more abundant, although it also reinforced his appetite for intoxicants and women.

for some reason i can't walk away from you, she says.but you kind of do, he says. she ends it by telling him that she's falling in love with him, and giving him the old-timey photo.

senate leaders are struggling to build conservative support for their emerging bill, with gop aides and senators voicing growing skepticism that hard-right sens. rand paul (r-ky.) and mike lee (r-utah) can be persuaded to back it. conservative organizations, meanwhile, are complaining that majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is offering proposals that would not sufficiently dismantle the law known as obamacare.
but because choice was heavily criticized as being too unwieldy and bureaucratic, congress tried to reform it by passing the mission act in 2018 under trump. the mission act loosens the restrictions around when a vet may seek private medical care, allowing it if they live more than 30 minutes from a va clinic or face wait times of more than 20 days for most health-care appointments.

question: tpp was dead on arrival (inaudible), so why this executive order anything more than symbolic? and when will president trump start negotiating those bilateral deals with the 11 other countries in the asia-pacific? could take some time and that could be, some would say, giving china, you know, room to make an inroad.

news you can use if you live in d.c.:
a 1998 investigation by the u.s. department of health and human services found that 30 percent of children under 6 years old in the community had elevated lead levels, which can damage the developing brain. but people continued to live in the apartment complex until it was deemed uninhabitable in 2016.
then, yesterday, house republicans passed a bill that would prevent the district of columbia from using local tax dollars to subsidize abortion services for low-income women. jenna portnoy and aaron c. davis report: although the senate has never passed the bill, the vote was an ominous sign that the district could become an afterthought as congress considers targeting laws regulating guns, assisted suicide and marijuana in the nation's capital. the stakes are particularly high for the district this year, as it can no longer rely on a democratic presidential veto.
during the presidential campaign, trump said repeatedly that he could not release his returns because he is undergoing an audit and that he would do so once that process is complete. the audit has always been a flimsy excuse. nothing is stopping him from releasing the returns any way, and he could release previous years not under audit.
manchin would also be more enthused if lawmakers would dedicate a permanent funding stream to opioid abuse, as he's proposed in a bill dubbed the lifeboat act, which would extract fees from the makers of prescription opioids to pay for substance-abuse treatment.
health care was a central issue in the 2018 midterms, with democrats often focusing on the issue in campaign ads. those ads leveraged republican hostility to the affordable care act and a lawsuit targeting the law to raise the specter of a decline in coverage and a loss of coverage for preexisting conditions — to good political effect for the party.
discussions are ongoing about just how far to go on some policies, in particular the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which has temporarily shielded hundreds of thousands of people who arrived in the u.s. as children from deportation. trump has previously vowed to reverse it.
the media throng streams into the small store. (it's like a clown car, said one woman.) the distractions kept coming: a chime kept ringing out when someone opened the door — an interruption cruz called fun, kind of like being on a game show. when a cell phone rang with the theme to a clint eastwood western, cruz did an impression of the actor.
actuaries for covered california, the state's aca marketplace, estimated that patients hospitalized because of coronavirus would stay an average of 12 days, generating an average bill of $72,000.
white house allies professed confusion over the president's tactics, they report. for republicans who have tried to stick with the mercurial president, the shifting goal posts have been frustrating. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has said he will not allow a vote on any bill to reopen the government unless he receives assurances from the white house that trump supports it. 'it's always difficult,' said sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), when the person you're negotiating with is someone who changes their mind.'
4. how will trump try to bring jobs back from overseas?
democrats have two tasks. first, avoid picking an obvious target for trump to shred, either someone far to the left or someone who seems shaky, uncertain, equivocating or weak. he's got his socialist tag ready for the first category. with regard to the second concern — gravitas, strength, leadership abilities — democrats should consider how their nominee will stand up to trump. does he or she have the focus, humor and self-discipline to avoid being dragged down to his level, and does the nominee know where he or she wants to take the country. trump's simplistic nostalgia is wrong and misguided, but it is comprehensible. to project strength, the democrat is going to have to be able to punch through the trumpian noise and make the case that voters are at risk if trump gets reelected.
finally, the time has come to give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines — creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.
* there's no mandate for the gop agenda: nate silver looks at the health-care debacle and concludes that not only was the gop plan unpopular; but it's also clear that neither trump nor congressional republicans have any mandate:

trump ignores the fact that hundreds of va employees every month already were being fired before the law was passed; in fact, he falsely suggests that firings were not possible before, even if employees 'stole or were sadists,'  glenn writes.

the interior department reactivated its official twitter accounts after an abrupt shutdown that followed the national park service account retweeting two items viewed as unsympathetic to the new president. one referred to the size of the inauguration crowd on the mall, while another addressed policies that were excised from the white house website after trump's swearing in.

after her aca insurer left the state, she couldn't afford the only plan that remained, danaher said. there is no reason a healthy 32-year-old should be paying more for health insurance than for her mortgage.
-- rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii), another potential 2020 candidate, accused fellow democrats of religious bigotry in their questioning of a trump judicial nominee. felicia sonmez reports: she argued that some lawmakers had gone too far in their questioning of brian buescher, whom trump nominated in october to serve as a district judge. 'while i oppose the nomination of brian buescher to the u.s. district court in nebraska, i stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers buescher's catholicism and his affiliation with the knights of columbus,' gabbard said in the op-ed.
so it's an issue that's gonna -- he's gonna continue to work on. he understands as we reform health care, as we repeal and replace obamacare, that getting a hold of the cost of prescription drugs, to give more people access to them, but also to allow greater access in health care -- greater plans in health care, that's going to be key part of it.
— meanwhile, the world health organization announced it would convene an emergency meeting to decide whether to declare the virus a global health emergency. the news came as china reported confirmed cases in beijing and in guangdong province, 14 cases in health care workers — a first — and a confirmed incident involving human-to-human spread of the new virus, known provisionally as 2019-ncov, stat's helen branswell writes.
an energy reporter for the la times imagined this scenario:

but cruz, after building a national brand stoking tensions with mcconnell and his top deputies, is, in his own words, trying to get to yes. the former presidential hopeful has spoken positively about the negotiations, which he helped kick-start. his investment in the talks has generated cautious optimism among many republicans that he won't walk away from a delicate effort from which mcconnell, with a 52-seat majority and vice president pence as a potential tiebreaking vote, can afford only two defections.

spicer: infrastructure, of course, yes. that's definitely -- and he's continued to bring that up. he talked with the business executives today about how so many of our airports, that are so important to our commerce system, getting planes to land in and out, roads and their ability to truck things across the country, even our freight system. that if our infrastructure is not strong, it inhibits our ability to have free commerce, it inhibits -- it drives up the cost of goods and services, when someone's got to take a different route. or is limited in the opportunities that they have because their runway might be closed or it can't be expanded or a rail line breaks down. or highways just not -- the wear and tear it puts on trucks or shut down. so infrastructure continues to be huge priority for him. yes sir?
and we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
trump will announce his supreme court nominee next thursday:
the republicans are all but certain to nominate as their candidate the incumbent, trump, who is deeply unpopular nationally and loathed by democratic voters. just as trump benefited from antipathy by some toward hillary clinton in 2016, trump's eventual opponent will certainly benefit from trump's unpopularity. what's more, trump will probably again dominate much of the news coverage before the election — but this time, much will be focused on his administration, which is unlikely to appeal to many democrats or independents.

-- trump is planning to sign executive orders enabling the construction of the mexican border wall and targeting sanctuary cities. jerry markon, robert costa and abigail hauslohner report: the actions, part of a multi-day focus on immigration, are among an array of sweeping and immediate changes to the nation's immigration system under consideration by the new president. the moves represent trump's first effort to deliver on perhaps the signature issue that drove his presidential campaign: his belief that illegal immigration is out of control and threatening the country's safety and security. trump's immigration blitz this week is widely seen inside the white house as a victory for the self-described populist wing of his inner circle — which includes chief strategist [steve] bannon, attorney general nominee jeff sessions and top policy adviser stephen miller.

the only significant change to the law that's been made during trump's presidency is a repeal of the mandate that people have coverage. it is now the case that a fifth of those younger than 25 and more than a quarter of those who make less than $25,000 a year don't.
as a matter of simple math, mulvaney is wrong. far more people — twice as many — gained under the affordable care act than paid a penalty. we're not sure why mulvaney would have such a limited understanding of the impact of the law, but it may have started with his misimpression that tens of millions of people were paying a fine. that's totally off base, too.
as americans, we cannot allow this to continue, trump said in an oct. 26, 2017, white house speech. it is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. never been this way. we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.
the company will sell new versions of its humalog junior kwikpen and humalog mix75/25. the medicine will cost $265.20 for a pack of five kwikpens and will be available by mid-april, reuters's manas mishra and michael erman report.

it's true the aca marketplaces had a rough website rollout in 2013 and struggled in subsequent years to attract enough insurers to offer affordable coverage. but things have been looking better lately. the congressional budget office has said the individual market would be largely stable for the next 10 years, mostly because a majority of the enrollees are eligible for subsidies and are thereby sheltered from premium hikes.

question: so i have a follow-up on the housekeeping question about nafta. are we not to expect, then, an executive order today to renegotiate nafta or will he wait until he meets with president pena nieto next week? and on the other -- the other question i had is, he didn't mention latin america at all in his -- you know, in his inauguration speech. does he plan to visit latin america this year?
that's what he's fighting for is that man or woman out there that's doing everything they can right but can't catch a break. and i think he addressed that in his inaugural speech when he talked about shifting power outside of washington d.c. back to the american people because for too long it's been about stats more (ph) and it's been about, what number are we looking at as opposed to what face are we looking at?
the judge refused to permanently block new rules for assigning livers that the federal government approved in december 2018.
meanwhile, idaho is attempting a different route around the aca rules. gov. c.l. butch otter in january issued an executive order to allow insurers to sell health plans missing some of the federal requirements as long as the companies also sell at least one plan inside idaho's aca marketplace. the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) recently told idaho officials that the approach appears likely to be illegal, but it has been holding meetings and conference calls to try to work out a solution.
-- senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley (r-iowa) said he's looking into whether he could obtain trump's tax returns. from bloomberg news's laura davison and kaustuv basu: grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. … still, the iowa republican cautioned that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask treasury to release the documents. 'don't interpret this as looking into it, but i'm going to have a briefing by joint tax on what all of this involves before i answer any questions,' grassley told reporters on wednesday, referring to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation.

last friday, the trump team deleted any reference to global warming on the white house web site. now they're going much further. the white house has ordered the epa to remove the climate change page from its own website, which contains links to scientific global warming research and detailed data on emissions, reuters reports. the page could go dark as early as today. if the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear, one epa staffer said, adding that some employees were scrambling overnight to download the information on personal devices so it cannot be deleted.
both senators returned to work quickly, but their brief absence served as a stark reminder of just how perilous the democratic majority is in a 50-50 senate, particularly as they plan to push through a $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package later this week, paul writes. if one democrat has a fever, breaks an ankle or takes a bad fall, the legislative process would come to a stop until all 50 were able to vote for president biden's first critical legislative agenda item.
i think a big challenge is people don't really have a concept of how little medicare offers, said matt salo, executive director of the national association of medicaid directors. medicare has made a huge difference in the lives of many people over the years, but it falls short in a lot of areas.
a presidential historian tweeted a famous trump quote after he walked out of his meeting with democratic leadership:
bush deployed powell to spend some of the capital that he'd earned as president, including through his navigation of the aftermath of 9/11. bush gave his own oval office address a month after powell's u.n. appearance hoping to convey the seriousness and deliberateness of his decision to invade iraq. it was an attempt, in part, to use the white house as a character witness to his argument.
according to data provided by the department of justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. we have seen the attacks at home — from boston to san bernardino to the pentagon and yes, even the world trade center.
and our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
much of that was driven by strong opposition from republicans. slightly more than half of independents viewed the idea positively — but that's much lower than the three-quarters who backed the other proposals included by kff. support among democrats for medicare-for-all wasn't particularly strong, generally matching support for the other proposals.
so it's really about leadership. it's about character. and it's about results and accountability. i will be accountable. and i -- if i run for president, i promise you, i will fix the v.a.
as you know we're all about big viewerships and large audiences here. so i want to tell you about an effort that we're undertaking here in the press briefing room to offer up more access to a group of journalists from around the country.

if trump were merely arguing that many democratic candidates are seeking big changes to medicare, he'd be right. but in contrast to his claims — which make it sound as though democrats are trying to cut benefits — the idea under medicare-for-all is to dramatically expand the program and its benefits to all americans.

these demands for liberty were always partial — often philosophically inconsistent. antiabortion arguments often disguise a powerful role for government in regulating women's bodies; restricting illegal immigration necessarily implicates government prohibition on hiring undocumented employees; in the trump era, efforts to punish china for its trade policies led many on the right to endorse tariffs and quotas that raise prices and inhibit consumer choice — an approach long considered anti-free market. similarly, conservatives who once championed abolition of the fairness doctrine now seem to wish for some sort of government intervention to force social media platforms to look the other way when voices on the right post baseless conspiracy theories, dangerously incorrect health data or even foment violence on their platforms.

for instance, in reaction to nixon's abuses of presidential power, jimmy carter replaced nixon's executive order 11652 on secrecy and classification by issuing his own executive order 12065, requiring more open access to government policies and documents. his successor, reagan, then reversed carter's order with his own (12356), tightening secrecy again. clinton revoked reagan's order with executive order 12958, pushing the government back toward openness. george w. bush then issued executive order 13233 to assert more presidential control over the release of governmental records. and shortly after his inauguration, obama revoked the bush order and later replaced it with his own approach to classification (eo 13526).
cruz, unlike paul and lee, faces reelection in 2018 and is potentially vulnerable to attacks that he has spent his first term fighting with colleagues and running for president rather than delivering for his state. cruz has been a louder obamacare critic than most republicans, embracing a fight against the law that led to the 2013 government shutdown.

from larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation:
but the court ducked that question. instead, it made three critical choices.
the states didn't trust one another, not least because many of them had little in common culturally, ethnographically or politically. new englanders' puritan ancestors had devised their institutions to prevent their greatest fear: the formation of an aristocracy. yet the chesapeake country was run by a landed, slaveholding gentry, complete with english-style manor homes with names like monticello and mount vernon. how would they ever agree on the contours of a shared central government?
in january, the labor department proposed new rules that would widen access to association health plans — originally intended for small businesses that band together — by enabling individual consumers to buy them and reclassifying them so that such plans do not have to include such benefits as maternity care and mental health services. the iowa measure also allows the sale of association health plans that follow the new federal rules.

in any of these scenarios, insurers will face large, unexpected bills that could prompt widespread premium spikes next year.
-- as the difficulty of divided government sinks in, the first president in u.s. history with no prior governing or military experience has changed his tune. on dec. 11, trump said he would be proud to shut down the government: if we don't get what we want, one way or the other ... i will shut down the government, he told schumer and pelosi in the oval office. so i will take the mantle. i will be the one to shut it down. i'm not going to blame you for it.
for example, someone at 200 percent of the federal poverty level wouldn't have to spend more than 2 percent of their income on premiums. those earning 150 percent or less wouldn't have to pay anything. and, for the first time, earners at or above 400 percent of the federal poverty level would be eligible for income-pegged subsidies.

within iowa, this new curve around the aca has sparked debate over whether the strategy is a creative path to offer some residents an alternative to spiking prices in the insurance marketplace the state created under the federal law — or a path to substandard coverage that will divide the healthy from the sick.
the dueling forces came into sharper focus tuesday afternoon, when cruz and other gop senators participated in a health-care meeting with president trump at the white house. at the capitol, mcconnell was expected to deliver more clarity and options to republican senators on the bill that is taking shape. leaders are racing to try to hold a vote as soon as this month, with some eying next month as a more realistic goal. meanwhile, the contours of the senate bill slowly are emerging. last week, mcconnell proposed a more gradual rollback of the expansion of medicaid than a bill that passed the house, as many gop senators have advocated. he also proposed maintaining some protections under obamacare for people with preexisting conditions, another departure from the house bill. that last possibility, however, worried some conservative groups.

i think we have to understand the fact that even the steps that we take today, as aggressive as they are compared to where we were, it's still going to take time to catch up with the problem, christie said. fentanyl deaths going higher are completely predictable because fentanyl is so much stronger and more lethal than street heroin.
by the time trump came into office, the dangers of fentanyl were well known. the drug enforcement administration and the cdc had issued numerous warnings. the fatal overdose rate was staggering.
mulvaney made a simple comparison: he said more people paid a fine for not having health insurance than people who gained from the aca, a.k.a. obamacare. so how do the numbers stack up?
● immigration. the supreme court, dividing 5 to 4 along ideological lines, allowed a trump administration rule to take effect that will make it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain admission to the united state or secure green cards giving them the permission to live and work here. this public charge rule allows authorities new leeway to deny visas to those who they suspect could turn, at any time, to safety-net programs such as food stamps or medicaid.

more than 30 conservative leaders have endorsed the coming plan, signing a letter last month promising it will lower monthly premiums and stabilize markets by giving states more dollars to use as they'd like and expanding private plan options.
trump was elected without much of a mandate, given his narrow margin in the electoral college and his loss in the popular vote. but congressional republicans didn't have much of a mandate, either. although people seemed to forget about it as they focused on trump's upset win at the top of the ticket, republicans lost seats in both the house and the senate in last year's elections.
during the campaign, president trump proposed massive tax relief for the wealthy. with this new statement of principles, it appears the white house may be moving in the direction of doing somewhat more for the middle class — though the details are unclear.
-- the district's virginia suburbs are different from other parts of the state, a fact that got its latest confirmation tuesday when the state senate debated knives. gregory s. schneider reports: sen. richard h. stuart sponsored a bill to make it legal to give dangerous knives to children. specifically, a switchblade, bowie knife or a dirk. several members said they had to look up that last one — it's a straight-bladed dagger wielded by scottish highlanders. virginia law already allows adults to give handguns to someone under age 18, as long as the child is a family member or it's for 'the purpose of engaging in a sporting event or activity.' it prohibits those types of knives, however, and stuart was proposing to change the language to mirror guns. sen. barbara a. favola (d-arlington) was aghast. 'this is just bad public policy,' she said, pointing out that the change would make it legal to give knives to toddlers. 'why would you want to put our children at risk?' 'i understand they may not do that in arlington county,' stuart said. but there's a whooooooole other part of rural virginia where they do do things like that.'
but last fall, a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit in new orleans upheld the louisiana law in a 2-to-1 vote, finding factual distinctions between how the restriction played out in texas and louisiana, robert writes. the full court, considered one of the most conservative of the regional appeals courts, voted not to reconsider the panel's decision.

the administration also expanded its already unnecessary and poorly implemented travel ban to include six additional countries, mostly in africa and including the continent's most populous country, nigeria, on the grounds that they have not done enough to identify or share information about potential terrorists or criminals.
there was no national strategy or plan for vaccinations. we were leaving it to the states and local leaders to try and figure it out. and so in many ways, we're starting from scratch on something that's been raging for almost an entire year! harris said in a recent axios interview.
spicer: ok. two questions. let me start with the latter first. as you know, we hit the ground running on day one. there was a lot to do and we had done a lot of work on the website to make sure that we were prepared to get as much information up as fast as possible. we are continuing to build out the website, both in the issue areas and then that area. but we've got the i.t. folks working overtime right to continue to get all of that up to speed. and trust me, it's just going to take a little bit more time, but we're working piece by piece to get that done.
the impact of the president's remarks:

but brooks-lasure was championed by allies on capitol hill, including the congressional black caucus. as we wrote a few weeks ago, mandy cohen, the north carolina health secretary and a fellow obama veteran, was also considered for the role.
with the numbers that we talked about and the new news (ph) from the inauguration day and the numbers (ph) saturday, do you believe that you have a mandate to be able to force through what you had talked about, replacing portions of obamacare, that really subsidized a whole piece of it to help low-income people get health care?
he was diagnosed with brain cancer, then voted against republicans' efforts to repeal obamacare. he gave speeches and wrote op-eds urging americans to fight trumpism. his very last statement, prepared to be read after his death, was an indictment of trump.

our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces to finally get it done? on this and so many other things, democrats and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the american people.

spicer: well, i -- i think i've answered it twice now. i -- we are at the early stages in this decision making process.
holler and his compatriots are reasoning that the political pressure from democrats will eventually build to the point that gop house and senate members in tough races will decide they must rally around a health-care plan — even though multiple versions of repeal-and-replace failed to gain enough traction in the senate last year, and the stakes are even higher as republicans try to hold onto their house majority (i explained more fully in this health 202 why it's even harder to repeal obamacare now compared to last year.)
the agreement is the clearest evidence yet that the split between gordon, a central figure in the state's response to covid-19, and whitmer was not amicable, and it shows the democratic administration used taxpayer funds to ease his departure, the detroit news's craig mauger reports.
spicer: no, that's actually what i said. it's not what -- i don't know how you can interpret it differently. that's literally what i said. to witness it in person and around the globe. total audience yes.

but with the trump administration now pledging to take on the high cost of prescription medicines...grogan, as omb's associate director of health programs, will be in a pivotal position shaping drug policy — including aspects of medicare and medicaid...some critics see a conflict, david writes. grogan is hardly the only former lobbyist or industry official in the top ranks of the administration, but he is an exception among senior federal health policymakers for not completing federal ethics forms that laid out potential conflicts with his past work and what, if any, activities he would recuse himself from. hhs secretary alex azar and centers for medicare & medicaid services administrator seema verma completed such forms.
and uninsured patients who require hospitalization will incur tens of thousands of dollars in costs.
in an interview this week, cruz said he was not remotely compelled to vote for just any gop health-care bill to protect his image.
question: narrowing down his nominees, i should say.
contrast that with the soullessness, selfishness and cruelty of the president and his policies. what faith tells one to demonize the stranger, deny care for the sick, destroy the planet we've been given and snatch children from the arms of their parents? what religion tells us to prefer white immigrants over nonwhites? president trump's policies are not only wrongheaded (e.g. counterproductive) but just plain wrong.
even if one factors in all the struggles the health-care law has faced, these are rather extreme statements. the aca cut the uninsured rate by about half (although lately the uninsured rate has been creeping back up) by providing subsidized coverage to millions of americans. it ensured more comprehensive coverage to those with employer-sponsored plans. it allowed states to expand medicaid.
spicer: i think he has ordered it. he's going to -- as i mentioned, he'll be at the department of defense on friday to swear in general mattis as his next secretary -- well, to, you know, go through the ceremony of that. he is obviously the secretary of defense. and so, you know, at that time he will continue to have conversations about what he wants from -- from them and the joint chiefs. shannon(ph)?
the central tenet of medicare-x also closely aligns with biden's vision.
-- the white house has beefed up its legal team and plans to aggressively invoke executive privilege in a bid to contain the potential fallout of the mueller report and curtail oversight by house democrats. carol d. leonnig reports: the strategy to strongly assert the president's executive privilege on both fronts is being developed under newly arrived white house counsel pat cipollone, who has hired 17 lawyers in recent weeks to help in the effort. he is coordinating with white house lawyer emmet flood, who is leading the response to [mueller's] report. … of particular concern to democrats: whether the white house will seek to use executive privilege to keep private any portions of mueller's report that addresses alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
it's not clear if it has occurred to him, and others, what should be obvious: the first amendment protects private speech from government censorship, but not from de-platforming by a private concern. or that twitter's decision to ban trump, or a publisher's decision to cancel publication of hawley's book, are expressions of corporate values that reflect market forces. some argue that twitter is more like a public utility than a private outlet — and therefore shouldn't censor certain voices — but that view runs counter to how conservatives have framed the role of private enterprise: twitter isn't the phone company; it's the christian-owned bakery, or hobby lobby.
also with us are susan oliver and jessica davis. their husbands –- deputy sheriff danny oliver and detective michael davis –- were slain in the line of duty in california. they were pillars of their community. these brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
on gitmo, i think you're gonna see further action. i don't want to get ahead of the president, but this is something that has been discussed and has -- it is in his current decision-making process how he wants to handle that.
question: yeah, but you've had a lot of time to make those promises.
biden seems ready to focus on four aspects of the covid-19 crisis.
trump's approach is a hallmark of a president who eschews strategic planning and preparation in favor of day-to-day tactical maneuvering and trusting his gut. but as he digs in against an emboldened democratic opposition, trump has found that his go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics has laid bare his shortcomings as a negotiator — preventing him from finding a way out of what may be the biggest political crisis of his presidency, david nakamura and seung min kim explain in today's paper.
for cruz, the looming dilemma is the same one confronting many conservatives who, like him, rose to prominence during barack obama's presidency in part on the promise of ripping up the president's affordable care act: is it better to accept a final bill that falls short of the repeal they have long championed or walk away from it?

then the news broke yesterday that trump has asked comey to stay on. normally, this would not be surprising because he's only four years into a 10-year term. but the president had said previously that he would not decide whether he should stay on until they had a private meeting.
he also pledged that he won't cave:
question: (inaudible) political priorities. what would be the message for the hispanic commune in the u.s. taking into consideration that one of the priorities has been the wall?
combine that with the tens of million of people that watched it online, on a device. it's unquestionable. i -- i don't -- and i don't see any numbers that -- that dispute that when you add up attendance, viewership, total audience in terms(ph) of tablets, phones, on television. i'd love to see any information that proves that otherwise.
developing alliances is a key caucus strategy
third, in several passages the majority resisted any broad exemption for religiously motivated merchants who object to serving same-sex couples, whether on free-speech grounds or on other constitutional grounds. justice kennedy said, for example, that society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity or worth — and that the exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight by the courts.
while the united states saw a steady decline in cases and hospitalizations since a peak in late january, that downward trend has stalled in recent days, and cases have actually began to inch up in some places.
spicer: sure, it was the most watched inaugural. when you look at -- look, you look at just the one network alone got 16.9 million people online. another couple of the networks there were tens of million people that watched that online. never mind the audience that was here, the 31 million people watching it on television.
it's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and i want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress i've made in keeping those promises.
hot on the left: pelosi, schumer response tops trump speech in preliminary ratings, from the hill: according to early numbers from nielsen, the quarter hour from 9 to 9:15 p.m. est that included the president's address attracted a combined 28.1 rating in metered markets on abc, cbs, nbc, fox, fox news, cnn and msnbc. the 15 minutes that followed immediately after that included remarks by pelosi and schumer registered 29.3 across those same networks. the early numbers also show that the pelosi-schumer response beat trump by 26 percent on cnn and 15 percent on msnbc, according to deadline. deadline also notes the trump address and democratic response got an equal number of viewers on fox news. hot on the right: holocaust group sought reconsideration of angela davis honor, from the ap: an alabama civil rights organization withdrew a planned human rights award from political activist angela davis after a group that educates alabamians about the holocaust asked them to reconsider the honor. the birmingham holocaust education center wrote to the birmingham civil rights institute on jan. 2 expressing 'concern and disappointment' about the plan to honor davis with an award named for minister and civil rights pioneer fred l. shuttlesworth. the letter urged the institute to 'reconsider your decision.' the holocaust group cited 'recent outspoken support' of a boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against israel, al.com reported.

staffer contact with these organizations may skew their perceptions of the public because the groups are more ideologically conservative than the public along the range of issues we study, the researchers wrote.
i believe it's going to be terminated, whether it be through the texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case. you would think it would have to be terminated, trump said in a recent interview with the new york times.
i can't -- i know we're getting really into like facts. so just to be clear, there were no trump or white house folks sitting down. they were all cia (inaudible). so not in rows one through anything, from what i'm told.
officials are still considering — but have not decided yet — whether to indefinitely shutter the program that allows syrian refugees into the u.s. trump may also put the entire refugee program for all countries on hold for four months: one official said trump will also potentially bar for 30 days the issuance of u.s. visas to people from iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen — all muslim-majority countries — until new visa procedures are developed. residents from many of these places are already rarely granted u.s. visas. trump may ask dhs and the director of national intelligence to evaluate whether immigrants are being adequately screened for potential terrorist ties.

in my new book about the freedom caucus, i identified 18 instances in which the organization tried to shape political or policy outcomes during its first two years. it succeeded (at least partially) 11 times, an impressive rate of success for a small group of lawmakers. but the caucus didn't only use threats to win; sometimes it developed partnerships with powerful individuals.
-- sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) is reportedly tentatively planning to announce her 2020 campaign over mlk weekend in oakland, the city where she was born and began her legal career. from kcbs radio's doug sovern: even though harris has alluded to a 2020 presidential campaign in interviews to promote her new memoir, aides said before the book rollout began that no formal announcement about her political future is expected before the first wave of the book tour concludes later this month. but several sources with knowledge of her plans said she has in fact decided to run, with the enthusiastic blessing of her husband and two stepchildren. the debate within her camp has been how, and where, to launch her campaign. a person close to harris denied the report to politico, saying that no final decision has been made but that it won't be in oakland on mlk weekend.
but to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement.
question: on immigration, the chief of staff -- i think, it said over the weekend, seemed to suggest that an executive order shutting down the daca program had been ruled out. is that officially ruled out as you guys go forward? and does the -- does the president support action in congress that would, essentially permanently establish those protections for those.

some democrats also urged more must be done. sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.):
spicer: i think that the president has noted that this was a serious priority of his throughout the campaign. he has already started to work with congress on the appropriations avenue of that. and so he is doing everything he can to direct agencies and congress to commence with that work as soon as possible.
that hasn't been happening, however. the country is so politically polarized that many members of congress are now elected on a promise to resist the kind of compromise that is necessary to build majorities and be an effective check on executive power .
spicer: no, i think that he's been very clear throughout the campaign that he is committed to making sure that the american people, the american tax payer, see some benefit, and ensure that our interests overseas are not just (inaudible) sending blank checks. that we're doing something that either protects america or is in our economic interest.
cruz's current role is one few would have predicted a couple of years ago for a man who once called mcconnell a liar on the senate floor and who, from his earliest days in the senate, set aside the chamber's customary politeness and built a foundation for his 2016 presidential bid centered on fighting the political establishment.
other factors beyond cruz could scuttle the senate talks. opposition by sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) and susan collins (r-maine) to a measure that blocks funding to planned parenthood is among them.

* bring back the public option! paul krugman points out that if trump really wanted to fix obamacare, he could do so, by spending more money and taking other steps to remedy the fact that insurers have pulled out of the market in certain geographic areas:
-- the top three senate republicans refused yesterday to disavow trump's false claim that millions cast ballots illegally. from the associated press's erica werner and lisa lerer: the comments from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and his top lieutenants suggested that some leading republicans would rather follow trump into the realm of 'alternative facts' than confront the new chief executive. 'it does occur,' mcconnell told reporters at the capitol tuesday on the issue of election fraud. 'there are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent and all the rest. ... the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.' the no. 2 senate republican, john cornyn of texas, also passed up a chance to dispute trump's claim tuesday, saying 'i'm not going to re-litigate that. it's time to move on.' and the no. 3 senate republican, john thune, said he didn't know whether 3 million to 5 million votes were cast fraudulently, which would be larger than the population of all but the biggest u.s. cities [and especially his tiny home state of south dakota!], and did not happen. 'there's always a certain amount of irregularity that goes on in elections, some places perhaps more so than others. how you quantify that i'm not sure, but he must have his methodology,' thune said.
to that end, medicare-x proposes adding a public option plan first in the parts of the country where consumers have the fewest private marketplace options, then moving to areas with higher plan costs and finally expanding into every zip code in the country by 2025. the aim is to give consumers more options, while also putting competitive pressure on private plans to lower their costs.
-- it will be cold and windy in d.c. today, foreshadowing possible weekend snow. the capital weather gang forecasts: sunshine is back in control. a few scattered clouds race by as northwest winds gust as high as 35 mph. highs in the upper 30s to low 40s feel about 10 degrees colder thanks to those unabating winds.
hours of negotiations halted just before midnight. schumer and treasury secretary steve mnuchin were optimistic a deal would be announced today. schumer told reporters mnuchin called the president, we told him we were very, very close to an agreement; he seemed very happy with that and wanted us to try to — get us to get it done tomorrow.
congressional democrats still seized the opportunity to tout the law's expansion of coverage to around 20 million americans through the individual marketplaces and medicaid expansion and its requirements for plans to cover essential services — including hospital visits and vaccinations, services that are particularly relevant during this pandemic.
but interpreted one way — the most obvious way — mccain seemed to have come to a conclusion about how trump is president: he helped lead the way.
and i think part of this is ensuring that we sequence these, that gives the american people the proper -- issue the proper attention that they deserve because part of it is that when -- and if we put them all out in one day, they get lose -- they get lost in the ether, i think, and i think he made these promises and pledges to the american people because they're important to him. so...
spicer: no, no. but i think there's a difference between having differences with intelligence leaders and leaders of that community who we have strong differences with than the people and the men and women who toil every single day in our intelligence community.
several senators have suggested that the gop bill should keep at least some of the taxes, perhaps even including the widely panned tax on high-value employer plans known as the cadillac tax. the logic, according to aides, is that senators could delay the implementation of some taxes or promise to repeal others later, when they take up their next big agenda item: tax reform. but gop leaders do not have a clear path forward on that, and conservatives are anxious about leaving any of the aca taxes in place.
earlier this week, the biden administration announced it is restoring a modest amount of funds for community groups to help people enroll. the trump administration had slashed funding for these marketplace navigators.
in a critique of the senate's better care reconciliation act, several heritage experts advocated for shifting medicaid to what's known as a premium support system involving private plans, rolling back obamacare's requirements for insurers to cover certain preventive services, and permanently repealing its tax on high-cost health plans.
potentially dangerous clashes could develop: if trump were to ask the military to target terrorists' families — an idea he has at various times proposed and disavowed — some military and intelligence officials have said that commanders might refuse to follow such orders.
spicer: oh, i think i said it, because i think the multi -- when you enter into these multinational agreements, you're allowing any country, no matter the size -- any one of those 12, including us, to basically have the same stature as the united states in the agreement. so we're basically on par with some very small companies who are getting access to an amazing market, the united states. and in return, we're negotiating at the lowest common denominator. and i think that when you look at big multinational agreements -- multilateral agreements -- they're not always in the best interest of the united states.
spicer: i think the readout -- i just gave you the readout on the call with president el-sisi. i think that -- that speaks for itself what was discussed. and then -- i'm sorry, the first part?
buttigieg and biden also separately expressed support for allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs.
4. what is that case about?
jane schacter: that depends on who will be deciding cases in the future.
but as the size and scope of government ballooned, the president became the de facto manager of a sprawling, vital sector of the economy, and presidential authority expanded almost continuously. a century ago, theodore roosevelt argued that presidents were allowed to do anything not specifically prohibited by law or the constitution. and nixon famously asserted, after he had resigned from office over the watergate scandal, that when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.
as john mitchell famously said when he became richard nixon's attorney general, watch what we do, not what we say.
this goes to a serious problem with the brain-dead conservative movement: its failure to recognize that freedom is one value but not necessarily paramount to others, such as preventing cruelty or eradicating racism.

because an investigation of jackson is ongoing, it's not clear whether the senate armed services committee will move on his new promotion nomination.
schultz: ok, what -- what i would do to fix it, first off, is diagnose the problem. and diagnosing the problem is that we have layers and layers and layers of government bureaucracy. no one knows who's in charge. there's no transparency of records. veterans are waiting weeks and months for prescription drugs. there's all kinds of problems.
to jamiel, jenna, susan and jessica: i want you to know –- we will never stop fighting for justice. your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.
one of the hidden morals of the great republican health care crackup of 2017 is that the american people flatly rejected replacing the aca with something substantially more regressive. the gop plan would have cut medicaid spending by $800 billion, leaving 14 million fewer people with medicaid coverage, while delivering an enormous tax cut to the rich. americans clearly disapproved of this outcome. a recent quinnipiac poll found that a majority opposed the gop plan, but more to the point, 74 percent of voters, including 54 percent of republicans, opposed cutting medicaid. the public broadly opposed the gop plan's most prominent mechanism for rolling back spending to cover poor people.
-- conservative radio host hugh hewitt thinks trump is on constitutional thin ice and could face impeachment if democrats retake the house of representatives in 2018. president trump has to be aware of the constitutional thin ice on which he skates, he told katie couric in a yahoo news interview, referring to ethics concerns over the handling of trump's vast business network. i think it would occur after midterms and only if the house flips to the democrats. so the potential is there, yes. ... if you abuse power, if you do anything — you don't have a lot of goodwill in the reservoir.
the more liberal arm of the democratic party, though, has been pushing for years to go further. what in 2004 was a fairly quiet push for single-payer — that is, government-centralized — health care championed by former vermont governor howard dean had, by 2016, become sen. bernie sanders's (i-vt.) medicare-for-all campaign platform. as 2020 looms, announced democratic primary candidates have broadly supported the idea of going a step further than obamacare in ensuring coverage for all americans.
after spending the 2020 campaign promising to make health coverage more affordable, they're happy to pass legislation helping to fulfill that pledge. and they can make the case that helping people get covered is more essential than ever during the pandemic.
in other words, democrats will proceed from the premise that, just as on health care, gop ideas on taxes will also be deeply unpopular, even among trump voters.

spicer: look, i'm not -- i think that you saw from the response the other day, he walked into the cia, people were hooting and hollering, they gave him a five minute standing ovation. that doesn't look like a relationship that's a -- i mean, they were excited --

she and others seemed unimpressed with brat's recitation of his grass-roots credentials, which helped him topple house majority leader eric cantor in 2014. cantor was criticized for being aloof and out of touch with his constituents — many of the same accusations now plaguing brat.
according to a new monmouth university poll, half of americans say the president has done a good job handling the crisis, compared with 72 percent who say their state's governor has done a good job.
following the president's nomination of jackson to head va last year, sen. jon tester (d-mont.), the ranking member of the veterans' affairs committee, released a two-page memo of allegations against jackson, claiming he drank on the job, freely handed out medication, and created a hostile workplace. the white house disputed the most serious of the claims, our colleagues report.
after reading gary abernathy's latest paean to the president, i am not sure which is worse: that he is the editor of a news publication or that he was invited to meet with graduate students at the columbia journalism school in new york.
with a partial wall near their homes, three neighbors in penitas, tex., react to president trump's call to expand the barrier on the mexican border. (drea cornejo, jon gerberg/the washington post)
but to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the american economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the united states, and much harder for companies to leave.
ahh: obamacare enrollment went significantly better in the 11 states plus the district of columbia that run their own marketplaces, the national academy for state health policy finds in a new report. the post's amy goldstein reports overall signups stayed essentially level from the year before -- while enrollment fell by an average of 5 percent in the states using the federal-run healthcare.gov website. and who did best of all? the five states with hybrid federal-state marketplaces.
conway said she never saw the letter.
finally, biden plainly wants this to be about a contrast in leadership styles. in place of trump's bombast, irrationality and vindictiveness, biden presents a calm and empathetic figure. who do americans want to listen to for the next four years, and who do they trust to guide them through the recovery from america's worst domestic disaster in a century? on that, biden is betting the contest won't be close.
congress acted within weeks to authorize war, pass the patriot act and establish the department of homeland security — a sharp contrast to the administration's failure to move on domestic initiatives such as overhauling social security and reforming immigration. what made the difference, hagin said, was public opinion, and trump's knack for blunt communication could be an effective defense against efforts by congress to rein him in.

remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
and there's a rush to judgment every time. and it's a two-way street. we want to have a healthy and open dialogue with the press corps and with the american people about what he's doing to help this country and to unite it.
we arrive at the first stop of the day, a speech at a christian bookstore nestled between a gas station and a walmart. cruz heads off his bus to speak with the press. of course there's a comment about the weather.
politico's jennifer haberkorn noted a glaring omission in the budget deal: neither of the bipartisan marketplace stabilization measures to help insurers lowers the cost of obamacare premiums.
the wall has never been a popular idea, a fact known to most republicans in congress. a litany of public and private polling shows that over 50 percent of americans oppose building a wall. support is in the high 30s to low 40s. public support for shutting down the government to force construction of a wall is lower.
well, look, the american people aren't as concerned about the political debate as they are concerned about what's really happening at the border, he said.

and it would be once -- nice once in a while for someone just to say -- report it straight up, he appointed this person, here's their background. not why they're not gonna get nominated, not why it's not gonna happen.
hundreds of va workers were fired every month, even before trump signed the bipartisan veterans affairs accountability and whistleblower protection act. and in 2014, congress passed a law aiming to make it easier to remove senior officials because of poor performance or misconduct.
what mitch mcconnell said after a bipartisan meeting with trump about scotus yesterday afternoon:
—repealing the affordable care act's independent payment advisory board, a medicare cost-cutting board that has never actually been implemented but which republicans have slammed for years.
ninety-four million americans are out of the labor force.
the president previously nominated jackson to lead veterans affairs, but the doctor withdrew his nomination over allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, claims still under investigation by the pentagon, our post colleagues dan lamothe and josh dawsey report.
2. trump has made all sorts of dubious claims about the 2010 affordable care act, calling it crazy, a disaster and not working. he has made such claims 80 times.
first, we should ensure that americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the health-care exchanges.
-- a secret service agent may face disciplinary action after posting comments to facebook suggesting that she would not take a bullet for president trump. abby phillip reports: …this world has changed and i have changed, the agent wrote in the newly-surfaced posting from october. and i would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what i believe to be a disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here.

3. which parts have been eliminated?
what's more, several arguments that might be used against the idea of creating a single-payer plan spurred sharp opposition to the proposal. that it guarantees coverage and would eliminate out-of-pocket costs was popular; that taxes might increase and delays might increase were not. (note that some of these arguments would themselves be contested.)
rep. abigail spanberger (d-va.), who represents a district trump won in 2016, said at a closed-door caucus meeting yesterday that democrats are losing the messaging war in her district and need to be clearer about the border security measures they support. if i am getting comments and contact from my constituents expressing concern that the democrats are not prioritizing security, then i think we can do better, she told her colleagues, per politico.
the tax policy center projects that taxpayers exploiting this potential loophole could reduce the taxes the government collects by $2.6 trillion over 20 years. that is more than half as much as the main component of the individual plan, the reduction in rates on ordinary income. the lower rates are forecast to cost $4 trillion over the same period.
there's been a lot of focus on how the 2020 candidates are picking sides between medicare-for-all and the public option approach. many of them have moved towards a more moderate position, a shift that was most evident last night in warren, who spoke enthusiastically about shoring up obamacare and barely mentioned medicare-for-all.
the cato institute hosts a discussion on needle exchange programs.
chuck grassley posted this photo of himself coming out of the white house:
more broadly, the strategy is among the ripple effects across the country from congress and the trump administration having decreed that americans who flout the law's individual insurance mandate will no longer be charged penalties. when enforcement of the mandate ends next year, consumers will not risk a fine for being uninsured or having health coverage that lacks some of the aca's required benefits and consumer protections.
the new may target is two months earlier than the administration's previous goal of having enough vaccine doses for every adult by july. the accelerated timeline reflects new confidence from the administration in production schedules from the nation's vaccine makers, the post's christopher rowland and laurie mcginley report.
so even if kennedy was replaced with someone more like gorsuch, we do not know if there would be five votes for a broader religious-liberty claim than the limited one accepted in masterpiece.
when somebody is saying, 'i'm ready for treatment' and they want help, they shouldn't have to wait six months, six weeks or six days, said steve williams, mayor of huntington, the county seat of cabell. they should be able to get in a treatment program within six hours.
question: but isn't that just part of the conversation that happens in washington...
--we're keeping our eyes on the house today, where it's still unclear whether republicans can pass the spending agreement without any help from democrats. the measure would increase what's called discretionary spending — areas such as scientific research, education, roads and health care that are funded year-to-year by appropriations — by 21 percent over existing budget caps, irking some conservatives who are warning it would set up trillion-dollar-a-year deficits.
the constitutional order set up by our founders is breaking down, sen. mike lee (r-utah) wrote this month in national review. what congress wants today is to be weak... for fear of the political consequences of hard choices.
spicer: i think areas in the south china sea that are part of international waters and international activities i think the u.s. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there. so it's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of china proper, then yes, we're gonna make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country. does that answer...
-- throughout history, autocratic leaders have relied on walls to control their people, nina khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at the new school, writes in an op-ed for nbc. from the fierce tyrant who first began building china's great wall in roughly 220 bc to soviet leader nikita s. khrushchev (my great-grandfather as it happens) who ordered construction of the berlin wall in 1961, walls have represented undemocratic forces.
spicer: i -- no. i think what he was talking about was the process, not the people, and that's a very different thing.
but then the quiet voices became a loud chorus — as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
question: yes, he did say that --
and iowa voters care a lot about health care. forty-five percent of iowa caucus-goers say it is their no. 1 concern, according to the monmouth poll released this week. that's down from 56 percent in august but still ranks above any other single issue – including beating president trump and climate change.
senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.):
question: (inaudible) financial times. does mr. trump agree with rex tillerson that the u.s. should try and prevent china from accessing the islands in the south china sea where it's building runways and other kinds of facilities?
moreover, in 2010, the aca began requiring all insurers to allow young adults up to age 25 to enroll in a parent's health plan. most analysts generally accept that the number of people who gained insurance because of the provision is 2.3 million.
spicer: well, first, i would argue that bilateral deals are mostly what china's been engaging in, and that's something that i just said that we're gonna -- you know, the president's gonna look to countries to engage with.
then in february, the department of health and human services proposed to broaden americans' ability to rely on short-term health plans that similarly circumvent the aca's required benefits and protections. such plans could be sold for up to a year, rather than the current three months, and federal officials have said they would like them to be renewable from year to year.
i've talked to a lot of people that support medicare-for-all, freshman rep. donna shalala (d-fla.), who served as health and human services secretary under president bill clinton, told me. i said i wanted to do medicaid-for-all. that's a better program.
question: i have two questions. one on dac - on daca (ph), i was just curious about the message from this administration from the white house to young people who may qualify and not yet have their pension. should they enroll going forward and those who are in the program now seek renewal?
the epidemic was a key issue in important swing states. the journal of the american medical association found a correlation between chronic use of prescription painkillers and regions that supported trump. medicare reimbursements for opioid prescriptions also documented the epidemic's disproportionate impact on areas where trump polled well.
sen. ted cruz's current role is one few would have predicted a just a couple of years ago. (carolyn kaster/ap)
the states live in a period of uncertainty, so when you see stable enrollment, it's good, said trish riley, nashp's executive director. despite repeated assertions by trump that the marketplaces are essentially dead, the message is, people want coverage, and they came and got it, riley said.
there are plenty of fair critiques of medicare-for-all, as envisioned by sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.), elizabeth warren (d-mass.), rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) and other liberal democrats. it would massively inflate federal spending and could prompt provider shortages if the payment rates were set too low.
this is part of an organized attempt to create fear in other places and chill the effects of passing legislation, laura mcquade, the president and ceo of planned parenthood new york city, told our colleagues. it is sexy for the right. they are trying to shut down other laws.
-- the ex-north korean diplomat who defected to seoul with his family last year spoke to the post for his first-ever foreign media interview. our anna fifield writes up their fascinating discussion: over the past month, [thae yong-ho] has predicted to south korean media the demise of north korea with the same fervor with which he once extolled its glories. his hard line statements happen to fit nicely with the hawkish stance taken by the south korean government over the past eight years, but thae said he was not being expedient and was speaking his real mind — and was intent on using his influence for good. 'i've known that there was no future for north korea for a long time,' thae [said] … [and] his arrival in south korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections … 'there is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between kim jong un and senior officials,' thae said. 'senior officials know that this system can't continue.'
in march, the justice department sided with 20 republican-led states seeking to invalidate the entire act as unconstitutional. trump then said senate gop leaders were writing legislation to repeal and replace the aca. but republicans quickly signaled that they had little appetite for raising an explosive issue just as the 2020 political season was getting underway.
it's too vague and it's not enough money, said andrew kolodny, a professor at brandeis university, who says he thinks congress should spend at least $12 billion over two years.
in recent decades, presidents have stretched their ability to act unilaterally, bypassing congress through executive orders, executive memos, national security orders, findings, signing statements and prosecutorial discretion. after vietnam and watergate, congress pushed back with a series of laws designed to rein in the president.
his comments came even as moderate senate democrats maneuvered to limit some of the expenditures in the bill, over objections from liberals who insisted they had already made concessions on biden's first major legislative proposal, the post's erica werner reports.
if republicans are searching for a conservatism that can work in the modern era, they should first stop lying to their own voters and look to examples such as britain's to bring their party into the world of facts and reality.
the house intelligence committee ran a mickey mouse investigation of the russia matter that failed to called dozens of relevant witnesses and did not look for collusion, thereby allowing it to claim there was no collusion. ryan sat silently as republican committee members cooked up a misleading memo and conducted a smear campaign against the fbi. the speaker also objected to a select committee or an independent commission on russian interference in our election, and will not consider legislation to protect special counsel robert s. mueller iii or deputy attorney general rod j. rosenstein.
minnesota gov. mark dayton said he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. the news comes just hours after he fainted during his state of the state address, setting off alarm bells and prompting questions about his health, though he recovered shortly after. in a news conference, dayton said he had planned to disclose the cancer next week after further tests and visits with his doctor. i don't expect it to impede my performance or responsibilities, he said, but i'll know more next week.

ouch: the cdc says states should prioritize vaccinations for people with disabilities.
over the weekend, trump tweeted: obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. this reaffirmed what he'd said on friday, which is that the law will soon cease to exist — that democrats will own the fallout and will be desperate to deal. as many quickly pointed out, this suggested trump may go further than merely standing by as the law supposedly implodes, as he had previously contemplated doing, and may seek to actively harm the law. on fox news sunday, reince priebus declined to divulge the strategy.
brat, who seemed a little startled at the beginning of the evening, said afterward that he didn't mind the constant jeering and that he understood the country's divisions have deepened since the election.
christine was my guardian angel, said proffit, who has been clean since february. she never gave up on me. they turned me around 180 degrees.
question: (inaudible) go back to one publisher (ph) (inaudible). those with knowledge of who was in the room in the lobby of the cia that senior leadership were not among those hooting and hollering and that were some 40 people who were in the first front rows who were brought in by trump and pence and pompeo. i'd like to give you a chance to respond to that recording.
she said the doctor advised her not to get tested — and noted she's been away from her husband for the past two weeks and is outside the 14-day period for getting sick.
at least four of the photos were found to be altered, our post colleague joe heim reports. a placard that proclaims god hates trump has trump blotted out so that it reads god hates. a sign that reads trump & gop — hands off women has the word trump blurred out.
i am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of african-american and latino children. these families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.
president-day civil liberties advocates fear session's and trump's views on voter fraud could serve as a basis for them to support voter id laws that disenfranchise poor or minority voters, such as the one in north carolina that was overturned by the supreme court last summer. studies have shown in-person voter fraud, which the laws are designed to prevent, is exceptionally rare. they are also concerned that sessions hailed as 'good news, i think, for the south' a supreme court decision that gutted a critical section of the voting rights act.… one of sessions's early tests will be how — if he is confirmed — his justice department handles a voter id law in texas considered one of the strictest in the country.
in a may 3, 2018, letter to conway, wen pleaded with the trump administration to use its influence to lower the price of naloxone. the brand name of the drug, narcan, cost $75 for two doses. in the previous three years, naloxone had reversed more than 10,000 overdoses in baltimore, wen said.
if twitter were required to allow trump to remain on its platform, even if it concludes that he has serially violated its terms of service — if private companies were required to host parler, even after determining that anti-democratic rhetoric proliferated on its platform — that wouldn't be a win for the first amendment or the marketplace of ideas. it would be a top-down mandate that private concerns are required to tolerate, and indirectly participate in, the dissemination of misinformation and of lawlessness, imposed by an arbitrary standard of fairness.
the link from mccain to trump goes something like this: the republican senator from arizona elevated palin, then the gop governor of alaska, by picking her as his vice presidential nominee in 2008. palin in turn helped stir up and elevate certain factions on the right -- notably the kind of people who called barack obama an arab. eight years later, america elected a man to the white house who had questioned obama's birth certificate and whose base of voters fit neatly into the same categories as those who supported palin.
-- john mccain slammed omb director-designee mick mulvaney over defense spending and his vote to withdraw troops from europe and afghanistan. politico's ben weyl and brent griffiths report: 'don't you know where 9/11 came from?' mccain asked at one point at the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee. the defense hawk said he was 'deeply concerned' about mulvaney's nomination and ripped mulvaney for saying he couldn't recall some of his voting record. 'i think i would remember if i was withdrawing troops from europe,' mccain said. mccain also slammed mulvaney for trying to shrink the overseas contingency operations account, which is intended to pay for wars abroad but has been used as a way to get around strict spending caps. after the hearing, mccain said he had not decided whether he would vote for mulvaney. asked whether he was satisfied with mulvaney's answers, an angry mccain deadpanned, 'you could tell, just totally.'
it's all fentanyl now, proffit said in an interview. the county is flooded with fentanyl.
his answers seemed to antagonize most in the crowd of 150, who yelled back at him, at points drowning him out and prompting a few of his supporters to leave early in disgust.
and mitch mcconnell met his colleague's new puppy:
many staffers admitted changing their minds about a policy topic after speaking with a lobbying group that had given money to their boss's campaign. 45% of staffers agreed they had developed a new perspective about a policy after speaking with a group that provided campaign contributions to their member, the authors write. this result suggests that a potentially large share of senior congressional staffers have had their thinking about policy shaped by interest groups that provided their member campaign contributions.
— the supreme court issued a temporary stay on a restrictive louisiana law that challengers say would leave the state with only one doctor eligible to perform abortions.

— republican fears that sen. john mccain's (r-ariz.) battle with cancer could make it harder to keep their senate majority have receded, with a crucial election deadline just days away, our colleagues sean sullivan and michael scherer report. republicans in arizona and washington are increasingly hopeful mccain will be in office through may 30, the unofficial date for averting a special election for his seat this year. the gop, which holds a 51-to-49 senate majority, is defending the arizona seat held by retiring sen. jeff flake (r). another race in the state would give democrats a new opening to win control of the senate.
spicer: i -- i -- that's a great question. i believe there's an action that has to be taken under the -- the provision of nafta where you set -- you send notice to the other countries, the other two countries.

azar told trump he was doing everything he could but that much of his work was being stopped or hampered, they add.
emails released as part of massachusetts' lawsuit against the drugmaker reveal how the family pushed the products. in one email, former purdue president richard sackler personally directed sales representatives to push doctors to prescribe extremely high doses of opioids, our colleagues report, even as healey claims the family knew such a move would put patients at risk.
carroll, who had been appointed acting drug czar in february 2018, disputed that characterization and said the administration has taken numerous steps to combat the opioid crisis. he noted that the drug czar's office is only one of several agencies that are trying to battle the epidemic and that he is in close contact with them. despite the repeated attempts by the office of management and budget to slash his budget, carroll said he has the full support of the white house. he also said he has proposed spending an additional $1.3 billion on anti-drug efforts.

when is this meaning and -- going to be set or is it coming up soon? and will the president be meeting with the full body of the congressional black caucus as well as the hispanic caucus on issues related to those communities?
certainly democrats should talk about how trump has undermined national unity, civility and stature in the world, but democrats should also pay attention to what voters are saying. they hate the chaos, the tweets, the constant turmoil. perhaps let america be sane may be the most effective thing a democrat has to offer. hence, they better pick someone calm, authoritative, reliable and drama-free.
again and again she shouted: you're misinformed!
6. if obamacare survives, what does biden want to do with it?
in 2018, the administration announced it wouldn't defend the aca in a legal challenge from gop-led states. at the time, the justice department filed a brief saying the law's preexisting condition protections can't exist without the law's penalty for lacking coverage (which congress had repealed).
hillary clinton believes very strongly that fbi director james comey cost her the election with his two announcements during the run-up to nov. 8, and she's angry that he did not publicly discuss evidence of russian interference on behalf of trump. comey's decisions to discuss the clinton probe publicly are currently being investigated by the justice department inspector general. at a white house reception on sunday, trump literally embraced comey. he's become more famous than me, the president said.
starting with this current legislative effort, the senate should maximize its opportunity to provide individual americans with better and more affordable health care options by making further changes to free states from obamacare's centralized insurance mandates, improve medicaid reform, and provide individual americans with better health care options, they wrote last june.
a cruz supporter sat at the bar at the next stop, drinking a beer. people waited and cruz showed up — only to tape a segment for hannity that would air on fox news later in the night.
becerra's confirmation hearing before the senate finance committee was marked by sharp exchanges over abortion, with republican lawmakers questioning whether his involvement in litigation on reproductive health issues would present a conflict of interest. gop senators also pressed the nominee on his previous support for medicare-for-all.
question: and a follow-up. on the other side of this, another group that's coming...
a republican congressman explained the reason for the gridlock to a post reporter:
note that these are not the number of executive orders issued by presidents, but rather the number of previous executive orders reversed by each president; some executive orders reverse more than one previous executive order.
trump also said addiction was a deeply personal issue for him. his older brother, fred jr., who suffered from alcoholism, died in 1981 at age 43.
question: what about with obamacare, are you guys enforcing the mandate or not?
will the presidency be effectively persuasive when wielded by a president who's widely viewed as dishonest?
when we are talking about healthcare, the details really matter and therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work, clinton said. he didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either and tonight he's come out with a new plan and again we need to get into the details.
hardiman , 51, was the first in his family to attend college and drove a taxi to finance his education – a backstory trump may find appealing. he serves on the 3rd circuit with trump's sister maryanne trump barry, and is praised for his record on gun rights.
meanwhile, the uppermost marginal rate — paid by the most affluent households — will be 35 percent, according this document, as opposed to the 33 percent that trump proposed during the campaign. (it is currently just under 40 percent.)

it's a comprehensive look at how we're keeping people out of this country that shouldn't be here, that people who are coming to visit are leaving when they're supposed to, to make sure that we're tailoring immigration policies that make sure that we're not an open door for anyone to just walk in, that the people who are here to visit our country safely or to come here to bring jobs or to support our economy are coming in. but i think he have to do immigration smartly, and that's what he's looking at.
but this much is clear: the coronavirus outbreak, which killed 100 people in the united state in a single day yesterday, will further strain a u.s. health-care system whose patients are already plagued by perpetually rising costs and inefficiencies all around.

the stock market has gained almost 3 trillion dollars in value since the election on november 8th, a record. we've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new f-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government. we have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.
there's a, you know, a tremendous excitement i think in the diplomatic corps and at the world leader level of people who are excited that president trump and this administration want to engage. there is a lot of times when he's talking to these folks and they're saying, i have not heard from anyone in years. and i think that there is a genuine excitement to reengage the united states, especially in the area of trade and other economic interests, but also in the area of national security.
but when virginia gov. ralph northam (d) weighed in on the controversial virginia measure, he turned the focus from the protection of abortion rights in general to the debate over late-term abortion. annie and ariana report that while abortion opponents routinely try to turn the conversation to late abortions, abortion rights advocates often keep their focus on early, more accepted procedures. the debate about the new bills sought in multiple states proceeded along those lines, until the explosion of attention to northam's comments.
speaking crassly in front of the honor wall at cia headquarters in langley, trump said saturday that the united states should have kept the oil after the liberation of iraq. to the victor belong the spoils, he said. so we should have kept the oil. but, okay, maybe you'll have another chance.
the good news for the biden team is that millions upon millions of people are at home — and for once may be eager to pick up the phone even for a number on caller-id that they do not recognize. they have time to watch biden's events on the computer and time to watch his appearances on sunday shows.
but when you're constantly getting told that can't be true, we doubt that you can do this, this won't happen, and that's the narrative when you turn on television every single day, it's a little frustrating.
question: (inaudible) doing joint military actions with russia in syria.
at the white house: trump meets with chief of staff reince priebus, takes his official portrait, visits the department of homeland security and speaks via telephone with mississippi gov. phil bryan
the purpose of the meeting is to get the president's agenda moving through congress. the american people are frustrated with the lack of progress here in washington and the president wants no delay in addressing our most pressing issues. he's taking every step -- opportunity to forge strong bonds with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. one of the other subjects that's sure to come up is the status of his nominees during this meeting.
what we have seen today is a culmination of a quiet revolution that has been taking place in ireland for the past 10 or 20 years, prime minister leo varadkar said.
spicer: but -- but again, part of it is economic team is gonna look at a multitude of statistics and drive economic policies. his goal is obviously, to get as many americans working together. that's his ultimate goal.
with the benefit of hindsight, it's now undeniable that trump blundered last january and february by turning down democratic offers that would have given him his wall in exchange for protecting the dreamers. trump caved to the hard-liners in his orbit, specifically sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) and nativist policy adviser stephen miller, and demanded massive reductions in the number of legal immigrants. it was a poison pill. but elections have consequences, and democrats now control the house. of course, they won't offer the terms they were willing to when they were in the minority. why would they?
james p. pfiffner is university professor of public policy at the schar school of policy and government at george mason university.
question: if i could just ask one more. you said that the president disagreed with the characterization of a rift with the intelligence community?
until this year the bill wasn't destined to go anywhere, with president donald trump in office and republicans controlling the senate. it will still be hard for democrats to pass partisan legislation this congress, with only 50 democratic senators and vice president harris serving as the tiebreaker.
acp senior vice president robert doherty said acp released its policy framework intentionally for discussion in political debates in the 2020 election cycle, rachel writes. the medical specialty society still envisions a limited potential role for private supplemental insurance in its preferred single-payer model, and supports a public insurance option available to all, including individuals with employer-sponsored insurance.

in ohio, deaths from fentanyl have ravaged vast sections of the state. in 2015, there were 1,255 synthetic-opioid-related deaths, most from fentanyl. by the end of 2017, that number had nearly tripled to 3,572.
for that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. it will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.
currently, when we ship products out of america, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into america, we charge them almost nothing.
many in the republican party argue that simply reducing rates is enough to encourage work and investment, since reduced rates imply that taxpayers can keep more of their income. trump is proposing plenty of reduced rates, bringing them down to 35 percent for rich individual taxpayers and 15 percent for corporations and businesses.
also today, the president signed (ph) designations for acting heads of executive departments and agencies to maintain continuity in those critical positions.
-- but chuck schumer has called on trump to rescind barr's nomination over the nominee's past criticism of the mueller probe. citing a memo barr wrote last year that described mueller's investigation of possible obstruction of justice as fatally misconceived, schumer said on the senate floor, the senate … should subject mr. barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week, and i still believe, after the revelations about mr. barr's unsolicited memo, president trump ought to withdraw this nomination. (politico)
spicer: we did, and at the time that was provided by the inaugural committee came from an outside agency that we reported on. and i think knowing what we know now, we can tell that wmata [washington metropolitan area transit authority] numbers are different, but we were trying to provide numbers that we had been provided. that wasn't like we made them up out of thin air.
five weeks after their last day in office, the trump administration health officials who stayed to the end are now popping up in new roles.
question: if he plans to travel to latin america, given that he left them out of his inauguration speech?
the measure – included by democrats in the sweeping coronavirus legislation they're trying to soon pass – is a key way president biden and democrats are hoping to further expand health coverage, after the 2010 affordable care act made progress toward that end but still fell short of closing the uninsured gap. about 33 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, and more have probably joined their ranks since then amid pandemic-related job losses.
question: thank you, sean. thank you, sean.
we must create a level playing field for american companies and workers.
i think he has a healthy respect for the first amendment and he - you know, this is what makes our country so beautiful, is that on one day you can inaugurate a president, on the next day, people can occupy the same space to protest something. but he's also cognizant to the fact that a lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything. i remember this morning, debbie dingell was on television and she's talking about - let me just, i don't want to inaccurately quote her.
and overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
the poll also notably tested her head-to-head with trump, asking who was doing a better job with shutdown negotiations. forty-seven percent chose pelosi, while just 35 percent chose trump. it also affirmed previous polling that showed the american people blame trump and the republicans for the shutdown by more than a 20-point margin — the kind of margin that has forced republicans to fold during past shutdowns.
-- a russian cybersecurity firm banned from u.s. government networks helped the nsa identify a suspect in the agency's massive 2016 data breach. ellen nakashima reports: federal prosecutors in august 2016 arrested a former nsa contractor, harold t. martin iii, accusing him of taking home without permission at least 50 terabytes of data — the rough equivalent of 500 million pages of material — that included highly sensitive hacking tools. but the nsa's enhanced vigilance was not what led to martin's arrest at his home in glen burnie, md. rather, earlier that month, moscow-based kaspersky lab notified the nsa that it had received strange twitter messages from martin seeking to speak with kaspersky's founder, along with a cryptic comment, 'shelf life, three weeks,' according to two people familiar with the matter.
-- mark morgan, a career fbi official who served as border patrol chief for the last six months of the obama administration before being removed once trump took office, has come out this week in support of a wall. ( colby itkowitz)

trump has misled the public about his approach to patients with preexisting conditions a total of 73 times, our fact checker says. he frequently alleges that republicans — not democrats — are the longtime champions of such protections.
polling from kaiser family foundation released wednesday suggests that medicare-for-all could fall into that trap.
as trump was calling for the death penalty, one of the cities that had a high fentanyl overdose death rate was running out of money to purchase naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. in baltimore, fentanyl deaths had risen by nearly 5,000 percent between 2013 and 2017, and the death toll was continuing to climb.
the opioid epidemic had begun in the late 1990s when a generation of americans became addicted to prescription pain pills. after the government started to crack down on doctors, pain clinics, and drug manufacturers and distributors in the mid-2000s, addicts turned to heroin and then fentanyl.
that -- i don't believe that that has been set up yet because the call was to say -- they did follow up, i'm sorry, two days ago about how to facilitate that call once again. so there have been a total of two calls with the ambassador and general flynn. and the second call came -- i think it's now three days ago -- that was to say once he gets into office, can we set up that call? it hasn't -- to my knowledge, has not occurred yet.
in a normal year, in other words, embracing medicare-for-all might seem like a risky proposition for a democratic primary candidate. but 2020 will not be a normal year.
rarely, but yes. the last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a republican, dick cheney. that 50-50 split ended after six months when a republican senator, jim jeffords of vermont, switched parties, giving democrats a 51-49 advantage. there also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the senate historical office calls the great senate deadlock of 1881.
and pelosi's edge in the shutdown fight was only reinforced as the day went on. early wednesday afternoon, trump made the highly questionable decision of telling pelosi he would deliver the state of the union address next week from the house chamber, even though pelosi has raised shutdown-related objections to it. but pelosi quickly sent a letter back saying she would not extend the invitation, and trump, rather remarkably, immediately backed down. pelosi had called his bluff.
it takes all the pain away, proffit said. you get numb, and you don't feel nothing. that lasts about five hours, and then it starts to wear down, you get cold chills, start cramping up and get sore. and then you have to do it again.
we just never got the president to really give it the firepower and to elevate it, kennedy said in an interview.
this bill would now subsidize health insurance far beyond what was ever imagined when the house and the senate passed the obama health-care law — way beyond the subsidies ever envisioned in that, barrasso said.
the narrative -- and the default narrative is always negative and it's demoralizing. and i think that when you sit here and you realize the sacrifice the guy made, leaving a very, very successful business because he really cares about this country and he wants -- despite your partisan differences, he cares about making this country better for everybody. he wants to make it safer for everybody. and so when you wake up everyday and that's what you're seeing over and over again and you're not seeing stories about the cabinet folks that he's appointing or the success that he's having trying to keep american jobs here. yes, it is a little disappointing.
we're nailing down the final details … and then boning up support between now and then as much as possible, heritage action's dan holler told me last week.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) continued her book tour as she weighs a 2020 bid. from a cnn reporter:
at some point they're going to be looking for a solution, and our goal is to have a solution ready for them, holler said.
-- in an richly reported meditation on the history of walls, marc fisher notes that border walls have a checkered history of maintaining separation between people: no matter how high, how long, how strong the wall, people have an uncanny knack for finding their way over, under and around. … some historians contend that walls have repeatedly proved their worth: they protect communities from perceived threats, bringing the people inside the wall together in security and camaraderie. yet walls can also undermine community, creating and cementing 'us vs. them' antagonisms, letting wall builders avoid resolution of the problems they face.
as we've documented extensively in the health 202 (check out our recent history of preexisting condition protections), trump's administration has taken repeated steps to undermine the aca's ban on insurers from refusing coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or charging them more.
2. a bigger tax cut for the rich
the truth is different. deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide — deaths of despair — hit a new high in 2017. his assaults on obamacare have left 2 million more americans without health coverage, while he's never come close to presenting a comprehensive alternative that would, in fact, meet his promise to provide insurance for everybody.
that was a low point for obama that contributed to a distrust in the executive branch during his presidency, according to polling from gallup. that data is available back to the second term of bill clinton's administration and shows a pattern: clinton, george w. bush and obama all enjoyed general confidence in the executive branch that trump hasn't seen.
the town hall came after constituents, many of them organizing online, made daily calls and sent repeated emails to brat's office to demand a public meeting.
spicer: yeah, i -- i don't know on that one. as i -- i'll have to get back to you on that one. i don't know that we've gotten that far on the list of executive orders, but i'll be glad to get back to you.

it's very stressful for my deputies. they're seeing more death than they've ever seen, said deborah k. burchett, the sheriff of clark county, which had the sixth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. our biggest problem is, our drug addicts also have mental health problems, and all the hospitals have been closed. they all wind up in the jail.

-- money has a funny way of bringing people together: the rival campaign managers for clinton and trump are joining forces on the lucrative paid speaking circuit. robby mook and corey lewandowski will make joint appearances for tens of thousands of dollars per speech before trade associations and the like. their speaking agency promises they will be an entertaining pair sure to keep any audience engaged. it's very this town… (buzzfeed's ruby cramer)
nothing is ever that simple in politics, of course. analysts have attributed the rise of hyperpartisanship and trumpism to a confluence of events. there was the 2008 recession that aggravated polarization on both sides of the aisle. the weakening of campaign finance laws allowed outside groups to spend millions to steer politics in their preferred directions and made politicians dive for safety in the ideological corners of their party. gerrymandering. voters self-sorting into liberals in cities, conservatives in rural areas. mistakes democrats made in the 2016 presidential race.
last year, i repeatedly asked for mr. carroll to testify before us as the acting director of [the drug czar's office], but he refused, cummings said, listing the times carroll had delayed appearing.
because the filings regarding the application for a stay in this matter were not completed until earlier today and the justices need time to review these filings, the decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit is temporarily stayed, justice samuel a. alito jr. wrote.
and i think the president is going to show through deed and action and success that he wants to fight for people's healthcare, he wants to have a better education system, he wants a stronger america, he wants to go in and fix our inner cities, he wants to make sure that our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges. so, i think more than anything, showing people through action and deed and success is where he's going to prove to the american people how much he cares to unite us and how much he cares to make this america better and safer.
-- sen. doug jones (d-ala.) asked the fec to investigate an alleged disinformation campaign by democratic strategists to help him win his 2017 special election. the new york times's alan blinder reports: 'such deceptive tactics have no place in american politics and must be repudiated by those involved in our political system,' mr. jones wrote in a letter to ellen l. weintraub, a democratic member of the commission. neither mr. jones nor his campaign is believed to have known about, much less approved of, any of the deception. mr. jones had quickly pledged to seek an inquiry, but his notarized letter on wednesday … represented his first formal step in support of an investigation by the commission.

the study, by alexander hertel-fernandez of columbia university and matto mildenberger and leah c. stokes of the university of california at santa barbara, found that congressional staffers were terrible at estimating constituents' support for various policies. on nearly every issue surveyed — from gun control to environmental regulation to obamacare — staffers in both parties believed the public was more conservative than they actually are.

* democrats see no need to compromise on tax reform: the new york times reports that democrats are newly emboldened by the gop defeat on health care, and see no need to compromise on further trump proposals, especially tax reform. chuck schumer:
i don't want to give you a timeline, baum replied. but i can tell you this. i've studied the issue very closely.
spicer: well, i think what the president seemed very clear about in foreign policy is too often the united states is going in with a lot of money, a lot of man power, and in many cases, losing both, loss of life -- and we want to make sure that our interests are protected. and so if we're going in to a country for a cause, i think that he wants to make sure that america's getting something out of it for the commitment and the sacrifice that we're making.

more health highlight from the debate:
asked how as a fiscal conservative brat could justify the cost of the wall along the southern border promised by trump — estimated to cost between $15 billion and $25 billion — brat said, the answer is 'easily.'
i mean, you're talking about integrity and you're talking about telling the truth and facts. i don't know that it wasn't malicious at all, and i'm not saying. but there is a point at which we have a right to go out there and correct the record. and i think that over and over again, there is this attempt to go after this president and say, well, that can't be true and that's not right and the numbers weren't there.
8. sessions refusing to recuse himself:
america has spent approximately $6 trillion in the middle east, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. with this $6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country — twice. and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.

it has instructed epa officials to freeze all grants and contracts, a move that could affect everything from state-led climate research to localized efforts to improve air and water quality to environmental justice projects aimed at helping poor communities. each year the epa awards more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements. for now, it appears, that funding is on hold, casting a cloud of uncertainty over one of the agency's core functions, as well as over the scientists, state and local officials, universities and native american tribes that often benefit from the grants, brady and juliet report.
the house energy and commerce health subcommittee holds a hearing on the trump administration's family separation policy on thursday.
the post's editorial board says the senate should not confirm sessions until he agrees to such a recusal: mr. trump has tapped rod j. rosenstein, a respected career prosecutor, to be deputy attorney general. mr. sessions should have no qualms about entrusting him with these politically vexing issues. it would raise confidence in his justice department and save him plenty of headaches.
some of the administration's actions are lamentable but unsurprising; they embody the deregulatory instincts of any republican administration, even if they at times have a more radical, deeply destructive, edge. others, particularly in the arena of immigration, are uniquely, repulsively trumpian.
spicer: hold on, i'll get to you. i promise.
and i think that we are -- and so, you see this historic thing. and he stands there at the capitol and i was not that close but, you know, on the platform, and you look out and all your -- it's an amazing view. and it's just so many people who got in long lines, who had to go around all this different stuff to get in. and that was for the first time that we did have to go through fencing that far out.
my administration wants to work with members in both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
democratic campaign officials say the dual threats to public health and the economy have upended an election they worried — and republicans hoped — would focus on trump's impeachment, politico's sarah ferris and ally mutnick report. campaigning has all but ceased in the traditional sense: fundraising is down, and campaign officials on both sides say they're being more careful about when and how to attack their opponents.
the state of the union historically has been a platform for presidents to make bold public health proclamations — many of which haven't come to pass. former president barack obama used his final address in january 2016 to call for an end to cancer, dan writes. the strategy was heavily shaped by [cdc director robert redfield], a prominent aids researcher who was tapped to lead the cdc last year.
the cdc's new guidance is part of the agency's latest recommendations for distributing the three approved coronavirus vaccines, the post's lena h. sun reports. the health agency urged states to consider the unique needs of people with disabilities or cognitive decline and their caretakers, and those with limited access to technology, as appointments open to new groups.
and i think that it's important to understand, that whether it's the president himself, the vice president, the senior team, the volunteers or the people who are out there just in america that voted for him or walked the streets or put up a sign, that to constantly be told no, no, no and watch him go yes, yes, yes every time and to come up to the next hurdle and see someone put a block up gets a little frustrating.
he did not vent or rage. instead in the oval office afterward trump was sullen and quiet as he contemplated his first blow, dealt by the washington swamp he had vowed to drain, one insider source said. the president was well aware he failed to deliver on an issue that stirs the passions of his political base. he was also mindful that the health care disaster would make his quest to tackle a behemoth tax package that much more difficult, the source said.

question: so the people in the -- the front who were seen on camera, those were cia employees?
-- trump's handling of the shutdown has demonstrated how white house communications director bill shine is not directing the messaging coming out of the west wing. the new york times's katie rogers and maggie haberman report: an alumnus of fox news, where he was known as a protector of the network's chairman, roger e. ailes, mr. shine has confined his white house role mainly to stagecraft, people who have worked with him say, and mr. trump, who chafes against being managed, has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done. once he was back in washington, mr. shine was among the aides pushing mr. trump to deliver tuesday's prime-time oval office speech and make a visit to the border on thursday. and it was mr. shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when mr. trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech. … to his friends and allies, mr. trump wistfully brings up hope hicks, his most successful communications director, who departed nearly a year ago.
spicer: their expectation should be that he's going to stand up and value life, born or unborn. same as he said throughout the last year and half, that he's going to stand up and protect life, promote it, and instill policies that promote life, that promote adoption, that help support young women, that help support funding of - of agencies and clinics that support women's health.
spicer: i'm not gonna get in front of the president's executive actions, but i will tell you that areas like dakota and the keystone pipeline, areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into america's energy supply more, that's something that he has been very clear about. i think he talked about it, not only on the campaign, but around the thanksgiving period. he was talking about that being a big priority. that's one of those ones where i think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where i think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to america's benefit. it's good for economic growth, it's good for jobs, and it's good for american energy.
we used the national archives' executive orders disposition tables to determine how many executive orders were explicitly revoked or superseded by each of the 12 presidents who have served since franklin d. roosevelt. we counted reversals within newly elected presidents' first 30 days in office. that count was quite low. nine presidents reversed three or fewer in that time; obama hit the high, reversing eight previous presidents' executive orders within 30 days.
as promised, i directed the department of defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy isis — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered muslims and christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and beliefs. we will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.
kettl aptly describes why federalism was unavoidable when the constitution was written in 1787. many states did not agree with the draft mission statement for the united states that thomas jefferson had laid out in the preamble to the declaration of independence. liberty and self-government might have passed muster if properly defined, but the assertion that all men are created equal, with inherent rights, would be mocked by generations of southern slaveholders. representatives from south carolina and georgia refused to support the declaration until a passage condemning the slave trade as cruel war against human nature itself was removed.
spicer: no, it's not, and sometimes we'll make mistakes. i promise you that. but it's not always got to be negative, jim. some days, we do do the right thing. some days we are successful. so it's not -- part of us is saying, when we're right, say we're right. when we're wrong, say we're wrong. but it's not always wrong and negative. there are things -- there's a lot of things that he's done already, a lot of amazing people that he's appointed, a lot of success that he's having.
several people sported stickers on their clothes bearing their zip codes, to demonstrate they lived in brat's congressional district.
-- even mike huckabee, whose daughter is spicer's principal deputy, gently chastised trump. but he can do so because he's not running for anything. i have no evidence whatsoever, and i don't know that anyone does, that there were that many illegal people who voted, and frankly it doesn't matter, huckabee said in an interview on fox business network. he's the president and whether 20 million people voted, it doesn't matter anymore. he's the president, and i'm not sure why he brought it up.
over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million americans are on food stamps.

what other threat that is preventable is going to kill tens of thousands of americans? walters said. we're spending much more money on terrorism, as we should, but we're not spending a similar amount on the source of death to many more americans right now.
our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. it is american leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.
it's really pretty simple. the senate bill would, over the course of the next decade, cut obamacare's health insurance subsidies by $408 billion and medicaid by $772 billion all to pay for $700 billion of tax cuts, nearly half of which the nonpartisan tax policy center says would go to the top 1 percent of households. not only that, but the fact that it would only peg the value of its remaining subsidies to higher-deductible plans means that a lot of people would be pushed into them. they couldn't afford anything else. on an apples-to-apples basis, the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation estimates that the senate bill would increase the cost of a silver plan that covers 70 percent of expected medical costs by an average of 74 percent over the next three years — and more for the type of older, poorer people who overwhelmingly went for trump.
the daily show trolled trump with this 2004 video of him delivering a commencement address at new york's wagner college:
he overdosed four times but kept using.
for trump's people — the working-class voters who backed a bumptious billionaire who they hoped would shake up things as their champion — the betrayal is clear and specific. many of these americans voted for trump in 2016 despite thinking he was unfit for office. they knew he was a scoundrel, but they hoped he would be their scoundrel. as he nears the end of his first term, it is increasingly clear that they voted for a con man without realizing they were the mark.
he appreciates the ideas and opinions that come -- that come through the oval office or small groups, where he gets to share their prospective and their ideas and their opinions. i think that's what he's gonna continue to do later this afternoon.
— meanwhile, northam faces calls for his resignation over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. the tip to the reporter who exposed the photo on northam's yearbook page appears to have come from a medical school classmate or classmates of the governor's who were concerned following the abortion controversy in the state last week, our post colleague paul farhi reports.
he might have added that if someone is addicted to drugs and cannot find treatment, or working two jobs but missing their kids' lives, or commuting for hours because housing prices are too high and public transportation is not available, that person is not very free, either.

when he was done: cheers. then it was on to the stump speech. he's going to repeal every word of obamacare and every illegal and unconstitutional executive action of obama., abolish the department of education and change the tax system so people can file their taxes on a postcard. cruz stood in the middle of a group of tables. a little girl waved to him much of the time. the two later talked about their birthdays.
if ever there was a time to reexamine madison's invention, this would seem to be it.
jerry moran ( kan. ) moran has said he supports reapeal obamacare now, replace later. it's not clear if that will be a vote on tuesday.there are serious problems with obamacare, and my goal remains what it has been for a long time: to repeal and replace it, he said in a statement july 17. this closed-door process has yielded the bcra, which fails to repeal the affordable care act or address healthcare's rising costs. for the same reasons i could not support the previous version of this bill, i cannot support this one. read more »

i've said from day one that i want to get to yes, cruz said. the consequences would be terrible to fail. yet cruz also promised not to pass a watered-down bill: even worse than not passing a bill is passing a bill that makes the problems worse.
in his dec. 27 op-ed, my new year's wish for trump: respect the haters, too, gary abernathy demonstrated the vacuity of the reasons for the continued support of president trump. he wrote, i want trump to continue to 'drain the swamp,' enforce immigration laws, undo obamacare, cut costly regulation, put america first and even criticize journalists when their zeal to be the first to break unfavorable news about him results in inaccurate or poorly vetted stories. mr. abernathy expounded empty slogans, not material policies, slogans that ignite the amygdala of the human brain rather than stimulate the reasoning functions of the frontal lobe.
republican-controlled states say that when congress voided the penalty for not having insurance, all of obamacare was rendered unconstitutional. the trump administration sided with those states. the supreme court heard arguments shortly after trump's third court nominee, amy coney barrett, took her seat as an associate justice. while republicans were banking on the court's 6-3 conservative majority, chief justice john roberts and associate justice brett kavanaugh signaled during the november oral arguments they are inclined to uphold the bulk of the law even if individual mandate is struck down. a ruling is likely by june.
the secretary of state arrived in cairo:
tax loopholes. prescription drug pricing. financial rules. environmental protection. these companies define policies that are great for their bottom line, while good, honest people who work hard get squeezed harder every year. it's corruption, pure and simple.
in the early 1990s, house leader newt gingrich (r-ga.) doubled down on a rhetoric of radicalism and extremism. he promised revolution and described political opponents as the embodiment of evil, who won only because they lied and cheated. e.j. dionne jr. has described the toxic results of this strategy as the politics of disappointment and betrayal.
i have ordered the department of homeland security to create an office to serve american victims. the office is called voice –- victims of immigration crime engagement. we are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
christie had told trump that his administration was inheriting an out-of-control opioid epidemic that blew up with the arrival of fentanyl during the obama administration — between 2013 and 2017, more than 67,000 people died from the synthetic drug.
ahh: president trump has nominated his former doctor rear adm. ronny l. jackson to be promoted to two-star admiral and to be his chief medical adviser.

trump's assistant secretary for health, adm. brett p. giroir, said if medicaid is cut and the aca is declared unconstitutional, those programs would have to be replaced so tens of thousands would not be left without coverage.

the rejection of the gop plan is an important historical marker in our interminable health-care debate. the american people were presented with the first genuine effort at a gop consensus ideological alternative to obamacare — one that would do away with the aca's effort to guarantee free or affordable coverage through government spending and regulations — and decided they preferred sticking with the latter. the quinnipiac poll also found that 51 percent oppose repeal and 61 percent disapprove of trump's handling of the issue. as jonathan cohn puts it, the aca has shifted the expectations of what government should do ― and of what a decent society looks like. there are zero indications that trump and gop leaders are capable of acknowledging this possibility.

but the vice president's statement directly contradicts with a comment by fauci. we certainly are not starting from scratch, fauci said during a white house press briefing last month.
tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of black history month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. recent threats targeting jewish community centers and vandalism of jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in kansas city, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.
above all else, we will keep our promises to the american people.

attorney general nominee jeff sessions won't commit to recusing himself from potential justice department investigations into controversies involving trump — from russia to business conflicts of interest — despite his vigorous campaigning on behalf of trump during the 2016 election season, politico's seung min kim reports. in written responses to members of the senate judiciary committee, sessions said repeatedly that he is 'not aware of a basis to recuse myself' from issues surrounding trump such as potential violations of the emoluments clause, a constitutional ban on officials accepting payments from foreign governments. that differs from sessions' vow to recuse himself from any ongoing issues involving the federal probe into clinton's use of a private email server. sessions said during his confirmation hearing that he would step aside from any such investigations because his political rhetoric against clinton during the campaign 'could place my objectivity in question.
progressive lawmakers such as warren (d) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of congress and the business interests who lobby them. last year, a study published in the american political science review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed congress's perception of what the american public wants.
asked what they would like to see the house majority that swept into power in the 2018 midterms do, most democrats picked bolstering obamacare over passing medicare-for-all.
some economists worry about a death spiral of rising costs in the absence of a mechanism, like the individual mandate, that forces healthy americans to get covered, since healthier people buying coverage keeps costs down for sick people. that's one issue. another is the limited coverage options available to americans in rural and remote parts of the country. and in the mostly republican-led states where elected leaders have declined to expand medicaid eligibility, many residents fall in a coverage gap, earning just enough income that they don't qualify for subsidies.
our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the united states. we are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical islamic terrorism.
trump's defenders argue that his statements, whether off the cuff at rallies or in his scripted acceptance address at last week's republican convention, are not policy prescriptions but rather reflections of popular frustration. when trump says he's going to fix a problem immediately, some supporters say, he's throwing down his marker, taking a stand rather than spelling out a plan.
conway agreed and said the administration is making important strides.
-- contrary to trump's rhetoric in his immigration address, apprehensions at the border are relatively low compared with past points in recent u.s. history. from brittany renee mayes, aaron williams and laris karklis: u.s. border patrol took just over 400,000 people illegally entering the united states into custody in 2018, down from the second-high of 1.67 million in 2000. the washington post fact checker salvador rizzo reported that most of these declines have come, 'partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers.'
the new effort is a recognition that, while they lack the power of the presidency and the megaphone that comes from the white house briefing room, the campaign needs to try something to stand out, matt writes.
-- the new york times corrected a story we included in yesterday's 202: a previous version of this article misidentified the people to whom paul manafort wanted a russian associate to send polling data. mr. manafort wanted the data sent to two ukrainian oligarchs, serhiy lyovochkin and rinat akhmetov, not to oleg v. deripaska, a russian oligarch close to the kremlin.
in all, trump has so far proposed minor changes to his plan from the campaign. the tax policy center forecast that 51 percent of the benefits from that plan would eventually accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.
but our partners must meet their financial obligations.

obama administration officials were slow to address the fentanyl epidemic. the administration saw fentanyl as an add-on to the overall opioid crisis, rather than a singular danger that required a strategy of its own because it was so deadly and was coming into the country largely unimpeded through the mail. senior white house and justice department officials, motivated by a desire to rectify racial inequality in sentencing, emphasized drug treatment over incarceration, and drug prosecutions fell off as fentanyl coursed through sections of the country.
there is a growing sense that the special counsel's closely held investigation could come to culmination soon. some trump advisers think mueller could deliver the confidential report explaining his findings to senior justice department officials next month. under the rules authorizing the special counsel, the attorney general can then decide whether to share the report or parts of it with congress and the public. some house leaders have vowed to immediately seek to obtain a copy of mueller's findings. but the white house would resist the release of details describing confidential and sensitive communications between the president and his senior aides, trump advisers say. it is unclear whether the special counsel's report will refer to material that the white house views as privileged communications obtained from interviews with senior white house officials. some trump advisers anticipate that mueller may simply write a concise memo laying out his conclusions about the president's actions.
question: is it your intention to always tell the truth from that podium, and will you pledge never to knowingly something that is not factual?
the following year, the administration took an even deeper stance against the aca, saying it believes the entire law must be toppled now that the penalty for lacking coverage is gone.
— president trump predicted obamacare will be terminated, suggesting the lawsuit brought by texas and other republican-led states to overturn the health-care law will eventually be successful.
we shouldn't extrapolate too much from the first three weeks of pelosi's speakership, but if anything it seems having a long-unpopular and volatile president as her own foil could play to pelosi's strengths. what people forget about pelosi, given her years featured in gop attack ads, is that she was relatively popular when she had this setup before. she first became speaker after the 2006 election and served in that role for the last two years of the george w. bush administration. her poll numbers only took a turn for the negative when barack obama and obamacare came along.
the group might be aiming for an unrealistic goal in enacting its plan, despite the gop majorities in congress and a republican president.
the party needs to do something, holler said. it's not entirely their fault, [but] they have no answer to it. the left is sort of extraordinarily motivated, and the republican base is demoralized.

mike lee ( utah ) lee opposed the second version of the bill because he supported full repeal instead. it's not clear if there will be a vote on full repeal tuesday. he said in a july 17 statement of the second version of senate republicans' bill: after conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the consumer freedom amendment, i have decided i cannot support the current version of the better care reconciliation act. in addition to not repealing all of the obamacare taxes, it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly obamacare regulations. read more »

there's a reason, after all, why republicans couldn't manage to repeal the law in 2017, despite controlling both the house and the senate — the law benefited too many voters by that point.

when trump won, some congressional democrats said they didn't think his election was legitimate because of russian interference. some objected to his electoral college win in 2016 (though no senators joined in, and not in nearly the numbers that republicans opposed biden's). many, if not most republicans, thought impeaching trump last year for his actions in ukraine was opportunistic and unnecessary.
and when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of american greatness began.
in fact, as gallup reported wednesday, the number of uninsured americans has increased during trump's time in office, from a low at the end of barack obama's second term in office — a function of the implementation of the affordable care act (known more generally as obamacare). the attitude of trump's administration toward obamacare has varied from indifferent to overtly hostile.
paul has said he hopes he can make the bill more acceptable, even as others have predicted he will vote no. but he has also suggested a fallback plan of voting strictly on repeal. lee has not said publicly what he will do, though there is not a high level of confidence among capitol hill republicans that he will ultimately vote yes.
he's done good things as president: this is the most frequent defense we've heard. trump has been a means to many ends they wanted to reach: a conservative judicial branch, including a very conservative supreme court; tax reform; deregulation across the government; weakening obamacare.

wouldn't you think that when the white house changed parties — when a republican took over after a democrat, or vice versa — the new occupant would reverse more executive orders? it's not so. interestingly, the annual average of reversals didn't differ much after party turnover transitions (7.8 percent) or party continuity transitions (7.1 percent). nor do presidential reversals vary much by party: republicans revoked roughly seven orders on average, democrats eight. that may be because most executive orders are routine and administrative.
the republican argument, which eventually gained traction with readers and viewers, held that private enterprise knew what was best and should be left to its own devices. executives and their allies in elective office advanced climate change skepticism in the service of environmental deregulation; during george w. bush's presidency, they advocated partial privatization of social security; they defended the right of bake shops to decline customers ordering same-sex wedding cakes; they argued successfully on behalf of companies like hobby lobby declining to pay for employees' contraceptive care under obamacare; they battled the nebulous foe of political correctness, labeling those on the left as snowflakes for favoring, in their view, restrictions, not freedom, in the domain of political speech.

ahh: rates of opioid abuse declined in younger generations between 2002 and 2014, but they've doubled among americans over 50, our colleague joe davidson writes. unwittingly, medicare compounds the epidemic by funding needed opioids that can be abused, but, generally, not funding the care and medicines needed to fight opioid addiction, joe writes. many elderly get hooked on opiates through prescriptions, rather than street drugs like heroin.
can you clarify that? and generally, is the president open to joint action in syria with the russians?
the draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of c.i.a. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now barred by statute, charlie notes. but it sets up high-level policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to mr. trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a 'hell of a lot worse' — not only because 'torture works,' but because even 'if it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway.'

yet the cost is more per person than the government spends to insure people through its major insurance programs, medicare and medicaid — and illustrates just how expensive it is to rely on the nation's for-profit insurance industry to get americans covered.
lee argued that presidents will continue to assume broader powers unless congress fulfills its constitutional duty to protect the american people from exactly the kind of arbitrary, unaccountable government-without-consent that congress now for its own selfish reasons enables the executive branch to practice.
he's gonna figure out where we can expand u.s. market access. and that's i think, what today's decision really starts to show. is that it's not about multilateral agreements under a trump administration. it's about bilateral agreements, where we can figure out country to country, how can we fight for the american worker, gain them access to another market that's gonna benefit our large and small businesses who want to sell additional goods and services.

hot on the left: texas radio station bans madonna in the name of 'patriotism' after women's march, from huffpost: a texarkana, texas, radio station is venting its frustration over madonna's passionate women's march speech through its playlist. the station, hits 105, stated that it will no longer play the pop icon's tracks as of tuesday, three days after demonstrations in washington, d.c., and around the world attracted millions of supporters. a statement posted to facebook cited the 'f-bombs' in her speech' along with the singer's comments on 'how upset the election results had made her.' 'banning all madonna songs at hits 105 is not a matter of politics, it's a matter of patriotism,' the station's manager said in a statement. 'it just feels wrong to [be] … paying her royalties when the artist has shown un-american sentiments. if all stations playing madonna took their lead from us, that would send a powerful economic message to madonna.' hot on the right: gold star family members say they were assaulted during inaugural ball festivities, from fox news: a massive group of violent demonstrators spat on, assaulted and screamed obscenities at a gold star widow and sister friday outside an inaugural ball honoring the military, one of the women told 'fox & friends' on tuesday.

-- some landowners along the border are gearing up to fight the government's planned construction of the wall. the ap's nomaan merchant reports: congress in march funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in texas. the government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the rio grande valley. those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel. many have hired lawyers who are preparing to fight the government if, as expected, it moves to seize their land through eminent domain.
no one knows how seriously to take trump's threat to seize iraq's oil: the recycled campaign comment is raising concerns about trump's understanding of the delicate middle east politics involved in the u.s.-led effort against extremist groups, the ap reports in a story that just moved over the wire. the statement ignores the precedent of hundreds of years of american history.… taking the oil would also require a permanent u.s. occupation, or at least until iraq's 140 billion barrels of crude run out, and a large presence of american soldiers to guard sometimes isolated oil fields and infrastructure. such a mission would be highly unpopular with iraqis, whose hearts and minds the u.s. is still trying to win to defeat groups such as [the islamic state and al-qaeda].

there's no reason for the national archives to ever digitally alter a historic photograph, rice university historian douglas brinkley said. if they don't want to use a specific image, then don't use it. but to confuse the public is reprehensible. the head of the archives has to very quickly fix this damage. a lot of history is messy, and there's zero reason why the archives can't be upfront about a photo from a women's march.
third, the democrats' best argument in 2018 was health care. now that we are in a health-care epidemic not seen for 100 years, democrats have an obvious upper hand. unbelievably, republicans will not drop their lawsuit seeking to invalidate all of obamacare. in addition, on tuesday, politico reported, the trump administration has decided against reopening obamacare enrollment to uninsured americans during the coronavirus pandemic, defying calls from health insurers and democrats to create a special sign-up window amid the health crisis. this is horrifyingly cruel and politically shortsighted. republicans however seem determined to be on the side of taking away or denying health-care coverage to millions of americans. this is a gift to the biden team.

the mood of the negotiations is not very upbeat, said republicans familiar with the talks. mcconnell has presented ideas in closed sessions and has closely guarded the senate's plans in the hope that they will not leak to critics or the media. hatch struggled to project confidence about the process this week as he betrayed concerns. there's a difference between optimism about passage and optimism about getting it all put together the right way, hatch said, noting that senators have a lot to work through.

'over 100 contacts is really significant because you don't just have 100 contacts with a foreign power if there's nothing going on there.' … dessel noted the group's list of contacts is on the 'conservative' end and the 'very minimum amount of contacts' between russian-linked officials and those within the trump campaign and transition.

an executive order he issued will create a special enrollment period for plans sold in the federal healthcare.gov market from feb. 15 to may 15, offering a path to health care for people who find themselves without insurance coverage after losing their jobs. the order also directs agencies to look for ways to strengthen medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people, and obamacare more broadly. he could also take other administrative actions, like restoring funding for navigators and reversing trump administration guidance letting states waive certain obamacare rules.

the american civil liberties union first brought the case over president donald trump's 'zero tolerance' policy of criminally prosecuting all border crossers, which led to the separation of hundreds of families and sparked national outrage. sabraw had ordered the administration to find and reunite separated families, they write. trump officially halted the practice with an executive order on june 20, 2018. but the aclu claimed in court that since then, the government has continued the practice and separated more than 1,000 families in violation of sabraw's order.
that torch is now in our hands. and we will use it to light up the world. i am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
in 2014, obama announced a prisoner swap in which army sgt. bowe bergdahl was brought home from afghanistan in exchange for five taliban commanders who had been held at the u.s. facility at guantanamo bay, cuba. congress had passed a law requiring the president to notify it 30 days before the release of any guantanamo detainee, but obama insisted he had a higher duty to protect american lives and u.s. soldiers.
buttigieg — like sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) — is comfortable talking about faith in the context of his public views. warren likes to quote matthew 25 ('i was hungry and you gave me food. i was thirsty and you gave me water, i was in prison and you visited me. naked and you clothed me. and as much as you have done it to one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.') buttigieg says, living your faith might also have to do with paying more attention to those most in need and not celebrating those who already have the most wealth and the most power.
a question about trump's chicago tweet:
we want peace, wherever peace can be found. america is friends today with former enemies. some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these world wars. this history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
and 62 percent of legislative staffers said they would view letters from employees of a hypothetical large company in their district as representative of public opinion, versus 32 percent who said the same about letters from ordinary constituents not identifying any business affiliation. perhaps most strikingly, 1 in 10 staffers told the researchers letters from ordinary citizens were not at all representative of public opinion in their districts.
that theory might have had it backward.
our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.
their names are jamiel shaw, susan oliver, jenna oliver, and jessica davis.
what's more, while house conservatives did kill the gop bill, it's important that many moderate republicans — senators, governors and even some in the house — opposed the plan precisely because it would take coverage from lower-income people. indeed, we've now learned that there may be a hidden majority in both houses of congress (democrats plus moderate republicans) behind leaving in place the type of spending and regulations (with the exception of the mandate) that broadly make up obamacare. the genuine moderate republican opposition to such cruelly regressive policy is a pleasant surprise.
some of the loudest jeers came over republicans' promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act as people held up red cards signaling their discontent.
and we are all made by the same god.
question: and do you stand by your statement that was the most watched inaugural --
you have to be able to explain in a tweet, said a cruz associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe strategy.
the national institutes of health issued an email to its institute and center directors informing them they should not communicate on public forums and with public officials on new or pending regulation, policy or guidance that is under review.
the west calumet housing complex was built in 1972 atop a former lead smelting plant. even after the environmental protection agency discovered high levels of lead in 1985, hud's indianapolis field office did not conduct the required environmental reviews, according to the report.
on march 29, 2017, two months after his inauguration, trump invited then-new jersey gov. chris christie to the white house.
the united kingdom will infect healthy volunteers in the world's first coronavirus challenge trial, the post's karla adam reports. the effort is aimed at accelerating scientific understanding of vaccines and treatments, but some have questioned whether the move is necessary given the rapid authorization and rollout of highly effective vaccines.

with the help of prime minister justin trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
university of texas professor donald f. kettl takes up this task in his new book, the divided states of america. he seeks to show how we got to this impasse and presents an argument for how federalism itself could be the instrument of our salvation. kettl offers a clear and cogent exposition of the problem, but his answer to it, a hamiltonian solution to madison's great dilemma, is little developed.
a republican senator expressed her view on the pointlessness of the shutdown:
of course, this reflects tax returns, not people. we cannot assume that 5 million taxpayers represent just 5 million people, so we cannot easily make an apples-to-apples comparison. but let's give it a shot.
between the subsidies the people are getting, the continued strong enrollment, generally, and the fact we haven't seen a significant drop off in the young adult age range -- those are the signs we're not really seeing a death spiral yet, cox said.
but marino's nomination quickly fell apart. a joint investigation by the post and 60 minutes disclosed that marino had close ties to the opioid industry. the investigation found that the congressman had sponsored legislation that made it harder for the dea to penalize drug distributors and manufacturers when they failed to report suspicious orders and shipments of narcotics.
question: first of all, congratulations and thanks for taking my question. getting back to saturday at the cia and your statement here at the podium. why make this crowd side issue -- or crowd size issue something to talk about at all? i mean, why get into it? did it bother the president that much that he felt that you needed to come out here and straighten that out for us? and why did he choose the cia as the venue to talk about that?
while the trump administration has made the opioid epidemic a priority, people in communities across the country continue to die in record numbers from fentanyl, and health officials are struggling to provide treatment for tens of thousands more, like the men and women warehoused inside this jail.
now the database shows trump made 8,155 suspect claims in 2019, up from 5,689 claims in 2018 and 1,999 claims in the first year of his presidency.
democrats can celebrate, but they cannot be complacent. they will have to expose and fight any efforts by the trump administration to sabotage the affordable care act through regulation. they should propose a package of improvements to make the aca work better and dare trump — and the dozen or so non-right-wing republicans who helped block the trump-ryan bill — to join them.
to any in congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, i would ask you this question: what would you say to the american family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because america refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?
police and sheriffs are members of our community. they are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
of course, this is essentially the same idea as offering a government public option plan on the marketplaces — an idea democrats tried to advance as part of the aca but eventually abandoned after strong opposition from republicans.
spicer: right, but i'm saying that -- so there's a reason that we put out several versions of that. one is that it -- the illustrative nature of -- of how you count the unemployed, whether or not they're long term unemployed or whether or not they're still seeking a job.
research shows that inequality breeds distrust in government, kettl notes, which decreases electoral participation and compliance with tax collection while increasing political polarization and corruption. it is expensive, since more distrust leads to more regulation and litigation, he writes. combined with the erosion of madison's other great invention, the separation of powers, the republic has created a crisis it may well not be able to survive.
-- trump appears more concerned about losing his base than most people understand. he's not acting like someone who thinks he could get away with shooting a person on fifth avenue and have his core supporters stick with him. he admitted as much during a moment of candor with reporters at the white house yesterday: right now, if i did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me are my senators. they'd be angry at me, he said. the second ones would be the house. and the third ones would be, frankly, my base and a lot of republicans out there.
former trump administration officials said the white house did not trust the career staffers at the office. one former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the president and his aides wanted to transcend the drug czar and raise the issue to a higher level.
no stump speech here — cruz had a chat with james dobson, the founder of focus on the family and cruz surrogate. he discussed his faith and quoted the bible; he asked people to pray for his children. the ceiling leaked. cruz said if hillary clinton is elected the supreme court will rule that no american has the right to bear arms and the government could make firearm ownership a felony. a man in the back yells: come and take it!
every day approximately 11 ohioans die from unintended drug overdoses, sen. rob portman (r-ohio) said in a statement. this crisis is overwhelming ohio and our country. the funding in this proposal would be another important step in the fight against this epidemic.
andrew yang: sure. so none of you had heard of me eight, 10 months ago, i'd imagine. and i'm sitting here having outperformed half a dozen sitting senators, governors, members of congress. and so you have to ask yourself, how did that happen? and it happened because i'm laser-focused on the real problems that americans see around us every day, many of which led directly to donald trump being elected. right now, i'm fifth in the polls, rising, fastest-growing candidate or campaign in the race.
the data points again to six companies that distributed the majority of the pain pills -- mckesson corp., cardinal health, walgreens, amerisourcebergen, cvs and walmart made up 76 percent of the oxycodone and hydrocodone pills shipped during those years. the volume of pills distributed skyrocketed as the epidemic claimed more lives. from 2006 through 2014, more than 130,000 americans died from prescription opioids, steven, scott and sari write. the number of pills shipped went from 8.4 billion in 2006 to 12.8 billion in 2011. pill distribution started to decline slightly in 2012, and the additional data shows that, by 2014, the number of pills distributed was 11.8 billion.
whitney millay, second from right, heads into a residential recovery facility in washington court house, the only one for women in fayette county, in april. she says she overdosed 10 times on fentanyl. it was a fine line between oblivion and death, millay says.
but since the tax cut's passage, the trend has been in the other direction. when sen. bernie sanders of vermont...introduced his universal medicare bill last year, he did not immediately say how it would be paid for, dave and jeff note. he had offered a list of potential tax hikes to pay for it but didn't include them in the bill. and in a new ad for her reelection campaign, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), who is facing a challenge this year from her own party, tells california's primary voters that she favors a health care 'public option' and the expansion of medicare to people 55 and older, with no suggestion of how it would be paid for.
the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.
democrats can't afford to lose a single vote.
watch virginia gov. ralph northam's full press conference addressing the controversy surrounding his 1984 medical school yearbook:
question: -- the right thing to do, to repeal tpp?
serious republicans like bob gates and john mccain chortle at the idea:
many voices on the right seem to have abandoned the idea that the marketplace can be trusted to sort itself out. in response to the de-platforming of parler, podcaster buck sexton decried big tech censorship, missing the irony that parler, a private entity, was effectively shut down by other private entities — and that sexton retained a platform to issue his critique of big tech via twitter.
spicer: what regulations are stopping you from conducting more business? what are the ways that we can give you more market access into other countries around the globe? and i think that's what his focus is going to continue to be, is how do we create a tax and regulatory environment that grows the economy and benefits the american working? so it's not just about creating more jobs but it's also about lifting up those job through higher wages.

6. who is key to keeping the 50 senate democrats together?
not at this time, she testified.
question: social security and infrastructure. on social security, the president will be meeting tonight with congressional leaders. what's he going to do given his campaign promise on not touching social security when paul ryan and mitch mcconnell send him a bill that declaims (ph) in a funding package various cuts in social security. and on infrastructure, has it fallen off the radar screen, or is it going to be -- stay a priority for the president? spicer: so on social security, he's going to have to talk to them, i think he's been very clear with his priority is in terms of preserving and protecting this really important benefit to our seniors. he understands -- i mean, the -- mr. trump's employed so many people over the years, he understands the struggle that people have later in life to continue to make ends meet and i think that he is keenly aware of how important this program is to so many people in their later years. and so he's going to continue to fight to make sure that that's a program that is preserved and protected.
as noted above, democrats will have leverage in this scenario.
on may 12 that year, in one of his first actions, sessions reversed what had become known as the holder memo. the 2013 document written by then-attorney general eric h. holder jr. directed federal prosecutors to stop pursuing low-level, nonviolent drug charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences. over decades, u.s. drug policy had resulted in long prison terms and increased incarceration for first-time offenders, most of them young black men, and holder wanted to reverse what he saw as a historic injustice.
matthew fiedler, a fellow at the brookings institution who suggested this approach, said that this comparison was probably too generous to mulvaney for several reasons.
* schumer says trump will have to ditch the right: on abc's this week, democratic leader chuck schumer laid down the conditions for democratic cooperation with trump on health care:
last year, heritage and other conservative activists criticized most of the proposed republican-led health-care bills for leaving too much of the aca in place — and called for even more dramatic shifts in how the government's medicaid program fo low-income americans works.
those close to cruz say his willingness to negotiate with gop leaders is born in part out of political necessity. mica mosbacher, a fundraiser for cruz's presidential campaign, said cruz was at risk of losing support from benefactors who worried about his combative posture.
— and here are a few more good reads:
a house republican explained his awkward reaction to his democratic colleagues' applause for their funding bills:
[republicans are facing the ire of the anti-trump movement this week. will it last?]
this is a priority for the president, carroll said in an interview.
4. trump's claims around patients with preexisting health conditions (including one that glenn gave four pinocchios) have attracted the most ire from democrats. that's because it was they who first passed such protections within obamacare — the law trump tried initially to repeal and subsequently modified through regulatory action.
so, do i think he has a mandate? sure. but it's not just -- it's not about -- it's not on this issue, i think that all leaders have a mandate for the american people, to fix this system and make it better.
a majority of these patients will be over age 65, so the federal medicare program will pay their bills, which are typically around half or two-thirds of what commercial insurers pay. low-income people on medicaid will have coverage, too.
the dropouts are primarily people with incomes too high to qualify for aca subsidies. that is the group iowa officials expect to be attracted to the new coverage, which is why ommen predicts it will not undercut the marketplace.
this idea — aimed at addressing persistent affordability concerns among middle-income earners — was a mainstay of biden's health-care plan during the campaign. it's also included in the coronavirus relief package congress is working to pass.
trump's choice for health secretary repeatedly refused during his own testy confirmation hearing to promise that no americans will be worse off under trump's executive order to ease provisions of the affordable care act. democrats targeted most of their questioning on the direction that tom price, if confirmed, would try to take the health-care system. price demurred repeatedly. for instance, he sidestepped a series of questions about the effects of the sweeping order trump issued just hours after his swearing-in that directed agencies to lift or soften federal rules implementing aspects of the aca. price declined to commit that no one would be harmed, that no one would lose insurance coverage or that the regulations would be rewritten only after a plan exists to replace the 2010 health-care law. (read the full write-up by amy goldstein and juliet eilperin.)
some americans will certainly assume that if trump is leveraging the heft of an oval office address, it is in service of something that deserves that attention, this undeniable crisis in pence's formulation (that became urgent only after trump changed his mind about agreeing to a funding deal when he saw conservative media expressing frustration about his not picking a fight over the border wall). it's worth remembering, though, that trump has a long track record of making false claims to try to get what he wants.
schumer intends to have vice president harris cast the tiebreaking vote, but first he needs to ensure all 50 members of his caucus are on hand to vote yes. that hasn't always been the case this year, paul kane notes.
on the economy, the number of good jobs in manufacturing has gone from boom to bust. inequality reached new extremes, as trump's appointed swamp of lobbyists, ceos and operatives worm their way into the federal bureaucracy and create more corruption, rigged rules and rip-offs. his tax cut didn't produce the $4,000 pay boost he promised; rather it lined the pockets of the rich and the corporations. chief executives used the corporate breaks mostly to buy back stock in an effort to please stockholders and boost the value of their stock options. and while his wall is arousing anger among homeowners whose properties are being requisitioned, he failed even to propose the rebuilding of america's decrepit infrastructure that he promised.
it's important to note that at this point in 2009, president obama had seven of his nominee's confirmed on day one and five more in the first week. as it stands today, we have two. democrats even held up the confirmation of cia director mike pompeo, needlessly leaving one of our most important national security agencies without its top leader on day one. it's time for senate democrats to stop playing political games with the core functions of government and to allow president trump's unquestionably qualified and talented group of cabinet nominees to get to work on behalf of the american people.
based on their performances on stage, the six democrat candidates demonstrated that not one of them deserves to win the iowa caucuses in less than three weeks, tim murtaugh, trump 2020 communications director, said in a statement. they will tank the economy, ruin health care, raise taxes, and fail to adequately defend the united states. president trump would dominate any of them in november.
spicer: no, it's not. i think...
but scholars of the presidency say that barack obama, george w. bush and their predecessors have added so many powers to the white house toolbox that a president trump could fulfill many of his promises legally — and virtually unchecked by a congress that has proven incapable of mustering much pushback for decades .
spicer: i think, the president has been very clearly. he's gonna work with any country that shares our interest in defeating isis. not just on the national security front, but on the economic front. if we can work with someone to create greater market access and spur economic growth and allow u.s. small businesses and companies to...
and, of course, advocates feel that $6 billion isn't nearly enough to address the crisis fully – although convincing a gop-led congress to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars some have suggested would be a tall order.
the second argument i'd make is that cash is much, much harder to demonize than health care. if you go to a conservative in kentucky and say the government wants to take over your health care, you can get people very, very upset about that. if you say, hey, this cash is going to hurt you, it's going to be tougher. i mean, there might be some someone there who's like, yeah, the cash is going to hurt me, but others would be like, wait a minute, they do this in alaska. if i got that money, i think i'd be very productive with it. sure, some of my neighbors less so, but, you know, first things first. so we can get americans on board because it's such a simple, straightforward vision of citizenship.
moreover, the notion that obamacare, medicare and medicaid restrict freedom is absurd, reminiscent of the pre-new deal argument that abolishing child labor impairs the freedom of employers and children to contract for labor.
iowa insurance commissioner doug ommen said that he is officially undecided about the new farm bureau law but that he sympathizes with the need for more-affordable coverage. as consumers have been hammered by the aca rates, he said, enrollment in iowa's marketplace has tumbled from nearly 75,000 in 2016 to about 61,000 last fall to 46,000 last month.
rather than try to walk it back, however, sean spicer defended trump's take the oil line during his briefing on monday. he wants to be sure america is getting something out of it for the commitment and sacrifice it is making, the press secretary said.
david mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, recalled a conversation with cruz last week in which he said the texan's message was we're making progress; hang tight and you'll be happy with the final product.
holding their tongues on georgia didn't work. republican turnout in the runoffs dropped across the state compared to november, when trump was on the ballot, too.
the plan is still a boon for the rich, however. trump would repeal the estate tax, which is levied on the inheritances of the wealthy. the richest 10 percent of taxpayers are projected to pay 90 percent of estate taxes this year, according to the nonpartisan tax policy center.
he talked about it a couple of weeks ago at his briefing about how proud he is and how much he respects the intelligence community. and i think when he walked into that and he saw it, he wanted to make sure that people knew that what you're hearing on television or in reports about this rift -- i -- i have the utmost respect for you, i honor your service, i'm proud of what you're doing and the sacrifices that you're making.
i think for to often in washington, we get our heads wrapped around a number and a statistic. and we look at and we forget the faces and the families and the businesses that are behind those numbers. and so, i think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his event, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say mr. trump, i'm working as hard as i can. i'm working two jobs, i'm doing everything by the rules, and i keep getting screwed.
every president expands the power of the presidency, said neal devins, a law professor at the college of william & mary. this is a constant pattern. they never shrink the presidency. a president trump could say 'i'm going to use the obama playbook' and go pretty far. the difference between hillary clinton and donald trump is not going to be one of lawlessness, but of the policies they pursue.
dr. anthony s. fauci said wednesday that vaccinating all teachers against covid-19 before reopening schools is 'non-workable,' wading into an issue that has taken center stage for the biden administration amid the ongoing pandemic, politico's ben leonard reports.
question: can you unequivocally state that this administration will not send more troops into iraq to, as the president has put it, take the oil?
-- the house energy and commerce committee will hold hearings on the first pieces of gop health-care replacement plans next week, signaling lawmakers are set to move swiftly on plans to repeal and replace the affordable care act. (mike debonis)
and this is all playing out against a very awkward backdrop: comey briefed trump last month on the dossier that alleged that moscow had gathered compromising financial, political and personal material about him. the ensuing conversation came with seemingly unavoidable conflicts, matt zapotosky, ellen nakashima and greg miller note. it is not clear whether comey told trump that the fbi had or was still pursuing allegations made in the dossier, but doing so would have involved telling an incoming president with significant power over the fbi that his associates were potential investigative targets.
in clark county, outside dayton, fentanyl overdoses are fueling large cost overruns for government services — foster care, paramedics and police.
that 52 percent who said trump wasn't honest actually matched the highest percentage ever to say that about barack obama, which happened in 2013, after the botched rollout of the obamacare website.
question: and -- and then, what --
imagine the wonders our country could know in america's 250th year.
well over half of gop staffers said that input from business groups was very or extremely important in shaping the policy advice they gave their bosses, the study found. over a quarter of democratic staffers said the same.
she pointed out that the administration had launched an opioid prevention ad campaign. dogs are being trained to detect fentanyl at ports of entry. congress directed the u.s. postal service to start electronically tracking packages from foreign countries. the cdc has begun improving overdose collection data to provide a clearer picture of what is happening on the ground. the administration has formed an opioid cabinet with representatives from key government agencies, and conway said they secured an additional $6 billion from congress to combat the crisis.
anti-pipeline protesters rallied outside the white house on jan. 24, after president trump signed executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines. many activists traveled to washington, d.c., from standing rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the dakota access pipeline. (zoeann murphy/the washington post)
he said that aetna's heaviest utilizers of health care — the top 1 percent to 5 percent — are driving half of the costs in the exchanges.
democrats on the house energy and commerce committee quickly criticized the president's remarks, tweeting that trump openly admits the gop is looking to dismantle the law through the ongoing lawsuit.
these lightly sketched solutions may strike many readers as small bore, given the challenges facing the country, and perhaps more cautious than hamilton himself would recommend. so too is kettl's analysis that the core of the problem is what he calls the rise of light-fare television, which he says has undermined federalism by encouraging snappy national fixes to complex, context-dependent problems.
question: but it's not whether, it's when and how?
another republican president, dwight d. eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program — the building of the interstate highway system. the time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
jonathan capehart: i mean, one could argue that when president [barack] obama came into office, he was laser-focused on getting health care to as many people as possible. and obamacare passed, but those republicans, no republican voted for it in the house. i'm having a hard time seeing how you're going to break the fever that president obama thought he was going to do in 2012 simply by your election. how are you going to convince the americans who are literally willing to die or or stay in dire economic circumstances simply because policies that you'd want to put into place and others want to put into place would benefit someone else?
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.):
-- from behind his podium, sean spicer defended trump's outrageous lie that up to five million ballots were illegally cast: the president does believe that. he has stated that before, the press secretary said during a tuesday briefing. i think he stated his concerns, voter fraud and people voting illegally, during the campaign. and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him. when asked repeatedly to provide evidence, spicer pointed to a pew study that does not support trump's claim. (jenna johnson)
question: sean, can i ask what is the u.s. strategic interest in moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem? and also, in the chat with president el-sisi today, was the status of the muslim brotherhood discussed?
so i am calling on all democrats and republicans in the congress to work with us to save americans from this imploding obamacare disaster.
republicans are happy to argue the federal government won't be getting more bang for its buck.
addiction experts also say they're worried about ensuring the money is directed to treatment supported by evidence – like medications helping those addicted wean off drugs paired with counseling – instead of pouring more money into law-enforcement tactics favored by attorney general jeff sessions, many of which appeared to be ineffective during the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s.
obamacare originally required all states to participate in the expanded medicaid program; the supreme court, in a 2012 split ruling that upheld most of the law, struck down the requirement. the law as written also required all americans to buy health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate -- at risk of a tax penalty. the trump administration whittled away at obamacare with executive actions, including one that cut funding for so-called navigator programs that help sign people up. a tax overhaul passed by republicans and signed by trump in 2017 eliminated the penalty for noncompliance, rendering the mandate moot and paving the way for the broader constitutional challenge to the law now before the supreme court.
aetna lost $450 million in the aca's exchanges last year and has cited those financial losses as the reason it slashed its marketplace participation for 2017, pulling out of 11 states. but u.s. district court judge john d. bates, who blocked the aetna-humana merger in january, found that wasn't the only reason. bates wrote in his opinion that the company exited some markets to improve the chance that the merger would be approved. in florida, the exchange business had been profitable, and the decision to leave that state was motivated by an attempt to avoid antitrust scrutiny, bates wrote.
fix the so-called family glitch in the affordable care act, which bases a family's eligibility for marketplace subsidies on whether an employee's offer of workplace coverage was affordable for the individual but not necessarily affordable for the whole family.
america will again and soon be open for business — very soon, trump said at the daily white house news conference. we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.
and to see reports that made it sound like there was some, you know, fence mending that needed(ph) to happen, that sure didn't look that way when you walked in. i'm going to move on.
bertolini said his company has not decided whether to continue selling insurance in the exchanges in 2018, but it already has exited most of the markets where it previously sold plans, remaining in only four states this year. he said that aetna is the only insurer left in nebraska's public exchange.
and i've run organizations for decades now. and what i say to people, is this. there are three ways you can treat human beings who work in your organization. no 1, you do nothing, then they leave you within a year. no. 2, you tell them how great they are. that lasts for about a year, and then they leave you before the second year. the third thing you can do is you invest in them. you compensate them. you give them raises, and you genuinely value them and then they'll stay with you forever. right now in the united states of america, we're doing some combination of one and two with our kids. we're saying, hey, things are great. you can vote. they don't really believe it. if you could look at every parent who could then look at their children and say, when you turn 18, you're going to get $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you, your country values you, and we are investing in you, that is a game changer for americans of every political party. and there are many people in red states who are already embracing this vision. i know, because i see them every day.
we are rationing the medication that would save people's lives at the moment that they're overdosing, wen recalled in a recent interview. how is that possible?
bertolini drew a portrait of the health insurance landscape caught in a deteriorating cycle. with too many sick people and not enough healthy ones buying insurance, he argued, the premiums have to keep going up. the more the premiums increase, the fewer healthy people want to sign up for care. they opt to pay the penalty instead of buying insurance with a massive deductible. that causes the balance of sick and healthy people buying insurance to worsen, prompting more rate increases and causing people — and insurers — to drop out.

donald trump has promised not only to be the voice of the american people, but also to take decisive, immediate action. as president, he has said he would move fast to destroy the islamic state, scrap bad trade deals, build that wall, stop the gangs and the violence, and stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. he would immediately suspend immigration from countries where terrorism is rampant. he might even defy treaty obligations and decline to aid nato allies.
it called for launching an anti-opioid public relations campaign, providing more funding for drug treatment and continuing to target traffickers. the report also called for access to medicine designed to wean people off opioids and to naloxone, an expensive medication that reverses overdoses.
since even before his election, trump has been viewed as dishonest by the american public according to quinnipiac university polling. the lowest percentage of poll respondents to say that trump was not honest came in november 2016, shortly after trump won the presidency and during the brief stretch that constituted his honeymoon period.
— klobuchar also made an impassioned call for improving long-term care, citing her own family's experience.
birhanzl is a recovering addict herself. she is now a director at sojourner recovery services, a treatment facility in butler county. one man she tried to help was james proffit, 40, who had lived on the streets for years. his path to fentanyl was typical. he started by taking large doses of oxycontin and then turned to heroin, not knowing it had been laced with fentanyl.

coronavirus or covid-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. they're most likely to be similar to a regular cold, the flu or seasonal allergies. (the washington post)
they're ignoring something as they cry foul. years of republican rhetoric and policy priorities, leaning heavily on the notion that the free market can determine almost everything, paved the way for this moment: the gop worked for ages to ensure that companies could decide what was best for them. call it cancel culture, or call it the free market reacting, well, freely to events.
democrats would be foolish to think, however, there is no way for them to lose. first, if trump makes the election a choice between himself and a far-left candidate, instead of a referendum on his presidency, he may well survive. second, if the economy is humming along, voters can decide a good economy outweighs all the things they dislike about him. a good economy is the most valuable asset an incumbent president can have.
meanwhile, four states have signed on to join 16 states and the district in an effort to defend the affordable care act. colorado, iowa, michigan and nevada filed a motion to intervene last thursday, arguing that they should be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit to protect their existing health-care infrastructure, which would be 'thrown into disarray' if the affordable care act, or aca, was ruled unconstitutional, the nevada independent's megan messerly reports.
sessions promised to make fentanyl a signature issue after his first trip to new hampshire, a state that had experienced one of the highest fentanyl-related death rates in the country. he attended a youth summit on opioids at manchester's downtown arena with gov. chris sununu (r) on march 7, 2017.
christie said the commission's work was an important start.
the 10 million on obamacare and 2.3 million young adults add up to 3.8 percent of the u.s. population in 2016, or more than the 3.3 percent represented in the tax returns that made payments. (we will ignore the fact that the 15 percent of the population is over 65 and in theory would be on medicare, and thus don't need health insurance.)
meanwhile, having supported a legal assault on the affordable care act, the administration urged the supreme court to decline to review an appeals court decision invalidating the law's individual mandate — a delay that would leave the law's fate conveniently uncertain until after the election, and the administration conveniently spared from facing the wrath of voters who, it turns out, like their obamacare after all. having raced to the high court numerous times with claims that emergency intervention was warranted, the administration now argues that immediate view would short-circuit the ordinary judicial process.
first one on russia. the administration was asked about multiple interactions between national security adviser mike flynn and a russian ambassador. i believe you at the time -- the administration at that time said it's -- the calls were related to setting up a discussion later between president trump and vladimir putin.
and so, if trump really wants to cut deals with democrats, there are options out there.
there are very thorough efforts underway … to bring forward a bill that might succeed, wicker told me recently. i do not, he responded when i asked whether he thinks repeal-and-replace is dead for good.
question: thank you. what did mr. (ph) curtis (ph) mean when he said that he would work through congress to get special something - we don't what it is (inaudible) recipients? and when can we expect that to happen? and also when can we expect the white house spanish site to be back up?
at 5:00 the president will host a bicameral (ph) bi partisan meeting with leaders here at the white house, will include the vice president, the senate majority leader, the senate majority whip, the senate minority leader, the senate minority whip, the house speaker, the house majority leader, the house democratic leader, the house democratic whip, the white house chief of staff, our chief strategist, chief of staff to the vice president, and chiefs of staff from those respective offices.
sessions said he has long believed in prevention and treatment programs, but as the attorney general, he was responsible for focusing on drug trafficking cases.
-- meghan mccain says trump told her he will no longer go after her father. mccain told politico the president called her in the fall to say he would back off sen. john mccain, who is being treated for brain cancer, following months of criticizing the arizona republican for his vote against the republican skinny repeal health-care bill in august.
but mulvaney's assertion really goes off the rails when you consider the impact of the expansion of medicaid, the health program for the poor. he did not mention it, but that was also a key part of the affordable care act. the law offered medicaid to nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of the poverty level, or $27,821 for a family of three in 2016. in kentucky, far more people qualified for health care under medicaid than signed up for obamacare insurance.
the actual history of the va choice program goes like this: congress passed the program under obama as a way of addressing the 2014 scandal in which veterans affairs facilities were found to be obscuring long wait times for medical appointments. the program allowed one-third of veterans to get government-paid health care in private settings.
while the fentanyl epidemic has mostly affected white americans, the drug is increasingly claiming more african american lives in cities like washington, philadelphia, st. louis and baltimore. between 2013 and 2017, 1,261 people died from fentanyl overdoses in baltimore, which has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the country. the maryland department of health found that an additional 566 people died in the first nine months of 2018, the most recently available data for the city. that far exceeds the number of homicides committed during the entire year, when 309 people were murdered in baltimore.
additionally, the president issued a memorandum reestablishing the mexico city policy, stating that the united states will end the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices.
the document does not say anything about those personal exemptions, as they are called, and how trump intends to handle those exemptions is crucial to how his plan will affect ordinary families.
sharfstein and other public health experts also note that the administration is seeking to repeal the affordable care act and cut $1.5 trillion over 10 years from medicaid. more than 500,000 people addicted to opioids could lose their drug treatment coverage if the aca is repealed, according to the kaiser family foundation. the proposed medicaid cuts could further reduce coverage.
why so few people? that's because many more people qualified for exemptions from paying the fee. in 2015, 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. exemptions are granted for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that an individual has income below a certain threshold and lives in a state that did not expand the eligibility for medicaid. the second-most common exemption is if a citizen lives outside of the united states. people also did not need to pay a penalty if they would have had to pay more than 8.05 percent of their income (in 2015) to obtain health insurance.
major insulin makers lilly, sanofi sa and novo nordisk have been making some of their life-sustaining diabetes medicine available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients, manas and michael add. …t1international, which represents people with type 1 diabetes, said lilly's half-price insulin has been difficult to obtain and said the latest move 'may be nothing more than a further pr response to continued pressure from advocates.'

dean heller ( nev. ) heller has said he'd concerned republicans' overhaul would pull the rug out on some of nevada's most vulnerable people, like medicaid recipients: i cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away the insurance from tens of thousands of nevadans. but he said monday he'd vote for a procedural vote to debate various health-care options. read more »
question: ...time (ph). just to follow up on the china question. china actually has the regional agreement called the regional comprehensive economics partnership and now japan and australia, two of our great allies are talking about joining that.
a broader question is not how the plan would affect rich households as opposed to the poor, but what it would mean for the u.s. economy overall.
spicer: ok. let's take them one at a time.
a deadly winter storm left 3.2 million people without power and with no heat for more than 24 hours in texas. desperate to stay warm amid record-low temperatures, some people have turned their cars on in the garage or sought to hear their homes using charcoal grills. the result has been a spike in reports of carbon monoxide poisoning, the post's paulina villegas reports.
asked about the judge's assessment of aetna's motivations, bertolini said that he had 450 million reasons to get out of the exchanges, referring to the company's financial losses. he indicated that without withdrawing, the company projected greater losses, of $800 million to $900 million.
today's system of checks and balances, he said , is an abject failure.
clinical trials showed that vaccines made by astrazeneca and johnson & johnson are effective against the coronavirus, but less so than the ones made by moderna or by pfizer and biontech. still, experts point out that the narrative is not that simple: astrazeneca's and johnson & johnson's vaccines were being tested in clinical trials after new variants of the coronavirus started to circulate widely, which may have reduced their efficacy compared to the vaccines that completed their trials earlier.
ryan also shed crocodile tears over the prospect of gridlock if democrats take the majority. really? since trump took office, what are his accomplishments other than an unpopular tax plan (see above)? did he push through a new health-care plan to replace the affordable care act? forge a deal to protect beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program? garner support for major infrastructure project? no, no and no. (he did push through a budget that exploded the debt, however.)
those are the kinds of things the president, he's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether or not the american people are doing better as a whole and whether or not a family.
the deal, which has strong support in the senate but may have a harder time passing the house today, would add more than $500 billion in federal spending over the next two years, delivering the military funding boost sought by president trump alongside the increase in domestic programs sought by democrats, the post's erica werner and mike debonis report. with a government shutdown deadline looming at midnight, the accord holds the promise of breaking a months-long partisan standoff centered on federal spending, though roadblocks remain, they write.
-- they say it's a medieval solution, a wall. it's true, trump said. because it worked then, and it works even better now.
question: you accepted his apology, though.
spicer: right. immigration's obviously going to be high on that last. tax reform, regulatory reform. that's three and four.
— the american college of physicians, the second-largest physician group in the country, for the first time says it supports a single-payer health-care approach, modern healthcare's rachel cohrs reports.
between september and december 2017, an additional 9,940 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. samantha huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from springfield, mo., was one of them.
nobody knows how long this is going to last, bustos told reporters. and here's the thing, it's not like coronavirus hits dems and not republicans.
— biden and trump have allowed their campaigns to launch deeply personal offensives against the other in recent days as they confront a likely general election clash before a nation grappling with a viral pandemic, our colleagues matt, michael scherer and josh dawsey report. the faceoff comes as much of the presidential campaign has been either put on hold or shifted online as the contenders retool for an new era of economic crisis and social distancing. fundraisers have been postponed, rallies have been canceled, and new technologies are under consideration.
question: and follow up to don carls (ph) question. so are you retracting your claim on saturday that it was the largest crowd in person for the inauguration?
tonight, as i outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.
now it's all about the coronavirus. rep. tom o'halleran (d-ariz.) said it's always about, 'what meeting are you going to on the virus?' or, 'what are you going to do on the virus bill?'
we didn't get into this crisis overnight. we're not going to get out overnight, kellyanne conway, counselor to the president and the administration's leading voice on the epidemic, said in an interview.
last month, the president secured a promise from chinese president xi jinping to ban all variants of fentanyl, although government officials said it is too early to tell whether the chinese government will follow through amid the escalating trade war.
we have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.
-- building the wall could take at least 10 years, even with 10,000 workers. (todd frankel does the math.)
in ohio, fentanyl is ravaging parts of the state and overwhelming the system, sen. rob portman (r-ohio) said in an interview.
however, rudolph w. giuliani, one of trump's personal attorneys, said the president's lawyers have made clear to justice department officials that they want to see mueller's completed report before the department decides what to share with congress.
tonight, i am also calling on this congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.
the white house has repeatedly avoided endorsing the position of the health officials whose scientific guidance biden assured the nation would be the north star of his administration's coronavirus response, he adds.
spicer: well, i think what we have is a -- is a mandate to make health care more accessible and lower costs. that's what the american people were promised under obamacare.
brat speaks answers a question during the town hall meeting. (timothy c. wright/for the washington post)
question: why did the president choose the british prime minister as the first foreign leader for him to meet? and can we take from that that he intends to make the relationship even closer?
in a single year, the president said more than the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years, our colleagues glenn kessler, salvador rizzo and meg kelly write. put another way: he averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019.
trump was the first republican presidential nominee to propose federal child-care benefits, but his plan was criticized because it would disproportionately help wealthy parents. a senior administration official told the washington post tuesday that trump's staff is trying to find a way to address those criticisms. wednesday's document states that child care will be part of trump's plan but offers no further details.
ouch: the national archives admitted it made numerous changes to a photo of the 2017 women's march showcased at the national archives exhibit celebrating the centennial of women's suffrage.
vice president kamala harris gets two pinocchios for her claim that the biden vaccine plan was starting from scratch.
spicer: i am not. i am saying that it was the total largest audience witnessed in person and around the globe.
and, acting on the first possible day to begin the one-year process of withdrawing from the paris climate agreement, the administration served formal notice to the united nations that it would abandon the accord, forsaking the global effort to combat climate change.
john p. walters, director of the white house office of national drug control policy during the george w. bush administration, said that after two years and a presidential commission to study the problem, the trump administration is still struggling to confront the deadliest drug crisis in u.s. history and is not dedicating nearly enough federal resources.
if trump wants, he can unleash serious damage by undermining the individual markets in three ways. insurers currently making decisions will closely scrutinize signs from the administration to gauge those markets' long-term viability. his administration can weaken the individual mandate through various mechanisms, which would mean fewer younger and healthier people and higher premiums. it can pull back on all forms of outreach designed to get people to enroll on the marketplaces. or it can stop paying cost-sharing reductions to insurance companies, which enable them to reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income enrollees, which may encourage insurers to flee the markets.
sessions also ramped up federal prosecutions of all fentanyl offenses and sent additional prosecutors to 10 areas in the country with the highest number of overdoses.
sen. jeff merkley (d-oregon) asked mick mulvaney to weigh in on the dispute over inauguration crowd sizes:
california's $72,000 estimate for a hospital stay for coronavirus is considerably larger than what other analysts have projected. kaiser family foundation researchers found the average employer-sponsored plan pays an average of $20,292 for hospital admission of a patient with pneumonia and major complications. the average cost ranged from $11,533 to $24,178, depending on the area of the country.
it's been a dark, covid-19 winter.
when we checked to see how many orders were reversed within a new administration's first 60 days, the numbers were still relatively low. six presidents still reversed three or fewer. gerald ford took second place, reversing 17, while ronald reagan took top place, reversing 22 of his predecessors' executive orders.
with little warning and no explanation, the centers for disease control and prevention canceled a major climate change conference that had been scheduled for next month in atlanta. the climate and health summit, which had been in the works for months, was intended as a chance for public health officials around the country to learn more about the mounting evidence of the risks to human health posed by the changing climate, brady notes.
the new mysterious, pneumonialike virus has sickened dozens and as of saturday, three people have died. authorities don't know what the virus is but say it's a type known as a coronavirus. there's been a surge of infections, which has convinced some experts that the virus can be transmitted from person to person, as our post colleague anna fifield reports.
spicer: most of them we have existing trade agreements with -- or a good chunk of them, we have existing trade agreements to -- to being with. this was an expansion of that, and some in areas, it allowed, whether it was the service industry, financial services, additional market access.
nothing happened, wen said. we never heard back.
-- trump's top economic adviser gary cohn is leaving his post at goldman sachs with a payout of more than $100 million, according to a late filing from the investment bank. goldman says it paid cohn $65 million in cash for long-term bonuses he was owed, cnn money reports. it also sped up stock awards worth $35 million and lifted restrictions on $23 million in locked-up goldman shares so cohn could sell them.
trump's nominee to lead the office of management and budget, rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), defended his support for cuts to popular entitlement programs that trump vowed to keep intact during the campaign. from ylan q. mui: in appearances before the senate budget and homeland security committees … mulvaney presented himself as a 'straight shooter' and said he would continue to warn about the growing costs of social security and medicare.... 'my job … is to be completely and brutally honest with him,' he said. … mulvaney said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for social security to 70 but emphasized that he would not reduce benefits for current recipients. he also reiterated his support for means-testing to qualify for medicare.
this isn't a health-care plan that helps you if you need health care. not when it would give you higher premiums, higher deductibles and worse coverage. no, this is a health-care plan that only helps you if you're wealthy and have a lot of investment income. it would cut the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends from 23.8 to 20 percent for households making $250,000 or more. other than that, you're out of luck — and maybe out of being insured. indeed, the cbo estimates that the senate bill's $1.1 trillion of cuts to health insurance spending would result in 22 million fewer people having insurance in 10 years' time. all so that the top 2 percent of households, who are the only ones really getting ahead in today's economy, can have 2 percent more money after taxes.
the center-right niskanen center put it exquisitely: liberty is a vital principle of the open society, but so are community and equality. absolutizing any of these political goods is the essence of ideological thinking, while moderation is a recognition that all of them are important. such a recognition necessarily puts some constraints on the achievement of any of these principles. and to buttigieg's point, even freedom to attain one's ambitions requires other limits on freedom (e.g. taxes to pay for schools).
— in an editorial last week, the wall street journal's editorial board argued that federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.
any new president comes in with a certain degree of goodwill and political capital, said joe hagin, who spent 14 years as a white house aide in republican administrations, culminating in eight years as deputy chief of staff to george w. bush. what's happening in the nation and the world at any given time affects your ability to move quickly. and if you look at what we were able to do post 9/11, it's almost unprecedented.
wednesday . the health it expo begins on
thursday . ahip holds a webinar on telemedicine on
question: and i know the different...
and now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.
question: elijah cummings, maryland congressman -- democratic maryland congressman, confirmed that president donald trump talked to him at the luncheon about the high price of prescription drugs.
donna edwards , the former maryland democratic congresswoman: beware when you hear trump wave a flag for african americans.
as dan balz explained this morning: there is no benign explanation.… it is either a deliberate attempt to undermine faith in the democratic process, an exhortation to those who favor new restrictions on access to the ballot box or the worrisome trait of someone with immense power willing to make wild statements without any credible evidence. by repeating as president what he had said as a candidate, for whatever purpose, trump is now striking at the foundation of a democratic society. this is yet another example of trump being willing to cast doubt on information, individuals or institutions that he believes threaten his legitimacy, challenge his authority or question his actions.... this is not a debate about the size of the crowd at last week's presidential inauguration. that is a piddling controversy compared to his claim that the election system overseen by the states is somehow riddled with fraud. trump prefers his own reality, even if that damages the very system of government atop which he now sits.
the fact checker is a verified signatory to the international fact-checking network code of principles
the last consideration — casting trump not as their protector but as a menace — will be key. telling voters he's an awful person may be totally ineffective; they know that already. telling them that he's going after their medicare and obamacare, hurting farmers with a tariff war, making the gap between rich and poor worse, and endangering the planet for them and their children by willful ignorance over climate change is quite another. the more concrete and immediate the threat (e.g., extreme weather, loss of health-care coverage), the more impact the message may have.
rounding out today's schedule, after the reception that i mentioned, he will have dinner with -- oh we have a meeting with the house speaker paul ryan. they will discuss the republican legislative agenda and strategy going forward. early in the day the president nominated former new mexico, congress woman heather wilson as the next secretary of the air force. she grew up in key new hampshire and made history as part of the third u.s. air force academy class that included women.
john sides: it sounds as if this case didn't exactly end the debate between religious liberty and anti-discrimination principles.
question: i said needless to say, this is the big one, and it's the first.
the bailout, in other words, mostly helped wall street, but didn't exclusively help it. that's more than you can say for the gop's health-care plan.
news coverage and social media posts about clinical trial results are creating a hierarchy of covid vaccines in the minds of much of the public: 'good vaccines' and 'bad vaccines.' the former you might try to seek out; the latter might even prompt you to step out of line, stat news's helen branswell reports.
most of it, including tax subsidies to help people afford coverage and, in 39 states (including the district of columbia), expanded eligibility for medicaid, the u.s. health insurance program for low-income americans. key obamacare consumer protections that also remain in place allow children to stay on a parent's policy until age 26, require insurance companies to treat people with preexisting conditions equally and prohibit the imposition of annual or lifetime coverage limits.
if he changes, he could have a different presidency. but he's going to have to tell the freedom caucus and the hard right special wealthy interests who are dominating his presidency … he can't work with them and we'll certainly look at his proposals. but it's going to be guided on our values.
several other democratic members of congress have proposed legislation along these lines. sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.) has proposed lowering the eligibility age to 50. the choose medicare act from sens. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), jeff merkley (d-ore.) and chris murphy (d-conn.) would let any american buy into medicare, including employers who could purchase medicare plans for their employees.

-- noteworthy: trump held stock in the company building the dakota access pipeline – raising concerns that his investments could affect his decision making related to the $3.8 billion project. cbs news reports: trump's 2016 federal disclosure forms show he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in texas-based energy transfer partners … [and] owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in phillips 66, which has a one-quarter share of dakota access. while trump's stake in the pipeline company is modest compared with his other assets, ethics experts say it's among dozens of potential conflicts that could be resolved by placing his investments in a blind trust.
secondly, we should help americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.
michigan gov. gretchen whitmer's administration agreed to pay former state health department director robert gordon $155,506 as part of an agreement that prohibited the two parties from disclosing information about the circumstances that led to his abrupt departure in january.
and there's another potential obstacle. the health-care industry, already up in arms over medicare-for-all proposals, probably would hate the idea of medicaid-for-all even more because the program reimburses health-care providers at even lower rates than for medicare services.
it took watergate for the parties to stand up to nixon and attempt to constrain the presidency. the question really is, what unilateral action against isis would be so extreme that congress would pass a funding ban?
spicer: i don't think that's accurate at all. in fact i think if you list to the audio of it, you can hear the excitement that exists there. there were some people that had to be off camera for obvious reasons, but i think when you look at the number of people that were there, the audio alone tells -- tell -- you know, speaks volumes to what had happened.
the president walked out of a white house meeting with democratic leaders yesterday, calling it a total waste of time, after nancy pelosi said she's not going to cave on the wall. i said bye-bye, the president tweeted, nothing else works! democrats said trump slammed his hand on the table in anger as he exited the situation room. vice president pence denied this and said he passed out candy bars to the democrats.
meet lucas, the first ever gerber spokes-baby with down syndrome:
at the start of the day, we got a cbs news poll that tested the popularity of washington's leaders. pelosi scored a 39 percent approval rating. that was shy of her disapproval — 50 percent — but it was significantly better than trump's split (36-59) and far better than senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's (r-ky.) 25-55. it also appears to be her best mark in a poll since the last time she was speaker a decade ago.
the president began his day with a breakfast with key u.s. business leaders where the focus of the discussion was on job creation and growing our manufacturing base.
a group of prominent scientists is calling on the biden administration to implement enforceable standards aimed at preventing airborne transmission of the coronavirus, kaiser health news's christina jewett reports . in a letter sent to the cdc on monday, the experts say that broader use of n95 masks, better ventilation and other public health measures are needed to protect workers in risky workplaces, including health care, food processing and prisons.
some of the most visible trump health officials, like jerome adams, the former surgeon general, and alex azar, the former hhs secretary, have yet to announce new ventures. a person familiar with azar's thinking says he's intentionally taking his time.
question: thank you. when will the -- when will you guys commence the building of the border wall?
first, it framed the decision in terms of free exercise of religion, not freedom of speech.
one-third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges — leaving many americans with no choice at all.
there are just a handful of experts on medicaid care in congress, and most of them have retired, shalala said.
the reason? congressional offices pay a lot of attention to what big business groups are saying — especially when those groups give them money.
one potential stumbling block for cruz and other conservatives is the increasing possibility that gop leaders will not repeal all of the obamacare taxes. rank-and-file members have discussed keeping or delaying some of the taxes to help pay for such costly programs as banning insurers from charging more for patients with preexisting conditions and extending federal payments to states that accepted medicaid expansion under the aca, according to several gop aides familiar with the talks.
an incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.
ryan refused to take up a resolution condemning the president's equating of neo-nazis with those protesting neo-nazis. he proclaimed, i think that would be — that would be so counterproductive. if we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country? well, if republicans didn't oppose it then . . . never mind.
-- robert becker, who oversaw sanders's iowa campaign in 2016, was accused of forcibly kissing a female subordinate during the democratic national convention. politico's alex thompson reports: becker, now 50 years old, told the 20-something woman that he had always wanted to have sex with her and made a reference to riding his 'pole,' according to the woman and three other people who witnessed what happened or were told about it shortly afterward by people who did. later in the night, becker approached the woman and abruptly grabbed her wrists. then he moved his hands to her head and forcibly kissed her, putting his tongue in her mouth as he held her, the woman and other sources said. the woman did not formally report the incident at the time because the campaign was over. sanders's principal campaign committee said in response to the allegations that robert becker would not be a part of any future campaigns.
question: and then the second thing is (inaudible) the cia, on saturday he was talking about the u.s. not taking oil during the iraq war. and said that there could be in another pinch for that. what does he mean when he said that?
spicer: it is. it's an honor to do this, and yes. i believe that we have to be honest with the american people. i think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. there are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. but our intention's never to lie to you, jonathan. our job is to make sure that sometimes -- and you're in the same boat -- there are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story, and you publish a correction. that doesn't mean that you were trying to deceive readers and the american people, does it? and i think we should be afforded the same opportunity. there are times when we believe something to be true, or we get something from an agency, or we act in haste because the information available wasn't complete, but our desire to communicate with the american people and make sure that you have the most complete story at the time. and so we do it.
the caucus's influence also has limits, especially because democrats control the house. the group and its allies are outnumbered in congress, whose cooperation the president needs to implement his agenda. for example, when the white house recently joined a legal challenge against the affordable care act — a decision traced to mulvaney — members of both congressional parties openly complained. trump promised a new health-care law to replace the aca, or obamacare, but retreated when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) told him the senate wouldn't pass one.

democrats were unceasingly critical of the president — and so, on the whole, was coverage from mainstream media outlets, which covered his near-daily controversies and how he smashed through democratic norms.
we have withdrawn the united states from the job-killing trans-pacific partnership.
trump could justify an all-out assault on isis by pointing to the same kinds of authority that allowed the bush administration to use torture against alleged terrorists and allowed the obama administration to expand the use of drones to kill terrorist suspects. recent presidents have used their constitutional authority as commander in chief even to take actions that are specifically restricted by law.
a letter to congress in 2017 by the then-irs commissioner gave a little more detail about the 2015 payments: the median payment was about $330, and 7 percent were $100 or less. the vast majority — 77 percent — of taxpayers reporting a shared responsibility payment still reported a refund, the letter said. about 8 million taxpayers reported a payment in 2014. so the trend line had been going down.

-- an early test of trump's ethics pledge is a glittering new tower in canada, by drew harwell, alan freeman and jenny peng: as president trump settles into his first week in the white house, the first paying guests will begin checking in tonight into the lavish suites of the trump international hotel & tower vancouver, a glass skyscraper developed by the son of one of malaysia's wealthiest business executives. the tower, the first foreign business launch of the trump brand during the new presidency, is an early test of trump's controversial decision to retain ownership of his businesses while promising to combat ethical conflicts by removing himself from the management. it also shows how trump properties around the world are likely to become focal points for protest or other forms of expressions aimed at the u.s. president and his policies…
as we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. bad ones are going out as i speak tonight and as i have promised.
we have seen the attacks in france, in belgium, in germany and all over the world.
he's a vote-getter: the senate majority — and whether republicans could block democrats' governing majority — hung in the balance the same week that congress was going to confirm president-elect joe biden's win. the two republican senate candidates had gone all in on trump and his false election fraud claims. trump held a rally in georgia on monday, the eve of the election and two days before the riot at the capitol. sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.) joined him there, and announced that she'd be challenging trump's electoral college loss in her state despite there being no evidence or legal basis to do so.
a new chapter of american greatness is now beginning.
he also gave an unpopular answer when asked if he agreed with trump that the administration was running smoothly so far.

another group - and this a follow-up on cbn's question a moment ago, when we have the march for life here in washington, you've said that this is a pro-life president, what concrete promises is he making? we haven't heard a lot about what that policy is going to look like.

some health policy experts said the report, while not groundbreaking, did provide a blueprint for the trump administration to follow.
but that's wrong. according to most recent internal revenue service data (statistics of income), for 2016, 4.95 million taxpayers made the payment, at an average cost of $732. that's a decline from the year before, when nearly 6.67 million taxpayers made payments at an average cost of $462. the penalty had been increasing, but effective jan. 1, 2019, the tax bill signed by president trump set the penalty at zero. (the mandate has not been eliminated.)
but the outlook is troubling for other americans. if they are insured, they'll mostly be covered after meeting their annual deductible, but they'll still cause a boost in health-care spending that will make future premiums more expensive for everyone else.
they also report trump still likes jackson and believes he has been unfairly treated, according to a white house official.
a navy spokeswoman, lt. christina sears, said jackson is still assigned to the white house, they write. the navy originally submitted jackson's name for promotion last year before trump nominated him to be va secretary, and the white house resubmitted it, she said.
drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year, trump said. and that's why my department of justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we've ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that i talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. and that penalty is going to be the death penalty.
first, he issued a presidential memorandum withdrawing the united states from the trans-pacific partnership. tpp is a multilateral agreement that includes the united states and 11 other countries. as the president has said many times, this type of multinational agreement is not in our best interest and he's moving quickly to advance trade policies that increase the competitiveness of the american worker and manufacturer.
the republican attempt to reshape the nation's health-care system has grown increasingly dependent this week on the fragile alliance between senate gop leaders and a man they have clashed bitterly with for years: sen. ted cruz (r-tex.).
spicer: good afternoon, everyone. thanks for coming out to our first official briefing here in the brady room. i was going to start with a recap of the inauguration, but i think we've covered that pretty well. by the way, just as i get started, i know that josh earnest was voted the most popular press secretary by the press corps, so after reading -- checking my twitter feed, i shot josh an e-mail last night letting him know that he can rest easy, that his title is secure for at least the next few days.
no one knows what trump would really do, which is why people are so freaked out, devins, the law professor , said. if he did push the boundaries dangerously, it really would depend on congress, and it would take an awful lot for republicans to join with the democrats to assert themselves and slap him down.
hhs secretary alex azar delivers the keynote address at the academyhealth national health policy conference.
although it's actually even worse than that. a 64-year-old making $26,500 would, according to the congressional budget office, see their premiums for a silver plan go from $1,700 under obamacare to $6,500 under the senate bill — but it'd be for a silver plan that covered 17 percent less of their expected medical expenses. so they'd be paying more to get less. how much more? well, the kaiser family foundation calculates that, in the case of our hypothetical 64-year-old, their deductible would go from $809 to $6,105. and it'd be an even bigger jump for people a little bit lower on the income ladder. someone making just $18,090 would see their deductibles increase from $255 to the same $6,105. the senate bill, then, would leave a lot of people with a choice between plans they couldn't afford to buy and couldn't afford to use.
question: do you dispute, though, his tweet about comparing the intelligence community to nazi germany?
to the contrary, time and again, ryan has been an impediment to bipartisan dealmaking, most clearly in refusing to bring a daca fix to the floor. maybe gridlock will occur if democrats take control after november's midterm elections, but they could hardly be less productive than the gop-controlled house. moreover, left to their own devices, it is certainly possible that chuck and nancy [house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.)] could make deals with trump on daca, infrastructure and even on shoring up the obamacare exchanges. the greatest obstacle to bipartisan legislation is the freedom caucus, which ryan allows to run amok.

among the republicans who early on recognized biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are utah's mitt romney, maine's susan collins and alaska's lisa murkowski.
spicer: there are no plans for that now. it's always possible. he's been having a tremendous number of calls. i think the number is well over 80 now of people that have talked to him, congratulated him prior to being elected. he's had a -- we read out the other day he's met with both canada and mexico. i think he's talked -- prime minister netanyahu yesterday, president el-sisi today. i think there's -- there's going to continue to be a robust number of world leaders.
— democrats are pushing for bigger government, feeling liberated from years of countering attacks on big spending ideas after republicans made some high-cost moves themselves. in recent months, democratic lawmakers and candidates have endorsed plans allowing anyone to buy in to medicare, to make college effectively debt-free, to replace the payday loan industry with small government banks and to provide a 'job guarantee' that would spend to put people to work, our colleagues dave weigel and jeff stein report.
the answer to that is, given the obstruction in d.c., it's remarkable what he has gotten done, he said. the crowd drowned out his answer forcing him to struggle for a moment — the stock market is going like 'zing!' for the first time — before moving on to a question about the second amendment.
and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
-- spicer also took the first question at his briefing from a reporter who works for lifezette, a tiny website founded by trump supporter laura ingraham that published some untrue stories during last year's campaign. spicer's move also breaks with the longtime tradition of calling upon a famous mainstream organization, such as the ap or a major television network, first. (ap)
hhs spokeswoman caitlin oakley responded this way: we do not comment on conversations or meetings between secretary azar and the president. the trump administration has done more than any other administration in history to lower the high cost of prescription drugs and we fully anticipate this momentum will continue.
rep. lamar smith (r-texas) made quite a remark on the house floor:
presidential executive orders are a comparatively popular tool. if we tally them all from harry truman (1945-1953) up through barack obama, we get a total of 4,244. different presidents, of course, leaned on them to different degrees: at the high end, truman averaged 117 each year; obama's average was a mere 35 .
spicer: (inaudible) i know it's still developing and i would refer you back to the department of defense. i know that they're -- they're currently monitoring this and i would refer you back to them on that. and i think...
not only that, but in many cases you're seeing these -- the rates go up 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 percent. that's not what they were promised either. and so what i think the president's doing -- and it's not just -- i think he's gotten bipartisan support for this.
a president who might act unilaterally was one of the chief fears expressed in the original debates about the constitution. writing in the federalist papers in 1787, the pseudonymous cato warned against the presidency becoming a caesar, caligula, nero, and domitian in america. the system of checks and balances — giving congress the authority to make laws and decide how money is spent, and giving the supreme court the last word on what laws comport with the constitution — was supposed to rein in the president.
but inside the meeting with senators wednesday, there was not unanimity on trump's approach, erica werner, sean sullivan, mike debonis and seung min kim report. moderate sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) and susan collins (r-maine) pleaded with trump to reopen the government, according to lawmakers present.

but there's a reason that you put out several of these statistics, its so that economists can view them and decide, look at different landscapes on -- what -- on -- on how to -- how to make economic policy.
spicer: no, i'm not going to get into conversations that i have with the president. but i will tell you that it's not -- it's not just about a crowd size. it's about this constant -- you know, he's not going to run. then if he runs, he's going to drop out. then if he runs, he can't win, there's no way he can win pennsylvania, there's no way he can win michigan.
rep. lauren underwood (d-ill.), who worked at the department of health and human services as the aca was being passed, said it's really important we leverage all existing authorities to ensure the american people have access to the care and coverage they need.
spicer: well i think the president, it's no secret, has made himself-made it very clear that he's a pro-life president. he wants to stand up for all americans including the unborn and i think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects tax payer funding as well. and ensure that we're standing up, not just for life, for life of the unborn but also for tax payer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the values of this president . and i think continue to further illustrate, not just to the folks here in this country, but around the world what a value we place on life. jennifer rodriguez (ph).
i am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the american spirit. i am asking all members of congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. and i am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --
the republican leadership explained repeatedly that we'd need trump to help get votes out, that anonymous gop senator told the hill about georgia.
it really is hard, as 538's nate silver put it, to think of anything less populist than the republican health-care plan. you might be able to say the bank bailouts were, but even that's probably not true. as unfair as it was to give money to the people most responsible for the global financial crisis — and it was on a world-historical scale, especially when they were allowed to pay themselves that money in bonuses — it at least helped prevent what in all likelihood would have been an even bigger meltdown. the only thing worse than how much credit markets seized up before the $800 billion bailout is how much they would have if there hadn't been one. more people would have lost their jobs, loans would have become impossible to come by instead of just mostly so, and they would have stayed that way more than they already have, since it can take a while for new banks to replace the relationships and local knowledge that old ones had. that, at least, is what a professor named ben bernanke found was part of the reason the recovery from the great depression was as slow as it was.
in january 2015, a group of conservative house republicans felt shut out of power and frustrated that gop leaders made legislative compromises with democrats and then-president barack obama. they founded the freedom caucus to help move their party further to the right.
a top trump official would later testify before congress that the public health declaration was intended to bring awareness.
he also hoped that trump would use the report to press congress for significant funding to fight the opioid epidemic, comparable to the $28 billion the federal government spends each year to fight the hiv/aids epidemic in the united states.

-- farmers who have come to rely on government assistance amid trump's trade war are struggling to cope without checks. annie gowen, jeff stein and sean sullivan report: the trump administration had promised to help farmers like [john] boyd, those who suffered as a result of the international trade war after chinese purchases of soybeans — once 60 percent of the market — plummeted to next to nothing. with farmers on the edge of ruin, the u.s. government offered $12 billion in support since september, checks that had become a lifeline. but with the government shutdown moving into its third week, boyd was left waiting for his support check to arrive.

overall enrollment was surprisingly resilient despite the trump administration's rollbacks of advertising for the marketplaces. the report shows that almost 11.8 million americans chose aca health plans for this year — just a half-million fewer than for 2017 and about 900,00 fewer than in 2016, amy notes. but there are several reasons why state-run marketplaces tended to fare better than the federal ones: some of them extended enrollment beyond the federal six-week sign-up season and some states chose to run robust advertising programs.
the administration's plan includes health officials working toward reducing hiv transmissions by 2030 by concentrating efforts in communities with the most hiv infections, dan writes. he also reports trump's remarks have not been finalized and the plan for tuesday evening's address could change.
-- the shutdown is also holding up government loans to small businesses. heather long, david j. lynch and renae merle report: the small business administration stopped processing new loans on dec. 22. [thousands of people] can't get their sba loans approved, meaning they can't get money they need to start or expand their companies. … even if the shutdown ends soon, there will be a backlog at the sba.
so it is worth revisiting what the trump administration did while congress was impeaching, from the moment the president's efforts to use ukraine as a tool in his reelection campaign was exposed in early september through today. these are not impeachable offenses, but they are the kind of misguided policies that, along with trump's impeachable conduct, should be in voters' mind as the election nears.
the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine holds a public session of the committee on implementing high-quality primary care on wednesday.
opioid funding is just one bullet point in a list of health-care priorities included in the potential deal. a few of the other biggies:
sen. john barrasso (r-wyo.) slammed the expanded subsidies during a floor speech yesterday, saying democrats would just increase government payments without tackling the heart of the issue, which is health-care costs.
oh, wait. that last one is actually what the senate bill would do.
on freedom, buttigieg likes to say, don't let anybody tell you that the other side is the side that's got a handle on freedom. he explains that freedom isn't merely freedom from government taxes, regulation, etc.:
ouch: the new mysterious, deadly coronavirus is sneaky and difficult to defeat. it's not alive, but it's frighteningly good at hijacking our cells and replicating millions of versions of itself to wreak havoc.
spicer: not that i'm aware of. and when i say that, what i'm saying is during the transition, i asked general flynn that -- whether or not there were any other conversations beyond the ambassador and he said no.
spicer: well, look, thank you for the question.
part of mcconnell's strategy in trying to get to 50 votes is an effort to line up support from the many republicans who come from states where medicaid is expanded and want to see a softer blow against obamacare than cruz. the republican leader's proposal for a three-year wind-down of the expansion last week — many of them are pushing for seven — reflects this.
trump also asked azar for an update on hhs's work on lowering drug pricing, and the two discussed the fact that drug importation was popular with the public, josh and yasmeen write. they also shared frustration about the number of health-care regulations that had been stopped by the courts — including a rule that would require drugmakers to post the list prices of their medications in television ads and state requirements that medicaid recipients work to maintain their coverage — and by the lack of media coverage of the administration's health-care and drug pricing policies.
spicer: i'm not gonna talk about what we may or may not do. i think the president's been very clear that he doesn't telegraph forward what -- taking options off the table. that's not a good negotiation skill. that's not how he works. there's a reason he's been successful at negotiating, is because he does it in a way that doesn't telegraph to people what he's gonna take on or off the table.
watch president trump's full memorial day speech:
yang: i think that the attitude you are describing, while it does apply to a certain subset of americans, applies to a very, very low proportion of them. and i'm confident of this because when i campaign around the country, at every event i go to, someone comes up to me in the line afterwards and says, i voted for donald trump. this time i'm voting for you. one survey in new hampshire said that 10 percent of the voters who voted for trump would vote for me over trump in the general election. another survey said that 18 percent of college republicans would choose me over the president. now, this is not everyone. but this is enough. you don't need to convert 80 percent of the president's followers. you need to convert, let's call it 20 percent. so this attitude that you're describing is very real. but i believe that it does not contain 100 percent of the folks who voted for donald trump. and i know this because, again, they come to me at my events every single time and say, you're my candidate this time..
spicer: again, i think part of is it that he's already spoken to both the president of mexico and prime minister of canada about his desire to -- to renegotiate. and i think as he meets with both of these individuals over the next 30 days or so, that's gonna be a topic.
-- many lawmakers who represent districts along the border, including some republicans, are either opposed to a wall or to using emergency powers to build it. matt viser reports: rep. mac thornberry (r-tex.), the top republican on the house armed services committee, this week said he opposes an emergency declaration to build the wall. rep. will hurd (r-tex), whose district includes 820 miles along the border, has repeatedly spoken out and voted against it. dennis nixon, a bank executive from laredo who was a top trump donor, has published a lengthy rebuttal to trump's desire for a wall.
but while kettl's solutions may not be convincing, his diagnosis of some of the pathologies undermining the republic is, and the historical background he provides on the evolution of madison's nation-founding invention will be useful to anyone seeking to flesh out additional remedies.
but at least its members are being brutally honest about the political pickle in which their allies in congress find themselcves: it's republicans – and not democrats – who are taking heat for obamacare's rate hikes since they hold the reins of power and have tinkered with the aca marketplaces without actually revamping them.
on our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to philadelphia to celebrate america's centennial. at that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.
several conservatives have bristled publicly at this posture. sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) warned yesterday, for example, that trump declaring a national emergency would create a dangerous precedent. we have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power, rubio said on cnbc. if today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.
mcneil told the panel she had reviewed the documents and asked rhetorically whether the gao could say that the drug czar's office has finally produced the congressionally mandated drug strategy.
first, biden will not spare president trump from the charge that he failed as commander in chief, sending troops (health-care workers) into the fray without sufficient protection and equipment. the more trump protests that governors do not need ventilators or that there are plenty of tests, the more fodder he provides to biden that trump is a derelict, incompetent commander in chief.

the question is whether he can pair such ideas with concessions to the right that would make the broader deal acceptable to enough senators. one possibility conservatives have identified is to use a different index to calculate how medicaid should be funded, which would mean deeper spending cuts to the program.

now, there are three ways to think about the senate bill. the first is that it would take health-care from the poor and middle-class to pay for tax cuts for the rich at a time of already historic inequality. the second is that it would make insurance more expensive for everyone and less useful for anyone who is sick. and the third is that it would hurt president trump's working-class base the most. other than that, how were the tax cuts, mrs. lincoln?

-- to be sure, many house democrats who just got elected in districts trump carried in 2016 are feeling some heat as the shutdown drags on. the freshmen arranged an impromptu 90-minute meeting over the weekend at a retreat in virginia because several new members were 'freaking out' about the ongoing shutdown and the party's strategy, politico's heather caygle and sarah ferris report. 'i don't think that it's the democrats in the house's fault that we are in a shutdown,' said rep. colin allred (d-texas), who attended the huddle in williamsburg, va., and is one of two freshman class presidents. 'but i do think it's setting us back in terms of those coalitions we're trying to build.'

5. what happens if obamacare is struck down?
-- virginia gov. ralph northam (d) delivered a state of the commonwealth speech in which he urged republican legislators to consider his proposed budget. laura vozzella and gregory s. schneider report: the governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts president trump signed last year. he wants half of that amount to fund tax breaks for virginian households making less than $54,000 a year, the state's median income. he would use the other half to shore up the state's reserve funds and make 'historic' investments in schools, the environment, rural broadband and other priorities. republicans, though, want to change virginia tax code so that much of that money goes back to taxpayers at middle- and higher- income brackets.
the administration also proposed easing environmental rules in order to speed up construction of major infrastructure projects. the proposed rule, revising an arrangement in place for a half-century, would exclude reviews of infrastructure projects built without major government involvement, set a two-year deadline for drafting and delivering most environmental impact statements, and limit the degree to which such assessments include the effects of climate change.

if you are looking for an alternative path for a conservative leader, one who even knows how to appeal to populist and nationalist sentiment, look at british prime minister boris johnson. johnson, who initially bungled covid-19 but is now tackling the pandemic with much greater seriousness, has gradually emerged as the most consequential conservative politician since margaret thatcher. he has been slowly but surely reshaping his party to make it more compatible with modern-day britain. his cabinet is remarkably diverse, with two of the three most powerful positions filled by asian britons.

it's not surprising that trump followed through on promises to issue executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines, but the administration is making a much harder play below the radar to eviscerate obama's environmental legacy.
the president backed that idea later on in his campaign, as yet another way of giving more americans access to affordable coverage. affordability of health insurance is an ongoing concern for many americans — not only for those already covered but also for the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured, despite the sweeping 2010 health-care law.
and like clinton did in 2016, they argued medicare-for-all isn't feasible in the united states.
she prodded him to add some detail to one of his usual lines about his value system. some actual principles please, not this judeo-christian generality, she said.
out of those 4,244 executive orders issued by truman and presidents since, their white house successors reversed only 508, or about 12 percent of the total. only 5 percent of those reversals came during the first 30 days of their terms, and only 14 percent during the first 60 days.
jane schacter: twenty-one states currently have their own version of rfra, and more continue to be introduced. the most expansive of these laws will surely face constitutional challenges. mississippi's law is probably the most extreme in permitting, among other things, businesses to deny service to lgbt customers and has been challenged as violating lgbt individuals' constitutional rights. the supreme court recently decided not to hear a challenge to that law, but it was a procedural question only. expect further litigation.
toward the end, spicer gave an impassioned defense of why trump dwells so much on things like his inauguration crowd size, arguing that trump is very frustrated by constant negative coverage and the media minimizing him. he basically said it amounted to a defense mechanism from the president. it was really rather interesting.
lawmakers and friends will gather at the capitol to honor the legacy of jamal khashoggi. today marks 100 days since the post contributing columnist's death. (new yorker)
obamacare is collapsing — and we must act decisively to protect all americans. action is not a choice — it is a necessity.
one important answer would be to spend a bit more money. … better subsidies would help enrollments, which in turn would probably bring in more insurers. but just in case, why not revive the idea of a public option — insurance sold directly by the government, for those who choose it? at the very least, there ought to be public plans available in areas no private insurer wants to serve.
on nov. 1, christie's commission released its final report, with 56 recommendations on the opioid crisis. some drug policy experts criticized the commission for taking too long and repackaging old ideas instead of crafting a new strategy.
in cabell county, w.va., the county with the highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation, there are long waiting lists for treatment.
rep. tom price (r-ga.), president trump's nominee to lead the health and human services department, testified before the senate finance committee, jan. 24. (sarah parnass/the washington post)
between may and august 2017, an additional 9,487 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. matthew sutton, 39, a barber from pasadena, md., was one of them.
5. what limits will democrats face?
u.s. states reported more than 100 deaths yesterday, bringing the nation's total death toll past 500.
trump's critics hear his sweeping promises as the words of a classic strongman, a ruler who seems prepared to push aside the cobwebs of bureaucracy and the checks and balances of american federalism to produce instant, decisive action. they've compared him to mussolini, hitler, vladi­mir putin, saddam hussein and argentina's juan peron. trump has praised putin and hussein for being tough on terrorism. in the past, trump has singled out china's crackdown against pro-democracy activists in tiananmen square in 1989 as a demonstration of the power of strength.
an important caveat is that the document is very brief, and republican lawmakers will have opportunities to share their ideas about how to stimulate the economy going forward.
oof: texas and mississippi are lifting their mask mandates.
the white house response is that he's not going to release his tax returns, kellyanne conway said sunday on abc's this week. she said the issue was settled in the election. people didn't care, she said. they voted for him.
-- vladimir putin has made it his mission to reestablish his country as a dominant, indispensable player in the middle east, one that can rival the influence of the united states. moscow correspondent andrew roth reports. by some measures, he is succeeding … not only has russia's 15-month-old airstrike campaign likely saved the regime of bashar al-assad, but it also spawned this week's negotiations sponsored by russia, iran and turkey to agree on a mechanism to support a delicate cease-fire in the syrian conflict. it was a russian-led diplomatic effort testing moscow's improbable role as peacemaker, with a twist that must draw smiles in the kremlin: no formal role for the united states. but for a world leader who has so often embraced the role of spoiler and antagonist to the liberal west, converting military force into diplomatic sway will prove complex. russia is seeking to show it has national interests … everywhere, throughout the middle east, said middle east experet alexei malashenko. it is a very important symbol.
spicer: then, if won, it's oh, well he(ph) -- there is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has. and i think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.
that doesn't necessarily mean they'd prefer a presidential candidate who prioritized obamacare over medicare-for-all; some respondents might be recognizing the reality that trump, his rhetoric aside, almost certainly wouldn't sign such a bill into law. as noted above, primary candidates are also in the business of pushing the envelope, often with hopes of at least improving existing legislation even if not achieving a more extreme policy goal.
even if they want to spend it exactly as i think they should, it wouldn't be enough, he said.
5. is there a big loophole in the plan?
— a few of the latest headlines and developments to catch up on this morning:
trump's 2016 election offered the freedom caucus a chance to use the same strategy with the executive branch, because trump had few allies in the gop and little knowledge of how washington worked. although the caucus and the president at first clashed over the repeal of obama's affordable care act, caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) eventually developed close relations with the president, and the group became one of his biggest advocates.
our allies will find that america is once again ready to lead.
but in a time when he's trying to unite this and he keeps talking about uniting this nation, bringing this nation together, and then a tweet goes out in a pool(ph) report to -- what? -- a few thousand people saying that he removed the bust of martin luther king, how do you think that goes over?
new york is suing amazon over allege failure to provide adequate protection to its warehouse workers, the post's jay greene reports. new york attorney general letitia james has accused the company of cutting corners on health and safety requirements and retaliating against employees who complain. amazon has disputed these accusations. (amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post.)
but it's also not fair for trump and republicans to characterize democrats as trying to eliminate medicare, when what they want to do is make the popular program accessible to everyone.
the measure's modest sum for opioids, to be spent over two years and allocated by congressional appropriators, is nonetheless congress's largest investment yet toward fighting opioid addiction and overdose, a problem now so massive that it claims the lives of more americans every year than car accidents.
overseas, as tehran's restraint saves the president from stumbling into a war with iran, he's dispatching 3,500 more troops to the middle east — on top of the thousands he already sent as the war in afghanistan continues. u.s. soldiers remain at risk in senseless deployments from syria to iraq, with the latter country's parliament voting to ask our troops to leave. even fox news loyalists such as tucker carlson are chafing at trump's betrayal of his promises.
these senators have said they will or are likely to vote against the current bill. republicans can afford only two gop no votes.
we request that the trump administration establish a national program to procure naloxone treatments and supply them to state and local health and law enforcement programs, the letter said.
and he reiterated his claim that the gop is unified:
staying on good terms with the trump white house is not easy, given the president's mercurial approach to politics and relationships. if siding with trump pushes the caucus too far from its ideological principles, the group may have trouble recruiting and keeping members, or maintaining support from conservative activists.
spicer: i'm just saying, you're asking me a question about my integrity. i have a right to say if you add up the network streaming numbers, facebook, youtube, all of the various live streaming that we have information on so far. i don't think there's any question it was -- that it was the largest watched inauguration, ever.
spicer: well, i think - i think he's going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment but i think that there's - one of the things that he talked about during the campaign is there's a balance and he's trying to make sure that we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we don't do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation.
asked about trump's proposals to ban muslims or build a border wall without congressional approval, house speaker paul ryan (r-wisc.) said last month that he would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers.
the state is the first in the country with a proposal testing the administration's push to allow states flexibility with the safety net program.
ouch: another person has died from ebola in congo, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities from the outbreak to 12, the nation's health ministry said sunday. there are also four new suspected cases of ebola in the rural area of iboko, where the death occurred, the ap's saleh mwanamilongo reports. there are now 35 confirmed cases of ebola in the congo.
uh, yeah, say longtime republican critics of trump. what took so long, asks former republican national committee official douglas heye in a cnn op-ed, when all of this was so predictable? trump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015.
brian harrison, the former hhs chief of staff, this week unveiled his campaign for congress in texas' sixth congressional district. catherine bird, who worked closely with harrison in senior hhs roles, is pitching in on the campaign.
question: sir, last week on lgbt rights. the long time republicans (inaudible) group delivered a white paper to the trump team, urging the president to maintain an executive order from president obama, borrowing anti-lgbt worker discrimination among federal contractors.
spicer: no, no. he actually apologized to my colleagues. that's the exact quote. ok? that quote, that report got tweeted out around. and to report -- where was the apology to the president of the united states? where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was? where was that apology?
jane schacter: both cases pit religious liberty against equality claims. in hobby lobby, the business argued that for religious reasons it objected to the obamacare mandate to offer insurance that covered contraception — something many women argue is essential to gender equality. but that case was decided not under the first amendment but the federal religious freedom restoration act, or rfra. that act grants stronger protection to religious liberty than does the first amendment's free-exercise clause. but because of an earlier precedent, the supreme court uses first amendment as a standard in cases like masterpiece involving the states.
-- british designer aruna seth flew $800 suede boots from london to washington the day before the inauguration so that tiffany trump could wear them. it is unclear whether trump's youngest daughter paid for the boots, or the international flight it took to receive them, but she was also spotted in another pair of seth's nude pumps to the sunday prayer service at the washington national cathedral, emily heil reports. tiffany has always been a fan of the brand since it became familiar to her, ella weinberg, who acted as the courier, said in an email. the 23-year-old had specific requirements from us for the inauguration considering the weather.
the idea is gaining traction with a number of lawmakers. on monday, nearly 70 house democrats sent a letter to their leadership to push for remote voting, politico's sarah ferris reports.
i will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
but what will america look like as we reach our 250th year? what kind of country will we leave for our children?
we all salute the same flag.
spicer: we've gotten many of them filled.
the georgia congressman also kept the door wide open to turning medicaid into a block grant, something he has supported as chairman of the house budget committee. in one particularly heated exchange with democratic sen. bob menendez, price was asked whether turning medicaid into a block grant program would mean fewer people would be eligible in the future, cnn notes. the decades-old entitlement program extends health coverage to low-income americans, and menendez noted that as an entitlement program, anyone who meets the criteria currently has the right to be covered. 'when you move to a block grant, do you still have the right?' menendez asked. 'no, i think it would be determined by how that was set up,' price said. price's apparent acknowledgement that some low-income americans may not be covered if republicans move medicaid over to a block grant system would mark a radical shift in the purpose that the program is supposed to serve.
* how democrats should proceed now: e.j. dionne charts the path forward for democrats, now that it looks like the aca is here to stay for the foreseeable future:
on wednesday the president will host a swearing in ceremony from new secretary of homeland security, general james kelly -- john kelly. and then on friday he will do the same for secretary mattis at the department of defense. on thursday he will travel to philadelphia to attend the republican house and senate retreat. and on friday he will welcome his first foreign head of state, british prime minister, may. with that i look forward to taking your questions.
larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation, noted congress doesn't seem terribly concerned with policies to help rein in health-care spending. the deal repeals ipab and and delays the cadillac tax on high-cost health plans (two parts of the aca intended to do just that):
the law in question requires a doctor providing abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the procedure. a similar law in texas was struck down by supreme court in a 5-to-3 vote in 2016.
mandating every american to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for america. the way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.
it is ironic for gary abernathy to imply that everyone who doesn't like president trump should support him regardless, simply because he is the president, by suggesting that he personally didn't like president barack obama yet still supported him, whatever that means.
it provides a check on a lot of this. but again, i -- he's always gonna be fighting for the interest of the country and the american worker. so where -- how we engage and with whom, is gonna be decided on whether or not we can get a deal that benefits our country, economically and in terms of national security. that there are there things that we can do economically, that actually end up also benefiting us from a national security standpoint because of the economic relationship that exists between the two countries.
covered california estimate calculated total costs to the system based on three scenarios. there's the scenario in which coronavirus has low impact, in which 400,000 people are hospitalized in the u.s.; medium impact where 1.2 million are hospitalized; and high impact where 3 million people are hospitalized.
7. what has biden done already?
advocates were forced to dramatically scale back their plans to celebrate the aca's decade of existence on march 23. president obama released a video message instead of delivering an address at american university, which was canceled.
spicer: i think you guys might want to leave before i do. but look, i want to make sure that we have a healthy relationship. we saw the other day that -- and i'm not trying to rehash history, but you're asking the question so i'm going to answer it. you know, we had a tweet go out about martin luther king.
i said to [trump] that i thought there was a lack of urgency to the way president obama's administration had dealt with this issue, and that as a result, the problem had gotten worse, christie recalled in an interview. we needed to go after this in a really aggressive way.
trump and his advisers have repeatedly said they support some form of taxation on imports. one possibility is the plan proposed by republicans in the house, including speaker paul d. ryan (wis.), which would tax imports at the regular rate on corporate income.
the scale of death here is really unprecedented, and so you have to judge the response against the scale of the problem, said joshua m. sharfstein, vice dean at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. you can have some progress, but it's really insufficient if you are not up to the scale of the problem.
in kenya, public health experts raised immediate concerns about the new policy. women here often resort to dangerous methods to end their pregnancies, including drinking battery acid and using wire coat hangers. in parts of rural kenya, young women have hired local healers to stomp on their stomachs until the pregnancy is deemed over. 'trump's policy means even fewer services will be offered,' said chimaraoke izugbara, a researcher at the african population and health research center (aphrc) in nairobi. 'some women will not be reached, and providers may not be available to offer services. i think we are headed to a major disaster.' nearly 8,000 women in kenya die every year from complications caused by pregnancy and childbirth. at least a fifth of those deaths are caused by self-induced abortions, according to izugbara.
allow medicare to pay 50 percent more to rural hospitals and providers, up from a 25 percent allowance.
for instance, reagan's mexico city policy, which denied u.s. government funding for nongovernmental organizations that provided advice, counseling, or information regarding abortion, was reversed and then reinstated in a series of memoranda by presidents clinton, george w. bush and obama. trump will likely make another reversal.
in just a few years, the synthetic painkiller became the deadliest drug ever to hit u.s. streets. manufactured in chinese and mexican labs, illicit fentanyl has played a significant role in reducing the overall life expectancy of americans. it is so powerful, just a few flecks the size of grains of salt can cause acute respiratory failure and rapid death.
but what republicans don't acknowledge in this defense is that much of trump's drama they themselves privately opposed.
the hawkeye state's latest strategy has a back-to-the-future quality. starting in 1969, the nonprofit iowa farm bureau sold wellmark blue cross and blue shield policies to its members. the arrangement ended when the aca came along, because those health plans did not meet the federal law's rules and would have exposed consumers to penalties.
white house chief of staff reince priebus issued an order friday night to freeze all regulations that haven't yet been formally published in the federal register. politico's josh gerstein reports that at least 62 new regs have already been withdrawn, and the number could go far higher: some of the matters are weighty, like planned cancellation of sanctions against burma (now on hold) or rules to give military spouses preferences in federal hiring. some have already drawn public attention, like a delay in new rules about mistreatment of horses. other actions suspended by the white house move seem less than earth-shattering, like the planned campground fee for public land in richland county, north dakota. however, at least a few of the halts seem troubling, like the withdrawal of a rule about inspecting aircraft fuselages for cracks. the department of housing and urban development also pulled new rules to streamline income tests for federally subsidized housing.
inmates in the women's cellblock at the fayette county jail in washington court house, ohio, a state hit hard by the country's fentanyl crisis. fighting fentanyl trump called the opioid epidemic a priority, but fentanyl deaths soar as resources fail to keep pace scroll down warning: this graphic requires javascript. please enable javascript for the best experience.
yet there are some reasons to think expanding medicaid could stand a better chance of gaining wider acceptance than growing medicare, as my colleague colby itkowitz explained here. medicaid is a program run by states — something republicans favor — plus a number of gop governors have embraced medicaid expansion under the aca.
cms did not respond to a request for its view on iowa's new law.
the beautiful thing about a bilateral agreement is that if any one of the true parties in the agreement decides at any time they want to get out of the agreement, or they're not being treated fairly, they can renegotiate much easier. in a multinational agreement, that's not the case. in many cases, all of the other countries have to agree to an action or to let somebody out. that's not putting the u.s. interest's first.
ahh: biden has picked chiquita brooks-lasure to lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services.
so it's not -- it's not just other countries, but within existing trade deals, we can figure out is there a trade dispute that can be settled with the wto, is there a revision to one of the existing trade treaties that we have now? but there's a lot that can be done. there are things that congress can update to make sure that we're importing and exporting more to benefit american businesses.
they spent a year reinventing the wheel on opioid policy with things we already knew, said andrew kessler, a policy consultant who specializes in behavioral health. it's all been recommended before.
during trump's first months in office, the administration shunted aside its white house office of national drug control policy. the office, whose director is known as the drug czar, is responsible for coordinating anti-drug efforts across 16 federal agencies and producing the national drug control strategy, an annual drug policy plan mandated by congress.
the picture that was painted publicly is one of discussions that are moving further to the left, said dan holler, vice president of communications and government affairs at heritage action for america.
question: just admit(ph) -- you know, the senators(ph) were hooting and hollering --
meanwhile, paul mango, who served as deputy chief of staff, has started a consulting operation called jackson hole strategic advisors and has joined several boards, mango told dan.
last august, four cities sued the administration for undermining the act. the cities — baltimore, chicago, cincinnati and columbus, ohio — accused the administration of actively discouraging enrollment, raising rates and limiting health-care services.
i am sending the congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in american history.
-- rick scott blindsides desantis on his way out, by politico's marc caputo and matt dixon: the contentious handoff of the florida governor's office from scott to fellow republican ron desantis has cast a shadow over their relationship, raising questions about whether the two prominent swing-state republicans are on a collision course as a result of their future ambitions for the white house. tensions between the old governor and the new governor had been simmering under the surface for more than a month, but it burst into public view tuesday after scott abruptly left his successor's inauguration ceremony, leading desantis to ad lib the parts of his speech in which he planned to personally thank scott. … desantis loyalists were already miffed that scott's political committee decided to throw a ball in washington to celebrate his installation in the u.s. senate that overlapped with the traditional inaugural celebration for the governor in tallahassee. those slights followed two other perceived insults friday, when the governor made more than 70 appointments without consulting desantis.
question: i did, thank you for remembering.
blackstone mayor billy coleburn acted as an emcee, reading written questions collected from the crowd. asked do you deny climate change? brat said no, the climate changes all the time. his apparent attempt at levity angered the crowd, prompting some to yell answer the question!
words on signs that referenced women's anatomy were also blurred. one sign blurred the word vagina from a sign that originally read, if my vagina could shoot bullets, it'd be less regulated. another sign that read this pussy grabs back has the word pussy erased.
on receiving this news, megan's dad, john, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. he founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved megan's life. today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at notre dame.
we just haven't seen any move toward that end from the administration, she said.
james madison's solution was federalism, a division of power between the federal and state governments, including outsize influence for sparsely populated states — which would have as many senators as the most populous ones and disproportionate sway in the electoral college, which selected the president. together, these two branches populated the federal bench and the supreme court, further amplifying small states' influence.
northam quickly apologized but at a news conference on saturday, he reversed himself and said he was not in the photo and didn't know how it got on his yearbook page.
in his dec. 27 op-ed, urging president trump to respect the haters, gary abernathy utterly distorted the essence of the trump presidency. mr. trump, he says, should continue to drain the swamp, enforce immigration laws and criticize journalists but show respect. really? his apparent blindness to our president's chronic lying, justice obstruction, immorality, narcissistic impulsiveness, immigrant-bashing, press-attacking and acquiescence to authoritarian leaders places mr. abernathy among the alt-propagandists of the new alternate reality.
thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one is left out.
spicer: it is, but i think as i noted, john, it's very early in this process. we are at the beginning stages of this decision-making process and his team's gonna continue to consult with stakeholders as we get there.
at the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security. by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. we want all americans to succeed — but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. we must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.
actually, the system will work just fine — as it is supposed to under the constitution — if a democratic majority takes its oversight responsibilities seriously, in contrast to the gop-controlled house, which hasn't lifted a finger to stop president trump's conflicts of interest or his unconstitutional receipt of foreign emoluments, nor to demand that he disclose his tax returns (which every modern president has done). house republicans have not issued a single subpoena to investigate a plethora of financial concerns involving environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt, and they have not called on secretaries of treasury, interior or housing and urban development to testify under oath about their abuses of taxpayer funds.
another piece of evidence suggesting that trump and his aides want to do more for working-class taxpayers is that the white house is looking for a new direction on child care.
sessions used an emergency declaration to make all chemical variants of fentanyl, known as analogues, illegal on a temporary basis; congress must pass legislation to make the ban permanent. chinese and mexican chemists and drug traffickers in the united states had been evading the law by tweaking the chemical compounds that make up fentanyl and producing products that don't fit the precise chemical formula for a banned substance.
america is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. we want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
the group adopted a binding rule: 80 percent of its members could commit the entire caucus membership to vote together on a given proposal. within months, the group had roughly 40 members, enough to be pivotal on highly partisan votes.
we'll leave you with this exchange between ted cruz and deadspin:
thank you, guys. i appreciate it. this was a good first one.
question: ...what should their expectations be?
there's a bear in the woods:
democrats (and the media) bound them together: here's senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), who gave a speech urging his colleagues to confirm biden's win just an hour or so before rioters broke into the capitol: we just spent four years condemning democrats' shameful attempts on the validity of president trump's own election. … the media that is outraged today spent four years aiding and abetting democrats' attacks on our institutions after they lost.
as his colleagues have rolled out scores of different medicare-for-all-style bills, sen. brian schatz (d-hawaii) has proposed the state public option act, which would allow people to use obamacare subsidies to buy a medicaid-type plan offered in the individual marketplaces.
ex-cardinal theodore mccarrick could soon be defrocked after the vatican finished collecting evidence in his sexual abuse case. witnesses have testified in the past several weeks to american clergy about the alleged misconduct of mccarrick, a former archbishop of washington. (michelle boorstein, julie zauzmer and chico harlan) the archdiocese of chicago said the rev. c. john mccloskey was never officially restricted from ministering in the years after he was accused of sexual harassment. mccloskey's alleged victim, who received a $977,000 settlement from the catholic organization opus dei, said she was assured the priest would not be put in a position where he could potentially harass someone else. (julie zauzmer and michelle boorstein) the supreme court considered whether it should overturn a precedent decision in a case concerning whether one state could be sued in another state's courts. the justices' decision could indicate their future approach to respecting precedents, such as roe v. wade. (robert barnes) opposition candidate felix tshisekedi was declared the winner of congo's presidential election. the announcement, which comes almost two weeks after the election, clears the way for the country's first democratic transfer of power. (max bearak) some u.s. officials fear the growing power of iraq's shiite militias could fuel a resurgence of the islamic state. the militias' oversight of sunni areas they helped liberate from the islamic state has sparked complaints similar to those that helped power the extremist group's initial rise three years ago.
we now know that all of those promises have been broken.
getting democrats out of the freedom-vs.-government nonsensical argument would be a great contribution to buttigieg's party and to reasoned debate. it would force republicans to defend their policies on turf they are unfamiliar with: are they helping people or hurting them, advancing a shared common good or reducing us to the law of the jungle?
gop members are already annoyed by the costs of the coronavirus relief package, which democrats are moving using filibuster-proof legislation to avoid seeking any republican help. they've been arguing that much of the legislation isn't directly related to the pandemic, instead reflecting broader liberal priorities such as raising the minimum wage.
obamacare has failed -- harming patients and making it harder for families to make ends meet, health and human services secretary tom price wrote in a statement announcing actions the administration was taking in advance of a broader effort to reverse the harmful effects of obamacare.
switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class.
we have cleared the way for the construction of the keystone and dakota access pipelines — thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs — and i've issued a new directive that new american pipelines be made with american steel.
so for now, that's not - the focus is going to be on people who have done harm to our country.
question: ...and then on nafta, can you just clarify? i know he's going to meet with the leaders of mexico and canada. has he started to have discussions with them currently about renegotiating nafta...
question: i don't -- i don't mean to beat a dead horse on the issue of the u.s. embassy in israel.
news you can use if you live in d.c.:
-- trump also maintained that he has the absolute right to declare an emergency and construct the wall without congressional authorization. asked what his threshold will be for usurping legislative authority, he answered: my threshold will be if i can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.
finally, to keep america safe we must provide the men and women of the united states military with the tools they need to prevent war and –- if they must –- to fight and to win.
i think, look, you're seeing with respect to the other meetings, it's day one -- working day one here. he's gonna start with the leadership. he's gonna have a great conversation with them.

republican senators spoke to reporters before meeting with president trump on jan. 9, the 19th day of the partial government shutdown. (rhonda colvin, jorge ribas/the washington post)
— a few more good reads from the post and beyond:
(this is a frozen in time number that dates from 2013, indicating the increase in young adults with insurance before the rest of obamacare kicked in. the number of people without insurance in ages 19-25 has declined significantly since 2010, from 33.9 percent to 14.8 percent in 2018. but much of that improvement stems from other factors related to the law, not the provision that allows young adults to stay on parents' plans. the 2.3 million estimate, as we have noted in the past, is not universally accepted. a 2014 article in the new england journal of medicine calculated a figure of 1 million.)
i am going to bring back millions of jobs. protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. the current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.

are the words yes and no in your vocabulary? subryan yelled. then she added, you're full of s---!
and there's more evidence that trump hasn't prioritized protecting patients with preexisting conditions. back when congressional republicans tried to replace obamacare in 2017, they came up with plans that would have weakened those protections — which the president supported.
where has biden been lately? according to matt, he has spent the last week at home making calls to lawmakers and meeting with advisers, but has kept a relatively low public profile. some have criticized his absence over the past week amid a national crisis. his campaign announced 10 days ago that biden himself has not taken the test for the coronavirus because he has no symptoms and hasn't come into contact with anyone who has tested positive.

to launch our national rebuilding, i will be asking the congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the united states — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs.
conway said trump views his handling of the crisis as a legacy issue and continually asks her for updates about what is taking place in the states.
i just wanted to reiterate that one of the hardest things about this disease is he's in the hospital — he's been there a few days — and i can't even be by his side, klobuchar said on a previously scheduled conference call. i think many families in america are now experiencing this and things that are much, much worse.
the first month of pelosi's return to the speakership has thus far served as a pretty resounding affirmation of her leadership and political acumen. and wednesday epitomized it.
we passed va choice so they can see their doctor. our veterans were waiting online for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks. ... we passed va choice. you go out now, you get a doctor. you fix yourself up. the doctor sends us the bill. we pay for it. ... va choice for the veteran? they've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years.
question: (inaudible) first one, with the congressional meeting today and also at the retreat, you said talking about his legislative agenda. besides healthcare, can you give us one, two or three legislative things that he wants to get through right away? so not the executive actions, legislation.

grogan didn't obtain a waiver from complying with a directive the president established during his first week in office that would block lobbyists from regulating on a specific issue area in the administration for two years, david pittman reports. (the health 202 wrote about grogan back in november.) the administration insists grogan didn't need a waiver because his current role doesn't overlap with his former work with gilead sciences.
one sign of a death spiral would be fewer young adults, who tend to be healthier, signing up -- something that cox says hasn't happened. another protection against a death spiral is that roughly 85 percent of the people who buy insurance through the exchanges are insulated from premium increases by subsidies, she said.
let me begin by saying that the president has been closely monitoring the severe weather in the southeast. he spoke by phone with governor deal of georgia yesterday and offered his condolences and support. today, president trump is focused on fulfilling his pledge to pursue trade policies that put america first.
badlands national park tweeted out facts about climate change -- then they were deleted (see below). democratic lawmakers applauded the rogue ex-employee who posted them:
the murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.
-- back in 2013, right after the gop forced a shutdown in a failed effort to defund obamacare, trump criticized barack obama for allowing it to happen. the future president defined leadership this way. whatever happens, you're responsible, he tweeted five years ago. if it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
lawmakers in tennessee, alaska and oklahoma have already expressed an interest in pursuing block grants. supporters of block grants say the change would free states from federal requirements and give them more flexibility to try new ways to increase coverage and cut costs.
some details of the proposal are still being hashed out. but those involved say the plan will probably be released mid-june, and white house staffers have been briefed on it.
-- trump took to twitter last night to re-up the idea of dispatching federal law enforcement to chicago if local officials cannot curb the city's homicide rate on their own: if chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, trump wrote, i will send in the feds! he then cited homicide figures that appear to be from a newly published chicago tribune article. it is unclear what exactly trump's suggestion would entail, or what kind of unilateral government intervention he could order to remedy the problem — but following the tweet, a spokesman for chicago mayor rahm emanuel said he welcomed the prospect of working with trump, adding that the two men had previously spoken about the issue. (john wagner and mark berman)
question: (inaudible) ...now that he's officially in office, don't they...
that's as much why democrats aren't defecting, or more so, than the left's growing moral opposition to the very concept of walls. don't forget that trump couldn't get his wall money even when the gop had unified control of government during the past two years — when 10 senate democrats were up for reelection in states he had carried.
heather howard, a lecturer at princeton university who also helps states with their health-care systems, told colby that 14 states across the country have made moves to at least weigh the benefits and challenges of making medicaid widely available to higher-income earners.
the turnout was 64.1 percent — the third-highest for a referendum vote since the adoption of the constitution in 1937 and the decision to join the european economic community in 1972, our colleagues note. by comparison, turnout was just over 60 percent when ireland voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015.
trump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president's agenda, juliet eilperin and brady dennis report. the environmental protection agency as well as the agriculture and interior departments now have formal policies restricting what they should convey to the public about their work. … many new administrations — including former president barack obama's — have moved quickly to take control of the u.s. government's public relations machinery and centralize decision-making upon taking office. but the sweeping nature of some of the new controls is unusual.
a new national pride is sweeping across our nation.
the trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the central intelligence agency to reopen overseas 'black site' prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former president obama shut them down, the new york times's charlie savage reports. president trump's three-page draft order, titled 'detention and interrogation of enemy combatants' … would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that mr. obama put in place in response to policies of the bush administration. if mr. trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke mr. obama's directive to give the international committee of the red cross access to all wartime detainees in american custody — another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the geneva conventions….
together, they offer an unsettling picture of the administration's priorities, and suggest what a second trump term would bring. herewith, a necessarily incomplete roundup:
we will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.

-- billionaire democratic donor tom steyer announced he would not run for president. chelsea janes reports: steyer said he would instead continue with his campaign to impeach [trump], an effort that began in 2017, and on which he has already spent $10 million on television ads. … the former hedge fund manager said he will be hosting town halls across the country to discuss what he terms the dangers of trump's presidency. … steyer announced that he will invest $16 million going forward in efforts to 'deepen americans' understanding of trump's impeachable offenses.' he said he would focus those efforts on the constituents of the 22 republican senators up for reelection in 2020.
biden said he'll use the federal government's pharmacy program to prioritize k-12 teachers for vaccinations and will also call on states to prioritize educators. the president said that his goal is for every educator to receive at least a first dose of a vaccine by the end of march.
in our view, this bill helps finish the work of obamacare. it gives the american people a choice, bennet said.
trump has persuaded himself that the public will blame democrats for tanking the markets, thus forcing them to the table. but that is fanciful, because republicans currently control everything. if this strategy produces anything, it's most likely to be a set of compromises that would give both democrats and republicans some concessions while preserving and perhaps growing the aca's coverage expansion — which would be broadly unacceptable to many ideological conservatives, and would require trump to cut them loose.

this could strand many of the 12 million people who have gotten coverage on the individual markets, according to larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. they could be left with no insurers in the marketplaces, no way to get tax credits, no way to get coverage at all, levitt tells me, adding that the insurer exodus could also prevent people who individually obtain coverage outside the exchanges from doing so: you're talking about small business owners, farmers, self-employed people, early retirees — who would have no way of getting health insurance.

the measure, which is included in both the house and senate bills, would lower the amount of income people are expected to spend on monthly premiums.
the number of people who gained because of the medicaid expansion is a bit fuzzier and open to interpretation. there are 17.1 million in the expansion group for whom states are getting enhanced federal matching payments, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. there are 12.7 million who were made newly eligible. the reason the numbers are different is because some states had waivers pre-aca that included some of these enrollees.
that representational bias may partly explain why congress has often been willing to advance pro-business legislation even in the face of strong opposition from the public.

the first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.
the plan isn't likely to garner much — if any — attention from gop house and senate leaders, who after last year's repeal-and-replace debacle resigned themselves to the impossibility of fully ditching the law as they'd promised for so long. moderate republicans couldn't stomach dramatic medicaid cuts, and conservatives refused to vote for a replacement bill that left too much of the affordable care act intact.
— there was nary a mention of president trump's claims a day earlier that he championed protections for patients with preexisting conditions (read our health 202 fact-check here). the candidates mostly stuck to their own differences over expanding health coverage, which one could argue makes for a better debate but disappointed democratic activists who are primarily concerned with beating trump.

price said one way to cover people with preexisting conditions under an obamacare replacement would be to push them into high-risk pools, in which people with high medical costs are pooled together to avoid having their expenses drive up premiums for healthier consumers. that hasn't worked well in the past, providing costly coverage to limited numbers of people, the associated press notes.

the latest plan is being forged by leaders at the conservative think tanks heritage foundation and the galen institute, along with former senator rick santorum and yuval levin of the ethics and public policy center. they've been meeting regularly over the past eight months to craft a recommendation for congress to repeal much of the aca's coverage requirements and taxes, turn over some of its spending to states through block grants and expand the use of tax-free health savings accounts.
by the president's accounting, his accomplishments are legion. he boasts about his tax cuts — the biggest in history. he preens about his judges — a historic transformation of the judiciary — chosen to cater to the anti-choice passions of evangelical christians. he brags about slashing regulations. he says his wall is being built. he promises once more to trash obamacare and provide a much better alternative. he claims to still be avoiding endless wars. he champions his trade deals and his tariffs. and, of course, he takes — and gets — credit for the growing economy with low top-line unemployment.

the consensus among experts — including infectious disease expert anthony s. fauci and other senior officials on trump's coronavirus task force — is that restaurants, bars, schools, offices and other gathering places should remain closed for many more weeks to mitigate the outbreak, the worst effects of which are yet to be felt in the united states, our colleagues write. but trump has been chafing against that notion and impatient to get american life back to normal.
the majority party assigns a chairman for each of the senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. but when the senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its republican and democratic leaders -- trent lott of mississippi and tom daschle of south dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, equal budgets for committee republicans and democrats, and the ability of both leaders to advance legislation out of committees that are deadlocked. a similar power-sharing arrangement might be reached after jan. 20.

jimmy fallon scrutinized the opening line of trump's immigration address:
conservatives were also critical of the bill advanced last fall by sens. bill cassidy (r-la.) and lindsey graham (r-s.c.). they liked how it transferred obamacare's subsidies and medicaid expansion dollars to states, but feared states might still use the funds to expand government programs. the plan they're working on will probably include more rules for how states could use block grant funds, such as restricting states from maintaining an expanded medicaid program for able-bodied, childless adults.
trump will travel to the border for an immigration roundtable and a briefing on border security.
medicaid has also been the target of criticism and targeted changes from officials because it benefits those on the lower end of the income scale, offering services for americans earning only up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that threshold is lower in states that haven't expanded medicaid under the aca). shalala made this observation, too: fewer capitol hill staffers specialize in medicaid policy compared to medicare policy, since medicaid is run by the states.
why medicaid? schatz wrote in a usa today piece touting his bill. frankly, this program — already serving 69 million people — is underrated. it has a large provider network and the same ratings as private insurance but at a much lower cost to the government … medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.

when i read about his full-throated support for the repeal of obamacare, i could only wonder what his local subscribers think, based on the following two facts: ohio is second in the nation in drug overdose deaths and, in 2017, ohio was one of the main beneficiaries of obamacare. as noted in a february cincinnati enquirer article: the decline in the rate of uninsured was staggering: in 2008, 36.1 percent of the poorest ohioans had no health insurance. as of 2015, the number was 14.1 percent — nearly a 61 percent drop.

when you say this is an emergency, you would expect to hear what they plan to do about the emergency, said andrew kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at brandeis university. when president trump designated the opioid crisis a public health emergency, at the very same time, he should have said, 'here's what we're going to do about it,' and put out a detailed plan outlining what every federal agency was going to do.

the new document offers no information about how imports or exports would be taxed.
that same month, the white house proposed slashing medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which could further undercut drug treatment coverage nationwide.
pryor , 54, followed jeff sessions as alabama's attorney general, and thrilled supporters at his hearing by not backing away from a previous statement that the roe v. wade decision was a constitutional abomination. he has long been considered the front-runner for the job but lately has drawn fire from staunch conservatives for upholding the right of a transgender woman to sue over being fired.
he argued that, instead, it was necessary to talk about the value of drugs and to reexamine the role of middlemen between the drug company and the patient — such as pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate on behalf of insurance companies, wholesalers and pharmacists — which each take a cut of the price.
ron johnson ( wis. ) i am concerned about leader mcconnell's comments to apparently some of my republican colleagues — 'don't worry about some of the medicaid reforms, those are scheduled so far in the future they'll never take effect,' the conservative senator, who wants to roll back medicaid, told the greenbay press gazette in an interview published july 14. i've got to confirm those comments ... i think those comments are going to really put the motion to proceed in jeopardy, whether it's on my part or others. read more »
-- jerry brown seized on conway's alternative facts formulation during his state of the state address in california yesterday: the recent election and inauguration of a new president have shown deep divisions across america. we have seen the bald assertion of 'alternative facts.' we have heard the blatant attacks on science. familiar signposts of our democracy — truth, civility, working together — have been obscured or swept aside, the democratic governor said. let me be clear: we will defend everybody — every man, woman and child — who has come here and contributed to the well-being of our state. california is not turning back. not now. not ever. (katie zezima)
come saturday, this partial government shutdown is poised to become the longest in u.s. history. regardless of how or when it ends, the donnybrook will have illustrated trump's weaknesses. as a result, the public image of the president will probably fall more in line with these underlying political realities.
obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. as an example, arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. governor matt bevin of kentucky just said obamacare is failing in his state — it is unsustainable and collapsing.
question: (inaudible) three months ago then candidate trump was in gettysburg and he made a list of day one promises. he called it a contract with the american voters. a bunch of them are not gonna get done today because you said he's done with making executive orders; labeling china a currency manipulator and posing congressional term limits (inaudible). i wanted to ask you why not pursue all those on day one, as he promised in a contract with the voters?
it's possible the additional subsidies could persuade more people to buy plans than the cbo is estimating, especially considering that healthcare.gov is open for a special enrollment period because of the pandemic.
question: hey sean, i want to ask you two questions money (ph) related. the president campaigned on a corporate tax cut rate of 15 percent and today when he met with the business leaders, he had mentioned that the tax rate would drop to somewhere between 15 to 20 percent. is he moving the goalpost there in anyway? and my second question is on government spending, there have been reports that you might be looking at $10 trillion over the course of 10 years. is that accurate? and would you be willing to wrap up entitlements to get there?
spicer: well, i think - yeah, what the - what those people should know is that the president's laid out a list of priorities and the priorities are focused on making sure that people who can do harm or have done harm and have a criminal record are the focus. and as he said throughout the campaign, we've got a series of individuals who we've got to figure out. people who've overstayed their visas, people who have committed crime, and we're going to go through that in a very systematic and methodical way.
1. trump is particularly fond of making bold claims about how the veterans affairs mission act came about and what it did. he has claimed the legislation was all his idea. he has suggested congress couldn't get the measure approved for 44, 45 or even 48 years. he has made these claims — or iterations of them —113 times, according to the post database.
crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.
-- sadly, this is part of a broader trend. the ap reports that a wave of public officials – mostly male – have been reprimanded, called out, or disciplined over social media postings this week about the women's march protests. one indiana state rep posted a photo showing a women being sprayed in the face with pepper spray and a caption reading, participation trophies. now in liquid form. another suggested trump has already gotten more fat women out walking than michelle obama did in 8 years. and an illinois teacher was suspended after suggesting the protesters all had to go home to make dinner.
spicer: well, i think he is -- we're going to continue to sequence those out. i mean, part of it is to make sure that we don't spend our entire day signing executive orders and (inaudible). there's a way that we can do this to make sure that we're getting all of those things that he promised the american people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn't just jam them out in a fire hose.
2. how many americans are covered because of obamacare?
she pointed to her bill with sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) on drug importation as well as her bill to stop generic drugmakers from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market. the issue here is there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of congress, she said. they think they own washington. they don't own me.
texas gov. greg abbott's order to lift the state's mask requirement and increase the permitted capacity of all businesses to 100 percent prompted sharp criticism tuesday from health experts and government officials who deemed it irresponsible and premature, the post's erin cunningham, derek hawkins and paulina villegas report.
correction: this story has been updated to correct aetna chief executive mark bertolini's comment that aetna is the only insurer operating on the nebraska exchange. medica also offers insurance there. aetna said bertolini misspoke.
question: of all the policy, or actions that a president could have taken today, he chose to reinstate the (inaudible) policy. what message is sending here? does he see the elimination reduction of abortions as an american value? and also here at home, can full (ph) life american's expect him to put his signature that will defund planned parenthood.
the caucus soon became known for using hardball legislative tactics to achieve its goals. republican leaders who refused to make bills more conservative or to allow the caucus to offer floor amendments faced the likelihood that a coalition between the freedom caucus and house democrats would kill those bills or the procedural motions that brought them to the floor.
presidential candidates often promise to change policy with the stroke of a pen on day one of a new administration. such rhetoric implies that a flurry of executive orders issued immediately after inauguration — like the calendar leaves falling in an old movie — could quickly reverse the previous president's course.
the real big lie at the heart of the modern republican party is about public policy, not conspiracy theories. starting in the 1930s, republicans promised their voters the repeal of fdr's new deal. when the next republican president, dwight d. eisenhower, did nothing of the sort, the modern conservative movement emerged, furiously branding ike a traitor. when lbj enacted the great society, conservatives pledged that once elected, they would tear it all down — and never did. ronald reagan launched his political career by denouncing medicare as a direct path to socialism. if it passed, he warned, [we] are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in america when men were free. of course, as president, reagan left medicare largely intact.

president has said he gonna resin (ph) the executive orders from president obama that are unconstitutional, but will he maintain this executive order of borrowing anti-lgbt...
spicer: i -- i think if there's a way that we can combat isis with any country, whether it's russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we'll take it.
spicer: well, i think -- i think what it's gonna -- what we're doing -- we are going to smartly do this. i mean, let's be clear. part of it is to make sure that they have america's interests in what they're doing and who they are. so we're not gonna get together with people under guise of defeating isis if that's not truly their guise or if they're not -- so let's -- let's not take that too far. thank you.
in other words, the administration, unchastened, stands by and will continue to stand by trump's inaccuracies if they're in service to trump's policy goals.
but to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every american child.
some members of congress are more sympathetic to the cause than others. sen. roger wicker (r-miss.), who has been tracking the heritage-led effort, seemed to feel the plan might give congress another chance to repeal obamacare.
— health care didn't come up until midway through the two-hour debate, a notable shift from most of the previous debates, in which candidates vigorously debated medicare-for-all right out of the gate.
4. blocking regulations, including one to prevent plane crashes:
we want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like denisha.
service members are younger and healthier than the population on average, but infection outbreaks have interrupted operations on navy ships. the pentagon reports that 21 u.s. service members have died of coronavirus infections.
-- while trump's claims of voter fraud are certainly newsworthy, they are also a distraction from an aggressive effort by this new white house to quickly transform the government and dramatically change the direction of public policy in ways that will directly impact tens of millions of americans.
after the mob forced senators and staff into hiding for hours wednesday, loeffler emerged with a change in attitude. she addressed her colleagues when the senate reconvened and said she can't in good conscience challenge the electoral college results. she was one of several gop senators who reversed their positions.
yet the pandemic has also offered obamacare advocates a chance to tout the law's successes on its 10th anniversary yesterday.
even taking the lower number would more than double the percentage of the population who gained from obamacare. so it would be 7.7 percent, versus 3.3 percent or fewer making payments.
question: what -- no, i mean what's the overall unemployment...
-- president trump invited indian prime minister narendra modi to visit later this year, white house officials said on tuesday. the invite came during a phone call between the two leaders, in which trump told modi that the u.s. considers india a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world, and discussed cooperation in economy and defense. (ap)
caucus members also care about delivering what they think their constituents want. they often justify their tactics as ways to keep their campaign promises, as meadows did when he encouraged a possible shutdown in contrast with politicians who forget what they promised the american people. and caucus members have long believed that public conflict — like shutting down the federal government — is a strong negotiation tactic and a valuable way to show voters their commitment to policy.
some people are working two, three jobs just to get by. and to see money get wasted in washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes. and i think that that comes into your question, in overall spending as well. we've got to look at how we're spending the american people's tax money.
spicer: i'm pretty sure that reagan didn't have youtube, facebook, or the internet.
spicer: 10 were in our -- were in the travel going over. so, 10 out of 400, plus. question: but the people -- the people who(ph) were(ph) in the front row, so those were cia employees?
another reason this matters: sessions could wind up being the point man on the investigation into voter fraud that trump promised on twitter this morning. as matt zapotosky and sari horwitz note, sessions has in the past asserted that voter fraud exists, though he has declined to endorse trump's assertion that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election. 'i don't know what the president-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement,' sessions said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, asked point blank by sen. al franken (d-minn.) whether he agreed with trump. 'i would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it. and i do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during election cycles.' …
some of the career people there, respectfully, should be really excited to finally have an administration who cares enough to try to break the back of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history, conway said.
i also believe i'm somewhat different from some of the other democrats in the field. and i can't speak to obama, but i've been on fox news any number of times. i'll talk to anyone. and one friend of mine, whose mother is an avid fox [news] viewer, said that yang is the only democrat i would support because he is the only one who does not seem to be judging me. that is enough for us to get a critical mass of donald trump supporters to get around a solution that would dramatically improve their way of life. they can see it.
from now on, america will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears –-

spicer: it does. i think we will have a nomination within the next couple weeks. he continues to make that a priority of his.
— the pandemic could now define the battle for congress, in more dramatic ways than the impeachment storm, which now feels far in the rear view.
spicer: we have not triggered the trigger, hasn't happened. but again i think we have an existing relationships with many of the countries that were part of the 12 nation make up of tpp. and i think we're going to continue to explore how we can -- in some cases strengthen those relationships or look for bilateral agreements with nations that we didn't have one through tpp.
mccain's been sending us this signal for awhile now. months before his death, he wrote in his last memoir that he regretted not picking joseph lieberman, an independent senator, for his vice president. palin called that revelation a gut punch.
there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. they're generic drugs. but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up, warren said. so my view is, let's give them a little competition... this is a way to make markets work.
the occupational safety and health administration's failure to issue new rules about coronavirus safety that companies would have been required to follow left workers unsafe, the labor department's office of inspector general said in a new report. osha also performed significantly fewer workplace safety inspections during the pandemic despite receiving more complaints compared with the same period in 2019, the post's eli rosenberg reports.
earlier in the day, the president spoke with egyptian president el-sisi. they discussed ways to deepen the bilateral relationship and support egypt's fight against terrorists and bolster egypt's home- grown historic economic reform program. president trump underscored the united states remains strongly committed to the bilateral relationship, which has helped both countries overcome challenges in the region for decades. the president committed to working -- continuing to (inaudible) military assistance to egypt and working with egypt to ensure that assistance most effectively supports the egyptian military's fight against terrorism.
and so every one of these meetings that you saw happen at trump tower and then now, its all about you know, whether it's 2,000 or 20,000 jobs, that's -- that's the focus. it's making sure that we have -- that small businesses have greater opportunity to be successful.
in addition, presidents have other ways of changing the direction of government. even without issuing a formal directive by executive order or memorandum, presidents can institute important policies by, for example, instructing agency heads to issue guidelines. this is how the department of homeland security implemented obama's instruction to carry out parts of the dream act without congressional approval, through guidances known as delayed action for childhood arrivals (daca) and deferred action for parents of americans (dapa). dhs then prioritized the implementation of deportation of undocumented persons, later reversed by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit.
thus, the trump strategy — allow the aca to collapse, and profit — makes little sense. nothing further to the right than the gop plan can pass, because that would alienate still more moderate republicans. the only thing that could conceivably pass is something that would have democratic and moderate republican support, and thus would be more liberal than the gop plan. that should theoretically give democrats leverage to demand fixes to the aca on their terms — fixes designed to incentivize more enrollment to the markets and further expand medicaid in states that haven't opted in — even if trump is successful in sabotaging the individual markets.
between january and april 2018, an additional 10,017 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. amanda gray, 24, a psychology student from manhasset, n.y., was one of them.
if lawmakers and administration officials settle on a deal, they're hoping the package will move through the chambers quickly, although questions remained about how the house would address the legislation, since they're out of session and probably not likely to return all together to vote.
between may and august 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which cdc data is available. colton gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from peoria, ariz., was one of them.

we believe this path could get majority support in congress and show the american people that members understand their distress, they wrote. congressional republicans are right to worry about obamacare's problems. they would be wise to consider this plan as the true solution to the problems facing america under obamacare.
former south bend, indiana mayor pete buttigieg said his own plan to expand coverage is better than running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion bills.
jane schacter: the ruling is notable for its narrowness. the court was invited to issue a broad ruling shielding merchants who have religious objections to same-sex weddings — protecting them from delivering goods and services that religious liberty proponents claimed would be compelled speech in favor of same-sex marriage. there was a fierce argument about whether baking a cake is speech. had the court said it was, the key question would have been which other goods and services would count as compelled speech. what about flowers? linens? wedding venues?

purdue spokesman robert josephson criticized the massachusetts lawsuit, calling it part of a continuing effort to single out purdue for the opioid crisis, calling the idea that purdue had only tried to push high doses of oxycontin a fictional narrative.
the time for small thinking is over. the time for trivial fights is behind us.
question: welcome. question following on what she was asking about the tpp. you know, part of the thinking of tpp was to encircle china economically and i wonder if the president has thought a little bit about what kind of bilateral relationships in the region -- trade relationships would accomplish a similar goal, and secondly, i heard you talking about nafta and a trigger, but i didn't hear you say you had triggered the trigger.
that's the tally from the post's stellar fact-checking team, which in the administration's first 100 days started a database for analyzing, categorizing and tracking every suspect statement trump utters. at the request of readers, they kept it going.

christie, however, was growing frustrated with sessions's exclusive focus on law enforcement actions. he said he called the attorney general several times, inviting him to speak at the commission's public hearings. instead, sessions sent his deputy attorney general.
they resurrected their frequent pre-coronavirus messaging about the trump administration's constant bombardment of the law, most specifically its position that the entire measure is unconstitutional and should be struck down by the courts. pelosi asked the administration to reverse its position on the aca and to instead encourage the states still resisting medicaid expansion to accept it.
any idea when it might be submitted? rep. gerald e. connolly (d-va.) asked baum.
spicer: i think we're done with executive orders for the day. but as i always say, stand by. but we do not have any intention to have additional executive orders today. but i believe there could be some additional ones throughout the week on trade. and we'll have further updates for you on there.

trump reacted furiously and said the democrats would 'kill us' on health care, according to the four people, who requested anonymity to candidly describe the private meeting. the president then picked up the phone, called azar and put him on speakerphone in the middle of the meeting, josh and yasmeen write.
as he did on the campaign trail, trump then tied the epidemic — and his drug strategy — to immigration at the southern border.
by giving an address from the oval office, trump is doing something similar: asking america to trust him because he is the president. but the presidency is viewed as untrustworthy at least in part because trump holds the position. even trump's vice president can't argue that trump is viewed as untrustworthy, instead trying to argue, bizarrely, that concerns about the factual accuracy of trump's statements fall into a nebulous category of political debate and therefore not something that americans care about.
widespread vaccinations could herald the beginning of a gradual return to normal life. politico reports the centers for disease control and prevention is set to release guidelines on safe activities for people who have been fully vaccinated as soon as tomorrow. the guidance will recommend that vaccinated americans limit their social interactions to small gatherings in the home with other vaccinated individuals and that they continue to wear masks in public.

spicer: and it was reflected at the cia. i mean, they came there. they were so excited, there was 1,000 people that applied for 3,000 plus seats. and we ended up taking in 400 people. that doesn't sound like a huge feud. they were excited, they were clapping, they were cheering when he walked in.
so democrats may rely on multiple budget reconciliation bills to get partisan priorities passed. this type of legislation — requiring just a simple senate majority instead of the usual 60 votes — is the same way republicans tried to repeal obamacare back in 2017.
an explainer on why salmon is getting more expensive:
the republican nominee has led some to conclude that he intends a sweeping expansion of presidential authority. his rhetoric implies a muscular, almost unitary, presidency that would be at least as expansive as what historian arthur schlesinger jr. famously dubbed the imperial presidency — his critique of richard nixon's abuse of power in the era of watergate and vietnam.
spicer: no. no, look, i've been doing this a long time, you've been doing this too. i've never seen it like this, jim, i've never -- and again, i'm not looking to go back and forth, but you're asking for an explanation.
question: ...how does he reach out to them (ph)?

in 2016, about 10 million people were enrolled in the obamacare exchanges, according to u.s. government data.
inequality is at the root of america's existential crisis, kettl argues, and not only because it is higher here than in any of the world's other leading industrialized nations. income inequality among the states is growing, too, creating more polarization and more friction and rendering the united states a collection of states divided. with washington deadlocked, the states continue to go their own way in everything from infrastructure investments to obamacare implementation. their policy differences are increasingly driving the country apart.
during an oval office meeting with kenyan president uhuru kenyatta, president trump ignored reporters' questions about sen. john mccain (r-ariz.). (the washington post)

describing his plans for big spending during the pandemic and after, johnson said, it sounds like a new deal and all i can say is that, if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be — because that is what the times demand: a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis. he adds to these innovations more traditional thatcherite ideas such as efficient government, free trade and a moral foreign policy. we will build better and build greener, he said, but we will also build faster — by dispensing with much of the red tape and regulation that burden britain today.
the white house did not respond to a request for an explanation of mulvaney's math. it's possible that he's simply confused about how many people pay what are known as shared responsibility payments. on cnn's state of the union, he said, there were tens of millions of people who were paying a fine, paying a fee, rather than take obamacare.

when it comes to electing the president, the fact is that every vote does not count. this does not apply to any other elected position — the person who gets the most votes gets elected to office. the electoral college is an anachronism.
two bipartisan bills lawmakers passed in 2016 — one aimed at speeding the discovery of medical cures and another aimed at addiction — tossed a little more than $1 billion toward the problem. congress didn't provide any additional funding last fall after president trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, much to the chagrin of health advocates who have been highlighting major shortcomings in the health-care system's ability to help addicted americans.

the one-shot johnson & johnson vaccine, which does not need to be kept frozen, might be best for people who want to be immunized quickly or would have difficulty returning for a second shot, the cdc said. the agency cited people who move frequently or who live or work in homeless shelters or correctional facilities as good candidates for that shot.

second, it emphasized how the colorado anti-discrimination commission disparaged religion in handling this issue. here the court focused on derisive comments made about [masterpiece owner jack] phillips's beliefs by state officials and the fact that the state gave other bakers leeway to refuse to bake cakes based on what might be seen as nonreligious claims of conscience. the majority said that doing so violated the principle that neutral laws — in this case, anti-discrimination laws — cannot be applied with animus toward religion.

johnson & johnson's latest goal is to produce 94 million doses of its single-shot vaccine by the end of may. together with the pledged shots from pfizer and moderna — 200 million doses each of their two-shot vaccines — this should be more than enough for the estimated 260 million adults eligible for a vaccine.
the opioid overdose death rate, by then almost entirely fueled by illicit fentanyl, continued to climb. in 2017, fentanyl for the first time became the leading cause of overdose deaths in america.
-- the shutdown has sharply reduced the fda's food inspections. laurie mcginley and joel achenbach report: the agency, which oversees 80 percent of the food supply, has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, fda commissioner scott gottlieb said in an interview. he is working on a plan to bring inspectors back as early as next week to inspect facilities considered high-risk because they handle sensitive items such as seafood, soft cheese and vegetables, or have a history of problems.
this executive action ushers in a new era of u.s. trade policy in which the trump administration will pursue bilateral trade opportunities with allies around the globe. this is a strong signal that the trump administration wants free and fair trade throughout the world.
mike flynn has been allowed some freedom of movement as he awaits his sentencing:
spicer: well, i -- i think, on china, he understand what a big market that is for u.s. goods and services. when he met with the head of alibaba a couple of weeks, that -- that was part of the point. there's huge market issue there. but in many cases, it's -- it's not a two-way street.
for sessions, fentanyl could be met only by the kind of tough law-and-order tactics he deployed as a federal prosecutor in alabama during the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s. while a member of the u.s. senate for 20 years, sessions was one of the few lawmakers to rail against bipartisan efforts to roll back the harsh drug sentencing policies of that era.
if we are guided by the well-being of american citizens then i believe republicans and democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
at our meeting, i asked them, how are you doing, how is business? they said that it's good. i asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. they told me — without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it — that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. they said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
the breakfast was an opportunity for the president to hear directly from america's top business leaders about the challenges they're facing and take some suggestions about what policies and action can be taken to help them create jobs and grow our manufacturing base. the meeting included a really great exchange of ideas and the president has decided to reconvene the group in a month and then have them meet on a quarterly basis.
white house officials treated the drug czar's office as a backwater. they staffed it with political operatives who had little or no drug policy experience and installed a 24-year-old campaign worker as the deputy chief of staff. senior staffers with years of experience were sidelined. in may 2017, the administration proposed cutting the office's budget by 95 percent.
— in a dungeon-like jail in the center of this depressed farming town, 18 women in orange-and-white-striped prison uniforms are crammed into a two-story cellblock. many of them are withdrawing from fentanyl.
question: well, i don't want to get into numbers. i -- i --
in may, the company began selling a half-priced version of humalog called insulin lispro.
spicer: i -- i -- there's a reason you go through a decision making process. and that's what we're in the process of starting right now. so, i just don't want to get ahead of -- it would -- if it was already a decision, then we wouldn't be going through a process.
in today's hyperpartisan politics, accusations of overly expansive presidencies fly across the aisle as a matter of course. a strong presidency is one who is of your own party and an imperial presidency is one from the other side, rudalevige said.
in late 2018, when it appeared that congress would wrap up its business without funding a southern border wall, meadows and other caucus members were able to leverage their white house ties and push for what became the longest federal government shutdown in american history.
spicer: i -- i -- i -- all i can do is tell you to listen to the tape alone. i think you can hear a lot of that. yes?
-- karen tumulty explains why trump is being short-sighted: trump allies — and adversaries — had hoped that with his inauguration, he would leave behind the hyperbolic reality-show culture that made him a celebrity. in the late stages of his presidential campaign, trump had disavowed his years-long promotion of the racially tainted falsehood that barack obama … was born outside the united states and therefore an illegitimate president. but the first days of his presidency show that, for trump, old reflexes are hard to break. veterans of previous white houses say they can recall no precedent for what trump and his top aides are doing [and] worry about the implications of this untethering from the truth … 'i don't think he realizes how much he is hurting himself,' [said former bush strategist matthew dowd]. then again, trump may well believe that this is the style which brought him to the white house, in defiance of every expectation. americans knew what they were getting when they elected him.
for too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.
several nights a week, christine birhanzl drives the streets of hamilton, a former paper and steel mill town in southwestern ohio, handing out blankets, food and clothes to addicts.
spicer: well, look, we're here on working day one. we're excited that prime minister may is coming on friday. we look forward to it. i'm sure that there will be a discussion of trade will come up, the degree to which i don't know yet and i'm sure we'll have an opportunity to brief you out. i don't believe we have any plans right now for a joint press conference, but that's something that our team will be working out with prime minister may and we'll keep you updated on that. yeah?
the vast social-distancing project of the last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good. warnings about large gatherings of more than 10 people and limiting access to nursing homes will save lives, the board wrote.  … yet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don't mean federal spending. we mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn't true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.
we've got to solve the underlying problem, cruz said. in my view we must, number one, honor our commitment to repeal obamacare and, number two, implement reforms that lower premiums.
hud's failure to enforce its environmental standards contributed to children living in lead-contaminated housing.
poor women in sub-saharan africa stand to be the biggest losers from trump's order, our kevin sieff reports from nairobi: in practice, experts say, that policy will freeze millions of dollars in funding that has gone to critical health treatment, including hiv testing and neonatal care. the united states does not fund any abortion services overseas, but many health groups receive american assistance to provide other women's services, while using different funding sources to provide abortion counseling and procedures. now, those organizations will have to stop providing abortion services if they want to continue to receive u.s. aid for their other programs. the policy is known as the 'global gag rule' because it even restricts references to abortion in counseling sessions….
question: 2016 was the hottest year on record and the last three years have been the hottest three years on record. scientists are saying that we're getting dangerously close to the point where human civilization is being threatened. how does president trump plan to address this?
in 2017, the first year of the trump presidency, a record 28,869 people died from synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, a 46.4 percent increase from the year before. most were from fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. estimates for the first eight months of 2018, the most recent available, show that an additional 20,537 americans died — a toll on pace to exceed the previous year's.
will there be a detailed discussion when prime minister may comes on friday on the potential parameters of what have a trade deal might look like? is there going to be a joint news conference? and is donald trump going to get a state (ph) visit back to the u.k. later in the year?
and over and over again, the mlk bust. i think over and over again there's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents. and it's frustrating for not just him, but i think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out. and so i mentioned this to john, part of this is a two- way street. we want to have a healthy dialogue, not just with you but the american people because he's fighting for jobs, he's fighting to make this country safer.
spicer: i think he reaches out to them in a way that he started on the night that he won the election, on the way that he did on inauguration day by sending a message that talks about fighting for them. but more importantly, i think the president's going to show through action and through success that he's fighting for them and fighting for every american. one of the things that we've seen so often in this town is a lot of soaring rhetoric about how much people care.
on sunday, president trump said he'd support remote voting. top house democrats have privately floated it, our colleague amber phillips writes. in the senate, there's a new bipartisan proposal to vote remotely for up to 30 days. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) has endorsed the idea for an emergency.
baltimore's penn-north metro station sits in a section of the city known for heavy trafficking of heroin and fentanyl. baltimore has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the united states, according to cdc data.
spicer: well, again, i -- i think when he talks to prime minister may, he's gonna have a great conversation about the potential for greater trade with the u.k. i mentioned earlier when he met with these manufacturers this morning, that was, you know, right up there at the top of that list, how can we get greater market access? what are the specific challenges that these manufacturers are facing getting market access in the countries around the globe? and that's an important issue.
-- jeff weaver, who ran sen. bernie sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, will take on a diminished role if the vermont senator runs again. david weigel reports: sources said the decision was made months earlier, long before a group of former campaign staffers asked for a meeting to create a new sexual harassment policy ahead of any 2020 decisions, asking in a letter for sanders to '[hire] diverse leadership to preempt the possibility of replicating the predatory culture for the first campaign.' weaver, 53, has worked closely with [sanders] for much of the senator's career. he first helped sanders as the driver for his unsuccessful 1986 bid for governor; in 2016, he helped build a long-shot campaign into a powerhouse that broke small-dollar fundraising records and won 23 primaries or caucuses.
the passion you hear from president trump, his determination to take this case to the american people as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the oval office, comes from his deep desire to do his job to protect the american people, pence told karl later in the interview — after reiterating the debunked statistic about terrorists trying to enter the united states that karl himself presented as an example of trump's misleading rhetoric. [w]e're going to continue to carry that case forward until the democrats in congress come to the table and start negotiating not just to end the government shutdown but to end what is an undeniable crisis at our southern border.
the white house counsel's office was down to fewer than 20 lawyers late last year, compared with 40 to 50 in past administrations: since his arrival in december, cipollone has increased the staff to roughly 35 lawyer and aims to bolster the ranks to 40 in the coming weeks … he also hired three deputies, all with extensive experience in past republican white houses and the justice department. … cipollone first met trump when fox news commentator laura ingraham, a close friend, recommended him to help prepare the then-candidate for the 2016 presidential debates.
think about how racially charged that is. and someone rushes out and says to the entire press corps that the president of the united states has removed the bust from his office. do you -- i mean, think about what the signal -- hold on, please.
freedom in republicans' description can often be a rationalization for widening inequality and refusing to protect americans from dangers to health and safety. we might be maximizing ivanka trump's and jared kushner's freedom with huge tax cuts, but for the rest of americans, the massive tax cuts for the rich or rollback on workplace safety or proposing to cut funds for the special olympics (how do these people sleep at night?) don't look like freedom.
but a deal will be made for good health care in this country. that's one of the things i'll be doing, he added.

wolf-sized otters prowled prehistoric china. the new species was described for the first time this week in the journal of systematic paleontology, based on remains uncovered at a fossil-rich mine in northern china. the cleveland museum of natural history produced a video on the find:
it is precisely because we need a party willing to exercise its oversight responsibilities, including the subpoena power, that ending republicans' majority is a critical corrective action to restore democratic norms. ryan has it backwards: the system — of constitutional government and checks and balances — is currently shut down thanks to republicans, who time and again have put party before country.

we have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.
the problem is obamacare has just collapsed, said brat, who stood at a podium in the blackstone herb cottage, a restaurant and event space. the crowd shouted in response, no, it has not!

here are trump's top five misleading health-care claims, in order of how frequently he has repeated them:
— the irish backed overturning the country's abortion prohibition late last week in a landslide vote that reflects ireland's emergence as a socially liberal country no longer obedient to catholic dictates, the post's william booth and isaac stanley-becker report. with all ballots counted and turnout at a near-historic high, election officials reported saturday that 66.4 percent voted to legalize abortion and 33.6 percent opposed it.
spicer: ok, i'm asking where was that apology? and so, i'm just saying that when you -- when things like that happen, when john lewis says that he's never missed an inauguration and we find out actually he did, under -- he skipped george w. bush's, that there are points in which we have a right to make sure that we correct the record.
the pollsters offered four ways of changing the health-care system to expand coverage, including medicare-for-all (which they described as having a national health plan … in which all americans would get their insurance from a single government plan). a majority of americans viewed the idea favorably to some extent — but it also had the most and strongest opposition.
spicer: oh, i'm sorry. look, the presidents a very successful businessman and negotiator. he's going to sit down and work with congress to get the best deal possible for american businesses so that they can hire more people and we expend - and we can grow the economy. so he's going to work with congress on that rate but he understand better than anybody how to negotiate a great deal. and right now he's going to negotiate the best deal on behalf of the american worker and on behalf of the american businesses that are hiring them. that was a lot of the focus that went on today, talking to these companies. and it was interesting, the meeting was only supposed to last an hour, it overflowed another hour in the oval office and he kept asking them what ideas do you have to grow this economy? what is preventing you from hiring people?
it's also feasible that more people entering the marketplaces could help insurers lower premiums in subsequent years.
johns hopkins university virologist andrew pekosz compared such viruses to particularly destructive burglars, our colleagues write. they break into your home, eat your food and use your furniture and have 10,000 babies. 'and then they leave the place trashed,' he said.
and two fact-checks for spicer. first, from the author of a study he cited to falsely claim widespread voter fraud:
but i also think we are here on the first working day. we're announcing theresa may coming this friday. we're excited to have the prime minister here. as i said, we already talking about setting up a meeting with canada and mexico. he's talked to prime minister netanyahu about having him come over. and then as i mentioned, president el-sisi.
after a day of partisan rancor and posturing on capitol hill, the outlook grew markedly more positive later in the afternoon, when offers and counteroffers were exchanged, our colleagues erica werner, paul kane, rachael bade and mike debonis report. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) convened democrats on a conference call and told them he was hopeful about striking a deal by the end of the day.
sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) follows the same strategy today. his 2016 platform included promises to repeal obamacare, abolish the irs and balance the budget — plans that he knew could never get enacted but were just the right red meat for the base. he treats his supporters like cannon fodder, whipping them into hysteria and sending them into battle.
republicans lost the other race that same day. under the trump era, the party has lost the house of representatives, the white house and the senate.
the impeachment process has run its course. the bad policies of this administration continue.
trump has also been checked by the courts on immigration as much as any other issue, including by gop-appointed judges, and his threat to claim emergency powers to build the wall would face certain legal challenges.
on the daca piece. i think the president has been clear that he was going to prioritize the areas of dealing with the immigration system, both building the wall and making sure that we address people who are in this country illegally. first and foremost, the president's been very, very clear. that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record - a criminal record or oppose a threat to the american people. that's where the priorities going to be and then we're going to continue to work through the entire number of folks that are here illegally. but right now the clear focus is on that.
the idea of repealing section 230 of the communications decency act, a provision that trump and his acolytes — such as sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) — have repeatedly railed against, could very well lead to increased scrutiny of right-wingers on the internet. now, under the law, social media companies aren't treated as traditional publishers, thus they are offered protection from lawsuits related to content posted by their users and leeway to make good faith efforts at restricting content they deem obscene, violent or harassing. removing section 230 could increase the chances that these companies would be exposed to greater liability, potentially motivating them to more tightly restrict content that defames, incites or otherwise violates laws that apply to traditional media such as newspapers.
spicer: well i think first, well i'll take the other one first on entitlements - or on spending. look, i think you saw this with the hiring freeze. there's been frankly, to some degree, a lack of respect for tax payer dollars in this town for a long time and i think what the presidents showing through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today, is that we've got to respect the american tax payer. they're sending us a ton of money, they're working real hard.
-- a dhs test of a steel slat prototype of the wall showed it could be sawed through. nbc news's jacob soboroff and julia ainsley report: the trump administration directed the construction of eight steel and concrete prototype walls that were built in otay mesa, california, just across the border from tijuana, mexico. trump inspected the prototypes in march 2018. he has now settled on a steel slat, or steel bollard, design for the proposed border barrier additions. steel bollard fencing has been used under previous administrations. however, testing by dhs in late 2017 showed all eight prototypes, including the steel slats, were vulnerable to breaching, according to an internal february 2018 u.s. customs and border protection report.
despite congressional republicans' failure last year to repeal much of the sprawling 2010 health-care law, the recent moves by both the federal government and gop states are nevertheless chipping away at a central goal of the democrats who created it: fostering comprehensive coverage nationwide for people without access to affordable health benefits through a job, while prohibiting insurance industry practices that often had put health plans out of reach for individuals with prior or current medical problems.
cummings also was furious that the white house had not produced its national drug control strategy to congress. it was two years past the congressionally required deadline. instead of submitting a strategy that normally consisted of more than 100 pages of detailed plans, carroll had given the committee what cummings called a 23-page pamphlet that did not outline specific goals or measurable objectives. at the hearing, triana mcneil, a director of the government accountability office, said the document failed to meet congressional requirements.
and i think it's not a question about a mandate and it's also not about forcing anything, it's about what's doing the right thing. it's about providing people what they've been promised. which is, you -- you go around this country and you look market after market, they're down to one plan. that's not what the american people were promised.
another member, bertha madras, said she was proud of the work. while she understood the importance of getting buy-in from the federal agencies, she was frustrated by the amount of time it took. the commission had to wait several months for officials to respond to the recommendations before the report could be issued, she said.
plenty of politicians have pledged wholesale, game-changing shifts in policy, but trump's hot rhetoric stands out because his promises are rarely accompanied by details on how he might implement his initiatives. he doesn't say how he might punish companies that ship jobs overseas, or how he'd get mexico to pay for a border wall, or how he would impose a ban on muslims entering the country. he says he will make it happen, believe me.
question: so (ph) you're not gonna renegotiate, to be clear...
for instance, one of its early goals was to eliminate the export-import bank, the federal government corporation that facilitates u.s. exports. it viewed the bank as wasteful corporate welfare. the group had too few members to block the bank's reauthorization on its own. so, the caucus worked with the chairman of the financial services committee, who refused to pass the reauthorization bill out of committee, and the bank's authorization expired. a cross-party coalition of lawmakers had to use a special house procedure to bypass the caucus and the committee and eventually reauthorize the bank.
although the big national insurers are large companies, they haven't been the biggest players in the exchanges, where 9.2 million people signed up through healthcare.gov. at the end of january, aetna reported 240,000 members through its state exchanges in delaware, iowa, nebraska and virginia. humana, which is pulling out of all the exchanges next year, insures about 150,000 people through its state exchanges.

1. who controls a 50-50 senate?
this isn't an uncommon pattern in presidential politics: in an effort to secure support from primary voters, who tend to be more politically extreme, candidates espouse positions that are further from center. the challenge, though, is that candidates might become committed to positions that become liabilities with the necessarily more-moderate electorate that votes in the general.
yet some conservative thinkers have argued while reducing rates could be beneficial, they are already very low by historical standards, and other changes to the tax system might be more important for growth. the document published wednesday does not discuss these new ideas, such as helping taxpayers and firms recover the costs of new investments.
certainly rhetorically, trump's idea that 'i alone can fix this' does go beyond the template that president obama and president bush before him came in with, the idea that you try to fix things together, said andrew rudalevige, a professor of government at bowdoin college.

president trump has taken a number of steps to confront the crisis, stem the flow of fentanyl into the country from china and mexico, and step up prosecutions of traffickers. congress also has increased spending on drug treatment.
finally, the president issued a memorandum outlining executive branch hiring. this memorandum counters through dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years. in particular, it prevents filling vacant positions and creating new positions except when necessary to meet national or public security responsibilities. it does not apply to military personnel and it ensures that the american taxpayers get effective and efficient government.

3. the president has another favorite overstatement related to veterans' health care: that a june 2017 measure he signed allowed underperforming va workers to be fired for the first time ever.
abortion-rights supporters have made recent moves to push for state-based laws protecting access to abortion and expanding access to birth control and reproductive care. the intensified efforts are a response to the addition of conservative brett m. kavanaugh to the supreme court, prompting concerns the new conservative majority would reverse roe v. wade. in new york, where democrats won full control of the state government in november, the first measure of 2019 expanding abortion rights was enacted. other efforts are underway in rhode island and new mexico, annie and ariana write.
question: before i get to a policy question, just a question about the nature of your job.
and i think that for those people around him, his senior team especially, but so many of the other folks that are either here in the administration, that gave up their time during the transition, they left a job to work for three or four weeks because they are so committed to having his nominees get through, it's a little demoralizing to turn on the tv day after day and hear, can't do this, this guy's not going to get confirmed, not way they're going to go through.
if you did something like eliminated coverage for everyone, that would not certainly be positive, unless it's replaced with something that provided equal or more coverage, said giroir, senior opioid adviser to the secretary of the department of health and human services.
we've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of chicago, baltimore, detroit — and so many other places throughout our land.
a week later, trump mentioned fentanyl publicly for the first time as president; he had been in office for nine months. trump also took christie's advice by declaring the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency — a step obama officials had decided not to take in may 2016, when health policy experts asked for the declaration for fentanyl.
in that context, this new $6 billion infusion is the best indication yet that lawmakers and policy wonks are serious about making opioid abuse a top issue.
the military mandates that service members receive a variety of vaccinations at enlistment, but commanders are restricted in requiring the use of the moderna and pfizer-biontech coronavirus vaccines, which have received emergency use authorization from the food and drug administration but have not received the standard fda approval.
but devins has concluded that the record of the past two decades shows that congress lacks both the will and the way to check the presidency.
the exact nature of how that's described, i don't -- but it is, there is a trigger within nafta, one of the sections allows the -- the president of the united states to notify them that we intend to do that.
trump told azar he's not getting it done, and that he needs to hurry up to lower drug prices and to allow for cheaper drugs to be imported from canada.
u.s. public opinion of the law was mostly negative from its passage in march 2010 until trump became president and sought to repeal it, according to tracking surveys by the kaiser family foundation. the threat of elimination – which failed when the late senator john mccain of arizona gave a memorable thumbs down in an early morning vote -- put a spotlight on popular provisions of the law, notably its prohibition on insurers charging sick people more for coverage and its list of essential health benefits, like hospitalization and maternity care, that must be covered. kaiser's tracking survey found in october that 55% of americans viewed the law favorably, while 37% viewed it unfavorably.

plus, the cost of the provision is flying under the radar amid the broader debate in congress over the $1.9 trillion relief package.
the law says such plans sponsored by a nonprofit agricultural organization . . . shall be deemed not to be insurance. that means they will be allowed to avoid both federal and state insurance regulations.
today, federalism, the bargain that made the united states possible, is threatening to tear it apart. donald trump is president despite losing the popular vote and remains in office because of the unequivocal support of a group of senators representing a minority of the federation's population. the same senate majority denied the last president a supreme court pick, ensuring a lasting conservative lock on the highest court in a country where conservatives are not a majority. demographic trends will make this counter-majoritarian balance of power worse with each passing year, creating a crisis of democratic legitimacy in a country that once saw itself as the world's model democracy.
we should have done more to push back, both against his rhetoric and some of the things he did legislatively, one republican senator told the hill on the condition of anonymity.
the president tweeted over the weekend calling the compounds a possible game-changer. but his own lieutenants, the heads of the food and drug administration and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, have been hesitant, stat news's matthew harper reports
that american workers can have their wages lifted up, that the benefits that they receive in terms of healthcare and education are something that -- that provide them the support that they need. but that's what this is all about.
lawmakers on capitol hill were growing impatient with the administration's lack of plans to confront the opioid epidemic. on july 26, the house oversight and reform committee summoned then-acting drug czar richard baum, who had been in his job for four months, to explain why he had not submitted a comprehensive plan to operate and fund the office.
i can't even imagine a world like that, said greta mayer, who runs the mental health & recovery board of clark, greene and madison counties in ohio. all of what we've gained would be lost.
he is -- you know, he's someone who really enjoys that kind of conversation. i think you're gonna see a lot of meetings occur like the ones that you did today, the business leaders coming in, these union workers.
so trump is incorrect when he says congress passed choice under his watch — that credit goes to obama.
question: he still plans to (inaudible) that day one list, though?
i know jonathan's (ph) a stickler for that.
another approach would be what trump has described a reciprocal tax, which would aim to match taxes imposed on certain goods in different countries around the world with some corresponding tax in the united states.
in the senate, minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has finally drawn the line, describing greene's views as loony. but it is too little, too late. the party has been encouraging loony views for years. today we rightly laud sen. mitt romney (r-utah) for his political courage — but it's worth recalling that when he was running for president in 2012, he craved donald trump's endorsement. when romney got it, he gushed, there are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life. later that year, he tacitly endorsed trump's most noxious lie — birtherism — joking that no one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
but once you subject this strategy to a moment's scrutiny, it becomes obvious that it will not bring about the result trump wants. indeed, the thinking here reflects a resolute refusal to appreciate an important reason the repeal effort melted down in the first place.

not all people file tax returns, so the denominator for the 3.3 percent is too small, he said. not every person on a tax return on which somebody paid the mandate penalty paid the penalty themselves. he added that he suspected the typical tax unit in which somebody paid a mandate penalty is smaller than average, in which case the 3.3 percent of tax returns would correspond to a smaller fraction of the total population.
minnesota gov. mark dayton said he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. the news comes just hours after he fainted during his state of the state address, setting off alarm bells and prompting questions about his health, though he recovered shortly after. in a news conference, dayton said he had planned to disclose the cancer next week after further tests and visits with his doctor. i don't expect it to impede my performance or responsibilities, he said, but i'll know more next week.

on sept. 1, trump nominated rep. tom marino (r-pa.) to be his first permanent white house drug czar. marino, a former prosecutor, had been one of trump's earliest and most ardent supporters in congress.
— and here are a few more good reads:
indeed, cruz sounds much more diplomatic these days. he said monday that a lot of work remains, but the talks in a working group that he started earlier this year with sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) have been productive.

jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. jamiel shaw jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. but he never got the chance. his father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.

rep. dave brat (r-va.), who drew national notice after complaining that women were in my grill because he was reluctant to hold a town hall meeting, finally relented and came face to face with those women — and plenty others — at a raucous public event tuesday night.
i don't -- i don't think that there's any question about that.
the next few weeks are crucial in determining whether the outbreak announced in may can be brought under control, according to the world health organization, saleh writes. complicating factors include its spread to a major city, that health workers are among those infected and the existence of three or four 'separate epicenters,' making finding and monitoring the contacts of infected people more difficult.
spicer: i think -- look the president has made it clear that he's going to work with congress to -- and part of the discussion that he's going to have tonight with some of these leaders, and then again with paul ryan, is how we can work to implement the -- both the repeal and the replace aspects of this.
-- potus is beginning his term at the helm of a stable but sluggish economy – but an increasingly ominous explosion in debt and deficit is looming in the very near future. a new report from the congressional budget office says the spending growth rate is set to outpace the rate of revenue growth after 2019, causing the deficit to explode to $1.4 trillion by the end of the decade. and, if current policies go unchanged, the cbo estimates public debt will soar to the highest rates since the period following world war ii.
what he said next overshadowed his other remarks.
the coverage expansions wouldn't last, either. unless congress extended the timeline, the subsidies would return to current levels after two years. by 2023, the uninsured rate would return to current levels, the cbo said.

archives spokeswoman miriam kleiman said the changes were made because the museum hosts young people and the messages could be deemed inappropriate and because, as non-partisan federal agency, the archives was trying to stay away from political controversy.

it's not just a number to him, it's about -- it's someone getting by, are their wages going up, can they find a better job, do they have access to education, whether its higher education, college or a votechnical -- a votech kind of school, so that they can train for the skills of the next century.
-- treasury secretary steve mnuchin, who will deliver a briefing today to house members on his decision to lift sanctions on companies linked to a russian oligarch, is attracting more scrutiny from house democrats. nbc news's heidi przybyla reports: mnuchin … has largely escaped investigative scrutiny. but because of his role in the campaign — and, most recently, the dec. 19 announcement easing sanctions on companies aligned with oleg deripaska, the putin ally with ties to former trump campaign chairman paul manafort — house democrats believe mnuchin should be a focus of and source of information for several planned investigations both related and unrelated to the russia probe, according to the aides. these include examinations of trump's finances and the business practices of the trump organization.
it can't all be gloom and doom. you can't just have the negative, harrowing, so-sad statistics of grief and loss and devastation. we have to start talking about solutions, she said. the battleship is starting to turn in the other direction.
in a bill-signing ceremony at the state capitol in des moines, the governor contended that iowa's individual insurance market had ample choices and reasonable premiums before the aca left it in collapse. after urging congress to fix this problem, reynolds recounted monday, she decided we are done waiting and urged state lawmakers to find their own solution. that is exactly what they did.
spicer: i don't believe he has spoken to anyone specifically about that and i don't know that -- he has not made any indication that he would stop an investigation of any sort.
but health policy experts argue that, so far, there aren't clear signs that bertolini's assessment is accurate. cynthia cox, associate director of a program focused on health reform and private insurance at the kaiser family foundation said that in a true death spiral, the people buying insurance on the exchanges should be a progressively sicker group of people each year. although the people buying insurance have been sicker than insurers projected, cox said there isn't evidence that the pool of people is getting sicker.
the white house drug czar's office was still leaderless when christie's commission issued its report in november 2017. a few weeks later, trump named conway, a former republican party pollster, to be his point person on the opioid epidemic. a highly skilled political operative with no drug policy experience, conway was now in charge of coordinating the government's response to the epidemic.
criticism of international trade was paramount in trump's appeal to voters, but the document released wednesday does not answer basic questions about whether he would address this issue in terms of taxes.
question: two questions, the national security council -- sacking (ph) of the national security council, when do you expect to have that -- those positions filled?
currently, households do not pay taxes on a certain minimum amount of income, depending on size and family status. during the campaign, trump proposed exempting households from paying taxes on their first $15,000 in income, regardless of the type or size of the household. he also proposed bringing the minimum marginal rate that ordinary households pay on their income up from 10 percent to 12 percent.
by 2004, george w. bush could state that when congress wouldn't act, he had no choice but to issue an executive order expanding access to federal grants for faith-based charities. obama similarly said in 2014 that when congress doesn't move on things they should move on,... i've got a pen and i've got a phone, and i can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.
his greatest looming challenge will be presiding over ongoing investigations whose dimensions and direction are unclear. those alleged entanglements continue to expand, matt, ellen and greg write. u.s. officials said this week that the fbi has scrutinized communications between trump's national security adviser, lt. gen. michael t. flynn, and russian ambassador sergey kislyak. … u.s. officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said they have seen no evidence of wrongdoing. … the fbi for several months has been investigating allegations that trump associates or acquaintances, including his former campaign manager paul manafort, might have had improper contact with russian officials or intermediaries, u.s. officials said. the bureau is also still examining allegations in the dossier that comey discussed with trump in new york last month, according to a u.s. official.
and streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.
lisa murkowski ( alaska ) the moderate senator said in a facebook town hall there were some good things that came out of [obamacare], like protecting coverage for young adults and people with preexisting conditions as well as expanding medicaid. it's no secret that healthcare needs to be reformed, but it needs to be done right, she said in a june 22 statement. read more »
the party endlessly crowed about repealing and replacing obamacare, only to come to power without a viable plan and then quickly accommodate itself to the reality it had vowed to overturn. this strategy has led millions of republicans to feel cheated and lied to by their leaders, creating an atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion toward anyone who is not utterly extreme. it also feeds the notion that true conservatism fails because of some kind of collusion, treason and betrayal. it is a short and direct line from gingrich to the jan. 6 capitol riot.
ahh: senate leaders and the trump administration appeared near a bipartisan deal last night on a massive stimulus package to bolster the economy with $2 trillion amid the coronavirus fallout.
that relationship grew stronger when trump appointed rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), a caucus co-founder, as his budget director and then as his acting chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in the white house.
welcome to the daily 202, powerpost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
the list goes on. the interior department is poised to weaken protections for millions of migratory birds, saying companies whose industrial activities kill birds accidentally should not be subjected to fines or prosecution. the department of housing and urban development is rolling back another obama-era rule designed to press cities to do more to combat racial segregation in housing. the agriculture department moved to tighten eligibility for food stamps in a way that the administration itself estimated would eliminate nearly 700,000 of the poorest adults from the rolls.

-- the wizards beat the celtics 123-108.
but i think that this is -- this is not a deal that was in our country's best interest. the president could have come into office -- a president could have come into office and renegotiated it and sent people back to the drawing board. it hadn't gone to congress yet because it wasn't finalized. i think this president pulling out of the agreement is not just about this one agreement, but i think it's symbolic both here in america and around the world of a new era of trade policy, one that's going to put american workers first and foremost and one that assures the rest of the world that the way that we negotiate bilateral agreements is going to ensure that we get something out of these deals.
between january and april 2018, an additional 10,017 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. amanda gray, 24, a psychology student from manhasset, n.y., was one of them.
even during his impeachment, clinton's white house was viewed as much more trustworthy than trump's ever was. bush's white house held a lot of trust and confidence from americans that evaporated following then-secretary of state colin powell's presentation to the united nations about the risk posed by iraq — an incorrect argument, as it turned out — and the war in that country that followed.
and the move would particularly help those likely to have lost income during the pandemic who are buying marketplace coverage because they don't have it through their workplaces.
the tension is over whether teachers should be required to return to classrooms before getting the coronavirus vaccine. some teachers unions – who were a major contributor to biden's campaign – are insisting they shouldn't have to return to in-person learning until all teachers have been vaccinated. yet upon becoming president, biden made reopening schools a major goal – one that he has since appeared to back away from.
bertolini spoke at length about the need to transform the health-care system and care for people before they are acutely sick. smarter interventions could lead to better outcomes and lower costs, he argued. and he said high drug prices aren't always a problem. he pointed to the new generation of hepatitis c therapies, which can cure the disease but are expensive — and argued that curing hepatitis c is better than waiting to pay for a liver transplant.
question: fifteen to 20 percent? sorry (ph).
yes, ma'am? question: (inaudible) news, what kind of relationship is trump looking for to build with china after he withdraw from tpp? and on taiwan's issue, what kinds of stand he is going to make on (inaudible)
it is not likely that any of those ideas will go anywhere, but doing this would demonstrate to voters that the law can be made to work better for them.
the inmates here are at least alive — unlike so many drug users in this part of central ohio, 40 miles southwest of columbus. fayette county has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to internal data from the centers for disease control and prevention obtained and analyzed by the washington post.
mr. obama tried to be the president for everyone in the country, while mr. trump is concerned only with his base. mr. obama was attacked from day one by republicans, who refused to work with him in any legislative capacity and routinely stymied his efforts to repair the economy.
trump also signed a bipartisan legislative package weeks before the 2018 midterm election that creates, expands and renews programs designed to fight the epidemic.
the desire to reflect the will of voters also helps explain why caucus members defend the white house. during the gop primaries, trump dominated his rivals in freedom caucus districts, including candidates backed by many caucus members. caucus members also feel pressure from their constituents to support the president's policy goals.
spicer: yes, i think 41 million people watched his. 41 million watched his. ok? so, let's just take the nielsen ratings, which are 31 million and add it to cnn, 16.9 million. that's a little higher. so, i'm just saying, i'm not -- you're asking me for numbers, there's just two entities together.
in the meanwhile, people are dying, and that's haunted me, said madras, a harvard medical school professor who served in the drug czar's office during the george w. bush administration.
question: a couple things if i could. later this week, in his executive actions, does the president plan to take action to green light the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines? and on tpp, joe mccain says it was a serious mistake to do what the president did for america's economy and for our strategic position in the asia- pacific. why was tpp the right thing to do?
-- future campaign ad material: nancy pelosi held a vote to force house republicans to go on the record about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of obamacare. mike debonis reports: the house gave itself the power to intervene legally after a federal judge ruled that the affordable care act was unconstitutional. wednesday's vote was largely symbolic — democrats voted last week to authorize legal action as part of a broader rules package — but it was the first time that lawmakers were presented with a discrete measure dealing with what was a dominant issue in the nov. 6 midterm elections. … the measure passed 235 to 192, with all democrats supporting it and all but three republicans opposing it.
spicer: i'm not going to - no decision has been made at this time on that.
ahh: the trump administration is expected to issue guidance on allowing states to convert medicaid funding into block grants as soon as this month. the move would follow the office of management and budget's signal in november that the initiative had been dropped or delayed, the wall street journal's stephanie armour reports.
these memorial services aren't just about looking back on mccain's life through a certain frame; mccain used his impending death to try to steer a country he thought was going in the wrong direction back to his vision of a hawkish america championing democracy abroad.

he rejected a deal that his own aides and gop leaders had negotiated after conservative media personalities got to him — and ann coulter threatened not to vote for him again in 2020. he's bending over backward to show his base that he's going to the mat for a wall. that's why trump is sitting down with fox news host sean hannity later today when he goes to the border in mcallen, tex.
if a president does overstep his authority, congress could cut off his funding or impeach him, but a president trump could counter with the power of the bully pulpit.
but again, i think that when you look net-net, we're going (ph) to do our best every time we can. i'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as i know them. and if we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it. but i don't -- i think that as i mentioned the other day, it is a two-way street. there are many mistakes that the media makes all the time. they misreport something, they don't report something, they get a fact wrong. i don't think that's always -- you know, to turn around and say, okay, you were intentionally lying. i think we all try to do our best job, and do it with a degree of integrity in our respective industries.

masterpiece's concurrences suggest that justices thomas, alito and gorsuch would like to apply a broader idea of religious liberty. the chief justice did not join those opinions. the opinions written or joined by justices ginsburg, breyer, sotomayor and kagan resisted broad claims that religious liberty could override anti-discrimination laws.
and they called on the administration to further promote the law during the pandemic, by opening up healthcare.gov for a special enrollment period.
spicer: well, i think he's gonna work with congress to get the appropriations process going. but it's not -- it's not just building the wall. that's through the appropriations process. it's how do we enact policies to make sure that what we have now doesn't happen again. and so it's -- it is -- it is working with them.
spicer: i -- i think that we'll have to -- we don't have anything in front of us right now to sign on. so give us a little bit of time, we'll see what congress moves forward with, and then i'm sure we'll have a further read out on both, the executive order piece and on the legislation.
health officials worry that people may become picky about which vaccine they get.
republicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. that means the narrow democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. and with the slimmest possible majority, democrats will have to stick together. a single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.
so, we'll get there. we -- we got a lot of calls to return. there's a lot of excitement through the world. and a lot of people who are really excited, both to come here, and have the president visit them.
the challenges we face as a nation are great. but our people are even greater.
solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. it will require us to tap into the american spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
spicer: i'd have to get back to you on the number but it's actually fairly robust right now. there are a lot of hold over's, but general flynn has been working diligently with k.t. mcfarland -- his deputy and others to make sure that that's filled out and ready to go. he's had countless meetings with counterparts and had several folks detailed over. but it's a very very robust efforts from day one.
she said different women were there for different reasons but they were all there to make sure that their core american values are going to be protected and i think many people like me were there for positive reasons. and i think the president shares debbie dingell's views that there were people that came to the mall as they do all the time, sometimes in smaller numbers...
iowa farm bureau spokeswoman laurie johns said that about 15,000 members contacted their state legislators to support the bill. the new plans could be on sale through bureau agents in every county as early as the fall, for current members or anyone who pays a $55 annual fee to join, she said.
mccain ostensibly had plenty of time to orchestrate his memorial services as he battled brain cancer for a year before his death saturday. that he would choose not to have his own vice presidential pick at his memorial service can be interpreted as a neon flashing signal to the world not just about his own personal regrets in life but how concerned he was about the rise of trumpism — and perhaps his role in it.
experts say that the new guidance reflects a growing concern about how to reach people who may face barriers to access, including those with disabilities or people who may struggle to sign up for vaccine appointments online.

but barr is refusing to meet with several democrats on the committee he will appear before next week, with the administration citing the shutdown as the reason. a daily beast reporter wondered:
oof: trump said he may soon loosen coronavirus containment guidelines for social distancing, despite dire warnings from public health experts, our post colleagues philip rucker, jeff stein, josh dawsey and ashley parker report.
-- gizmodo, how cartographers for the u.s. military inadvertently created a house of horrors in south africa, by kashmir hill: the visitors started coming in 2013. the first one who came and refused to leave until he was let inside was a private investigator named roderick. he was looking for an abducted girl, and he was convinced she was in the house. john s. and his mother ann live in the house, which is in pretoria, the administrative capital of south africa and next to johannesburg. … john and ann are not criminals. john is a lawyer who works on property law and human rights cases—helping asylum seekers and returning stolen land to black south africans. ann is a nurse who has spent most of her life in labor and delivery rooms in africa and the middle east. … they just happen to live in a very unfortunate location, a location cursed by dimwitted decisions made by people who lived half a world away, people who made designations on maps and in databases without thinking about the real-world places and people they represented.
this was the argument made by supporters of sanders in 2016: that while his positions were more liberal than the norm (and than clinton), he could have beaten trump simply by virtue of not being clinton running against a very unpopular republican. the energy he engendered from democratic primary voters might, they argue, have been key to goosing turnout enough for a victory.
i was in vegas the other day and someone said 'don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.' that's the problem, klobuchar said, noting that majorities of house and senate democrats and numerous democratic governors don't support the approach.
you've got the worst drug crisis we've had ever, and it takes you two years to get somebody in the white house who wakes up every day thinking about the problems? said keith humphreys, who served as a drug policy adviser to the george w. bush and obama administrations. that to me is just an astounding dereliction of duty.
and then the republicans and conservatives in congress will look up and say, wait a minute, how do i feel about this dividend? a lot of people in my district seem very excited about it. the one state that's had a dividend for almost 40 years, alaska, is a deep-red conservative state and it was passed by a republican governor. this is a big win for rural areas that are struggling and red states on the interior that have gotten blasted by automation. and so we just need some of these republican congressmen to say, i am for the dividend because i'm for economic freedom. and if you get a majority, then you can pass it. now, can you get all of them? almost certainly not. but this is a law like any other. so you don't need a supermajority. you just need a congressional majority to pass the bill.
for those reasons, his allies see few benefits to opposing the senate repeal bill even if it's less than ideal. voting no would be complicated to convey to the conservative base he needs to turn for him, some say.
or, as the republicans would call it, freedom! and if you lived in a red state, you would probably get more of it. that's because the senate bill would let them opt out of essential health benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs — and in the process, the brookings institution's matthew fiedler points out, bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. the result would be a system where healthy people would mostly buy cheaper plans that didn't cover much, and mostly sick people would buy ones that did, you know, cover things — which would only make those more comprehensive plans so expensive that hardly anybody would be able to buy them at all. people would be forced to buy skimpy insurance that might not even insure you if you use too much of it.

the united states has not studied the issue nationally, but workplace transmission has made for a significant portion of the infections across the country. hundreds of thousands of essential workers in industries such as health care, groceries, warehouses and meatpacking have been infected with the virus, and tens of thousands have died, eli writes.
the new attitude is a concern for some democrats. members of both parties have recently moved to dreaming big dreams without figuring out how to pay for it, said sen. thomas r. carper (d-del.). i came [to congress] with the idea that we'd be fiscally responsible, and neither party seems to be. my hope is we'll get back to that sooner rather than later.
after 9/11, the rush to expand the president's ability to respond quickly to attacks and to ferret out terrorists shifted the balance of power ever more decisively toward the white house. then-vice president dick cheney, a proponent of a stronger presidency going back to his days in congress three decades earlier, argued that the fragility of a world with nuclear weapons mandated an expansive presidency: the fact that the president is accompanied at all times by a military aide carrying the nuclear codes, he said, means that he doesn't have to check with anybody. he doesn't have to call the congress. he doesn't have to check with the courts. he has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in.
in speaking from a faith-based perspective, buttigieg, warren and others make a powerful point: what's wrong with trumpism — aside from its deceit, its authoritarianism, its rejection of the american creed and its economic illiteracy — is its rank cruelty. trump's actions routinely violate norms of decent behavior, which for many americans are grounded in a faith tradition.
consider the contrasts. mississippi has a poverty rate triple that of new hampshire. income inequality, measured as the ratio of the top 1 percent of earners to the other 99 percent, is more than three times higher in new york, connecticut and wyoming than in iowa, alaska and hawaii. mississippi's infant mortality rate is twice that of massachusetts, and its life expectancy is nearly seven years lower than hawaii's. the united states is now a nation where the government that citizens get depends increasingly on where they live, kettl laments.
under state law, republican gov. doug ducey would appoint a successor to mccain if the seat is vacant, sean and michael write. ducey is not speculating publicly about who he might appoint, even as republicans in the state have mentioned his chief of staff and the state treasurer as possibilities ... friends who have visited mccain as he struggles with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer are encouraged by his recent state, though they recognize the 81-year-old's condition could deteriorate rapidly.

his trade tariffs and deals certainly challenged the lousy deals of the past, but the result to date contributed to what the federal reserve calls a technical recession in the manufacturing sector and increasing economic strain on small farmers. no wonder bankruptcies and suicides are rising among small farmers. and while the white house trumpeted aid to farmers, the environmental working group reports that the top 10 percent of farms — the largest and most profitable, industrial scale farms in the country — received 50 percent of the money. the bottom 80 percent received an average of $5,136.

campaigning in a virtual mode forces a team to translate the modern elements of a campaign into new forms. the biden team is going to have to learn as it goes, substituting virtual news conferences, virtual fundraisers, virtual roundtables and virtual volunteer events for physical, in-person affairs.
-- a coast guard program offered service employees recommendations for how to get through the shutdown, such as holding a garage sale or babysitting. dan lamothe reports: the suggestions were part of a five-page tip sheet published by the coast guard support program ... it is designated to offer coast guard members help with mental-health issues or other concerns about their lives, including financial wellness. 'bankruptcy is a last option,' the document said. … the coast guard removed the tip sheet from the support program's website late wednesday morning after the washington post inquired about it.
there's another potential hiccup. it's not entirely clear whether all the elements of medicare-x could go into a budget reconciliation bill, which can only include provisions directly related to federal spending.

on jan. 2, 2019, the senate confirmed james w. carroll jr. to be trump's first permanent drug czar. a former washington-based counsel to the ford motor co., carroll had served as trump's deputy chief of staff. it had been two years since trump took office.
and it was interesting, i know when we talked about carrier at one point, someone said well, that's a thousand jobs. when you talk about those thousand jobs and their families, during the holiday season i would beg to differ that those people were unbelievably ecstatic that the president and the vice president intervened.
polls show trump's approval ratings are recovering from the impeachment inquiry. trump's republican support is solid even as other americans are repulsed by his crimes and outrages — from using public office for personal gain, to locking up kids in cages on the border, to cynically exacerbating america's racial tensions, to the denial of the greatest threat to our security: catastrophic climate change.
abc's jonathan karl raised that point with vice president pence in an interview that aired tuesday morning.
the host of morning joe, a former republican congressman, reflected on the future of the gop:
mulvaney, defending president trump's revived push to replace the affordable care act, made several inaccurate statements about health care when he made the rounds of the sunday-morning talk shows. but we are going to focus on this one because it involves numbers and allows for a relatively straightforward fact check.
she was particularly drawn to the issue after seeing devastated families on the 2016 presidential campaign trail and the toll the epidemic had taken in places like ohio, pennsylvania and new hampshire. she also had attended the public hearings held by christie's commission.
on march 19, 2018, trump and sessions traveled to manchester, n.h., to highlight the fight against opioids. the president told the crowd gathered at manchester community college that congress was working on legislation that would set aside billions to fight the epidemic. he said he planned to increase funding to develop nonaddictive painkillers. he also said he was working to shut down illegal online marketplaces to block fentanyl coming in from china.
some trump initiatives, such as repealing obamacare, cutting taxes or expanding social security, would require extensive, close work with congress. but presidents already have the power to do much of what trump has proposed. congress has given the president the authority to make trade deals, for example, and trump could try to renegotiate the nuclear deal with iran.

i don't think he has obviously attacked him in a while, but when the news came out that he was apparently, allegedly making physical mockeries of my father's war injuries … i was deeply hurt by it, she added. mccain was referring to a story in axios from september that reported trump had physically mocked mccain imitating the thumbs-down of his historic health-care vote.
trevor noah mocked the democratic response to trump's address:
if the ruling were to be put into effect immediately, it would rescind coverage for millions of americans as well as undo consumer protections and regulations that have reshaped the business models for insurers, drug companies, hospitals and doctors, all during a pandemic that's prompted 485,000 americans to sign up for obamacare after losing health-care coverage from their employer. the court, as part of any ruling against obamacare, could also issue a stay to give the biden administration a chance to respond. or congress, now in democratic hands by the slimmest margin, could try to forestall the ruling by restoring a nominal tax for the mandate, or passing a law specifying that the loss of the mandate should not bring down the rest of the law.

● environment. the administration revoked one of the most significant obama-era environmental rules, over waters of the united states. the earlier regulation had expanded federal protection and regulation of such waters to include streams, ponds and even drainage ditches that feed into larger waterways. environmental groups argue that the change will result in massive loss of wetlands critical for combating climate change and threaten the drinking water supply.

with all due respect to gary abernathy, he is just plain wrong in his claim regarding donald trump's presidency. true, mr. trump won the electoral college vote, but he did not get the majority of votes. indeed, as mr. abernathy noted, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton got almost 66 million votes; mr. trump, ­63 million.
i didn't find him helpful at all on the issue, christie said. he only had one tune, which was enforcement. he didn't want to talk about the other parts of the issue. i wanted him to engage on treatment, on drug courts, and he had no interest in engaging in that. so, after a while, i just stopped calling because, what was the use?

sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) and rep. frank pallone jr. (d-n.j.) sent a letter to the department of health and human service's office of inspector general, saying the tennessee proposal would create an incentive for the state to reduce benefits. they asked the watchdog to monitor the center for medicare & medicaid services' approach to the waiver to ensure that medicaid funds are used for their statutory purpose of furnishing medical assistance to low-income individuals.
if the aca's insurance rules can't be repealed, then an alternative is to get people the option of escaping them, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. without the penalty, the door is wide open for plans like this.
everyone here today is united by the same vital goal — to liberate our fellow americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all, trump said at a drug abuse summit in atlanta on april 24. it's happening. it's happening.
washington post fact-checker glenn kessler waded into the dispute. he notes that vaccinations under the trump administration reached a seven-day average of 980,000, virtually the goal of a million shots a day that biden had set for himself. but biden administration officials say that the plan set up by the trump administration did not have a solid national strategy for vaccinating people once the first stage of inoculating health-care workers and long-term care residents was complete.
● health care. the administration proposed letting states limit the amounts they spend on medicaid for poor adults. it invited states to transform that part of medicaid funding into a block grant and offered them new flexibility to cut coverage and benefits. block grants are a favored republican technique to limit entitlement spending, and the administration's proposal was a way to achieve, in a more limited way, what it was unable to get through even a republican congress, which balked at its effort to block-grant medicaid three years ago.
so how are these remorseful senators defending what some now say was the wrong move, to stand by trump for so long?
oof: robin williams's suicide in august 2014 appears to be linked with a nearly 10 percent spike in the number of suicides in the united states in the following five months. our colleague amy ellis nutt reports on a study finding the increase was especially marked among men ages 30 to 44, whose suicide rate rose nearly 13 percent. even more notably, there was a more than 32 percent spike in the number of suicides by suffocation, which is how williams died.
and then to hear, well, look at this shot, and it's not -- it wasn't that big. it's a little demoralizing because when you're sitting there and you're looking out and you're in awe of just how awesome that view is and how many people are there and you go back and you turn on the television and you see shots of comparing this and that. and then you look at the stuff that's happening.
in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, trump promised to halt the flow of heroin into the united states. he mentioned that drug, not fentanyl, at least 57 times during his speeches and appearances, and he tied the crisis to the need to build a wall along the border with mexico. on the campaign trail, trump was moved by the people he met who had lost family members to the epidemic, conway said. as he left one stop, someone called out: please follow through on the drugs and opioids. you promised.
at a metro stop in west baltimore recently, down the block from an open-air drug market, members of the nonprofit bmore power handed out free doses of narcan. steve diggs, 47, said he had peddled drugs on the streets of the city for nearly 30 years. now in recovery and working for the group, he and other former drug dealers and users are trying to prevent more deaths, which he said started to soar with the arrival of fentanyl in 2015.

there are several categories of medical benefits covered only minimally by medicare or not at all, including long-term care, mental-health services and most dental care. enrollees in medicaid, by contrast, can access a pretty comprehensive array of inpatient and outpatient services. medicaid plans cover not only all 10 of the health benefits considered essential under the affordable care act but also nursing home care and long-term care services.

-- trump officials have compiled a list of some 50 infrastructure projects across the country to place on an infrastructure priority list, as the white house tries to determine investment priorities for their nascent administration. the projects reportedly total at least $137.5 billion, and could include items such as a new terminal for the kansas city airport, upgrades to interstate 95 in north carolina and the construction of a high-speed railway from dallas to houston.

iowa lawmakers approved the farm bureau plan last month as federal agencies are taking steps to carry out a directive by president trump to make it easier for americans to buy coverage that skirts those requirements.
question: is the president going to shake up the leadership of cfpb before the director's term's up?
you have to put the quality people in charge with accountability to the president. the president of the united states is not concerned about the v.a. that is not what he's worried about. he talks a great deal about his support of veterans, but doesn't do much other than when the cameras are on.
trump's pronouncements on a range of health-care topics — such as preexisting condition protections, the effects of medicare-for-all and the state of the affordable care act — are among the more than 16,200 false or misleading claims he has made in his three years since taking the oath of office.
officials warn about a grim week ahead:
second, biden now can put meat on the bones of his message that the election is a fight for the soul of the nation. originally, this meant a battle to recapture america as a decent, fair and welcoming country. now, in the covid-19 pandemic, the battle is between two ways of addressing adversity. in biden's telling, republicans focus on bailing out corporate interests (e.g., the giant slush fund) and savaging regulations (even clear-air requirements in the middle of a respiratory illness) while democrats want to focus on more help for nurses and responders, more unemployment pay and more help for small business. (the senate majority leader is already dragging his feet on a fourth stimulus package). how the two sides react to the pandemic becomes emblematic of their values and priorities.
for iowa, the farm bureau plan is the state's second attempt to bypass parts of the aca. last year, the state's insurance commissioner asked federal health officials to allow iowa to take about $350 million in aca money for 2018 and use it in different ways to help people pay for plans outside the marketplace. state officials said at first that the trump administration seemed receptive. but when the government had not given approval as last fall's aca enrollment season neared, iowa withdrew the proposal.
left unsaid in this defense, of course, is that trump also helped remake the republican party in ways party leaders couldn't imagine, in ways that seemed fantastic at first. he was the first republican in 30 years to win wisconsin in the 2016 elections. he flipped michigan and the all-important pennsylvania. he helped boost turnout in 2020 down the ballot that stopped a blue wave in its tracks.

it is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. those given the high honor of admission to the united states should support this country and love its people and its values.
totenberg, an atlanta judge appointed by president barack obama, wrote that the government and the nonprofit agency that runs the u.s. transplant system had provided the plaintiffs due process and an opportunity to have their views heard, even if the new policy did not work in their favor, lenny writes. those patients and hospitals, in places such as georgia, kentucky, kansas and virginia, have said they would face the prospect of fewer available organs under the new rules, as more livers are taken by transplant centers in cities with greater demand and higher insurance payments.
regardless, now that he's in the oval office and will soon get to appoint one of his own people to run the irs, trump's team is changing course.
another constant heckler was alyssa mitchell, 21, a college student from richmond, which is not in brat's district. at one point she yelled: how about trump! why doesn't he pay his taxes?
-- 52 is the new 47: labor secretary nominee andrew puzder said in a 2011 speech that the electoral balance in the u.s. was tilted against republicans because a large segment of the population would always vote benefits to themselves. the quote, unearthed by cnn's andrew kaczynski and chris massie: last year, 52% of the people in the country got more from government than they gave to government, puzder said. we do have a segment of the population that's going to continue to vote benefits to themselves. you have to make a decision for yourself which party actually supports that and would therefore want to continue to have those people vote for them by taking from the rich and giving to the poor, as they like to say, which tilts the electoral balance in favor of those who get the benefits. if they are more than 50% of the population, we've got a problem. he continued, in california, i think the last election showed that. i think we have higher than 52% of the people … i think 49% of the people in california don't even pay taxes.
question: were those conversations about anything else other than setting up that discussion? and why has that discussion not yet happened between the president and president putin?
lahrs mehlum, the director of norway's centre for suicide prevention, said the media's portrayal of williams's death may have played a role. sadly, there were all too many examples of unfortunate presentations of the case of robin williams' suicide, mehlum said. many journalists failed to mention the huge health problems williams struggled with (both mentally and physically), but rather portrayed a glorified version of the event. this is not according to international guidelines for media reporting of suicide.
fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance — and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.
spicer: well, i think his relationship with the hispanic community is going to be great. i think he's -- as i said, i think that whether it's jobs or education or healthcare, the president is committed to uniting all americans and working towards a better, safer, more secure, more prosperous america that benefits everybody. and i think whether -- regardless of your background, that's something he is committed to.
brad smith — who led medicare's innovation center and served as a top white house health policy official — has launched russell street ventures, the tennessean reported on tuesday. the firm is focused on creating or incubating health care companies that focus on serving vulnerable patients; the leadership team includes rachel baitel, a trump white house veteran, and eric hargarten and kara pitts, who did stints at cms working with smith.
this is a small step but an important step in the right direction, said grant smith, deputy director of national affairs for the drug policy alliance. if, in fact, it's going towards boosting our treatment capacity, that is certainly a welcome development.
oof: nebraska state troopers seized 118 pounds of fentanyl — containing enough lethal doses to kill tens of millions of people — in a record-breaking drug bust last month, the post's lindsey bever reports. nebraska state patrol col. john bolduc announced thursday the massive amount of suspected opioids tested positive for fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin. nebraska officials said it marked the largest fentanyl seizure in state history and one of the largest in the united states.
as conway took control of the opioid issue, confusion spread within the drug czar's office and across the government, according to former staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the administration. staffers in the office said they would frequently field calls from other agencies and congressional offices, requesting direction on how to increase funding for treatment or how to launch anti-opioid public education campaigns. they said they had no authority to make decisions on their own, and the queries languished.
-- maryland senate president mike miller is receiving treatment for prostate cancer. ovetta wiggins and rachel chason report: miller, 76, the longest-serving senate president in the country, received the diagnosis shortly after the christmas holiday, [two sources said] … one person with direct knowlege of miller's condition described it as 'aggressive,' and said the senate president was emotional when he recently talked about the diagnosis and reminisced about his long tenure in the senate. the other person described the cancer as 'advanced.' miller had shared the news with only a few people as of wednesday, but he walked with a cane and appeared physically ill as he opened the annual 90-day legislative session in annapolis. a day earlier, he was absent from the democrats' annual pre-session luncheon.
keep in mind these numbers reflect where he is when the economy is strong, when the special counsel report has not been released, when congressional and southern district of new york prosecutors are still combing through his finances, and when hope exists of a face-saving deal with china that would avoid escalation of the trade war. if all or some of those turn out badly, things could really get ugly.
here are the principles that should guide the congress as we move to create a better health-care system for all americans:
acp recommends transitioning to a system that achieves universal coverage with essential benefits and lower administrative costs through two potential approaches: a single payer financing system or a publicly-financed coverage option with regulated private insurance, the group writes in a policy framework.
what we are witnessing today is the renewal of the american spirit.
it's an idea moderate democrats are wary of, for a host of reasons.
question: any other conversations between general flynn and russian members of the government?
in late january, sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) fell ill and was briefly hospitalized. a day later, sen. mark warner (d-va.) went into quarantine for a few days after coming in close contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.
that scenario could lead to a constitutional crisis, rudalevige said, especially if we still have an eight-member supreme court, assuming that the late justice antonin scalia's seat remained unfilled.
i am not -- i'm not aware of that conversation. i'm sure you've heard the president the last few weeks talk about the price of pharmaceutical drugs, and the need to get those prices down and bring manufacturing back in the pharmaceutical industry to benefit the country.
i think that's what he's going to talk about is supporting all of life, the born, the unborn, throughout life making sure that we have healthcare that can support the american people and the american families. that's -- that's what he's gonna fight for and that's what he's gonna be clear on.
nations around the world, like canada, australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. it is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. yet, in america, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. according to the national academy of sciences, our current immigration system costs america's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.
becerra is expected to win approval in the committee, which will clear the way for his consideration by the full senate, reuters reports. the committee will also vote on biden's nomination of katherine tai as trade czar and wally adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary.
that doesn't mean her numbers will keep improving or that she won't still serve as a convenient lightning rod for republicans, and potentially help trump keep his base engaged for his reelection campaign. but this is a bit of a zero-sum game, and trump is dealing with something he has never dealt with before: a democrat with actual power who can stop him and reinforce his own weaknesses and miscues.
the court ruled friday the law could not be implemented before thursday, our post colleague robert barnes reports.
he campaigned on a pledge to expand the program by offering a government-provided alternative to private insurance that's known as a public option, a proposal he's called bidencare. it would be available to all americans, including those who get their insurance through work. low-income americans would be automatically enrolled and, if eligible, their premiums would be free. biden's plan also envisions expanding obamacare tax credits to try making premiums more affordable for middle-income households. his plan set him apart from the progressive wing of the democratic party, which has pushed the idea of achieving universal coverage by scrapping private insurance and replacing it with medicare for all.

-- lindsey graham is one of the very few republican senators with the courage to speak forthrightly on this in public: i would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on earth, we're the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification, lindsey told cnn.
so if we follow this through, i surprise in iowa, perform extraordinarily well in new hampshire, i become president of the united states in 2021, everyone would know that i won on the freedom dividend because that's my signature proposal. americans decided that $1,000 a month in cash is pretty great. and so then as president, i'm there celebrating with democrats and progressives because they're just thrilled we've beaten donald trump. they realized it was a bit of a bet, but it worked. and here we are.
the legislation, which the duo first introduced back in october 2017, now includes an expansion of marketplace tax subsidies to ensure people don't pay more than 8.5 percent of their income on monthly premiums. it would also eliminate a subsidy cap for people earning 400 percent of the federal poverty level or more.
a flashback to just last month:
but the group doesn't plan to endorse any 2020 candidate's plan.
question: ... on a statement that the president made on saturday. can you -- and i just want to clarify your answer here.
but to sum up, the rhetoric of sweeping, day-one change is almost always belied by the reality of presidential life. it will be interesting to see whether trump meant his promises to reverse obama policies literally — and will issue that flurry of executive orders — or whether he meant it seriously, and will reach his goals through other means. or perhaps changing the direction of the ship of state will be more difficult than he anticipated.
several scientists are now trying to organize another march on washington, akin to last weekend's women's march, to raise awareness about what they see as trump's hostility to science. (sarah kaplan is tracking it.)
there are so many chinese businesses and individuals frankly, who can have ease of access in the united states to sell their goods or services. i think that whether or not you're talking about the financial services or the banking, you know, the other service industries, or our manufacturing goods and services, or some of the ip problems that we have with china, that it really is not a two way street. and so he understands the market that china has and our desire to further penetrate that market. but he also recognizes, there's a lot of concerns with how we are treated entering into china's market, and we need to review that.
oof: biden and fauci are butting heads over teacher vaccinations.
in his address yesterday, he criticized the president's response. trump keeps saying that he's a wartime president. well, start to act like one. … donald trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response, he said. i, along with every american, hope he steps up and starts to get this right.
we're not going to sacrifice our values for the sake of compromise. you think people from red states are going to be for tax reform with 98 percent of tax breaks going to the top 1 percent?

spicer: what's the last part, please?
-- trump has said it's better to be feared than loved, but democratic leaders simply aren't scared of him. pelosi called him petulant after the meeting and then took a dig at trump's false narrative that he's a self-made man. noting that federal workers are about to miss a paycheck, the house speaker said: he thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money. but they can't.
finally, i have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the united states supreme court — from my list of 20 judges — who will defend our constitution. i am honored to have maureen scalia with us in the gallery tonight. her late, great husband, antonin scalia, will forever be a symbol of american justice. to fill his seat, we have chosen judge neil gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. he was confirmed unanimously to the court of appeals, and i am asking the senate to swiftly approve his nomination.
and i think that's why he wanted to do it is to make sure that they understand they heard first hand how much he respects them. how much he wanted to dispel the myth that there was a rift.
question: ...during the campaign, he at one point, trump at one point said it was 42 percent. i just wanna...
a spokesman for sen. joe manchin told me that while the west virginia democrat is pleased with the new funding stream, he's concerned with making sure his state gets a fair share of the dollars give it has the highest rates of drug abuse in the nation. manchin, up for reelection this year in a state won by trump, is also well-placed to weigh in, as he sits on the senate appropriations committee.

though a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. among biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for medicare and expanding obamacare. reconciliation could also empower democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by republicans as well as portions of biden's climate and immigration priorities. the congressional review act also will enable democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the trump administration with simple majorities. democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.
what will be included in the legislation? it's set to include direct payments of $1,200 to many americans adults and $500 to children; roughly $850 billion in loan and assistance programs for businesses, states and cities; and spending increases for the unemployment insurance program, as well as hospitals and health-care providers reeling from the crisis.
sen. ted cruz (r-tex.), ahead or tied for the lead in most recent iowa polls, is making a six-day primary-season pilgrimage across iowa this week, looping around the state on a journey that began monday in the center of the state, in the town of boone. here's the view from the press bus on day one.
question: where's the president's thinking now on the supreme court? (inaudible) naming some nominees? and in a follow-up to...
but the senator's colleagues need him as much as he needs them, so it's a role many are embracing — at least for the moment.
approving state waivers to change medicaid funding to block grants would be among the administration's most controversial moves to reshape medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health coverage to one in five low-income americans. medicaid is the main source of long-term care coverage for americans and is a guaranteed benefit, or entitlement, for eligible individuals, she writes.
-- republican senators promised william barr would not interfere with mueller's investigation if he is confirmed as attorney general. karoun demirjian, seung min kim and devlin barrett report: 'based on what i heard, he has a high opinion of mr. mueller, believes mr. mueller is doing a professional job, will do a professional job and be fair to the president and the country as a whole,' senate judiciary committee chairman lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) told reporters, adding that barr sees 'no reason for mr. mueller to stop doing his job and is committed to allowing mr. mueller to finish.' graham is one of four republican senators with whom barr met on wednesday, as he prepares for a two-part confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee next tuesday and wednesday. sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), one of the senators who met with barr on wednesday afternoon, emerged citing similar confidence that the nominee would be largely hands-off when it came to mueller's probe.
spicer: ok. i have that's (ph) very polite of you.
at three o'clock, union leaders and front line workers will meet with the president to discuss his pro-worker agenda. attendees include tom flynn of the united brotherhood of carpenters; sean mcgarvey, president of the north american building and construction trades department; terry o'sullivan, general president of the laborers; international union of america -- of north america; mark mcmanus, the general president of united association; donald mullins (ph), steamfitters united association local 602; frank spencer, united brotherhood of carpenters; doug mccarron, general president, united brotherhood of carpenters; mark coles of ironworkers local 5; joseph sellers junior, the general president of the sheet metal workers union/smart union; thelma m. matta (ph), the heat and frost insulators and allied workers (ph) local 24; mark urkowski (ph), united association local 5; steven dodd, the sheet metal workers union/smart union, gary macino (ph) the sheet metal worker's union smart union. the president has been honored to received tremendous support from union working men and women on election day and he's dedicated to growing and deepening their support. and he made it a priority to meet with these union workers on our working day one, here in the white house. the off shoring or american jobs and lack of economic growth in recent years, has hit american workers particularly hard. and the president's top priority is to retain and attract american jobs, which have already seen happening through his actions on carrier, sprint, general motors and so many more.
the freedom caucus is not driven solely by a desire for more power. policy goals also matter. one caucus member told me that hardball tactics were necessary because we have some serious [policy] issues that face us, while another observed that the group's meetings were often productive because no one's questioning anyone's conservative credentials.
from former senator and presidential candidate santorum:

senate majority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) says the senate will move on the package as soon as today.
the scheme promoted by the administration and embodied in the tennessee waiver proposal would threaten beneficiary access to care in many ways, including all but ensuring medicaid dollars are diverted by purposes not allowed under federal law, pallone and wyden wrote. we strongly encourage you to exercise vigorous oversight of this and other medicaid waiver requests that if approved would provide states vast sums of federal dollars with no accountability.
my economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. at the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
but the war powers resolution, the intelligence oversight act, the congressional budget act and the independent counsel act — all designed to limit presidential unilateralism — have proved toothless, and congress has since ceded even more authority.
the screening is the first time such a system has been implemented for an infectious disease since the 2014 ebola epidemic.
trump would also repeal a fee on wealthy taxpayers' investments imposed as part of president obama's health-care legislation, also known as obamacare. most economists believe that reducing the rate on corporate income to 15 percent would mainly benefit those who own stock in those corporations, who tend to be richer.
other promises put him in disputed terrain, such as his vow to bomb isis, circle their territory and take the oil. some argue that such actions must be authorized by congress under the war powers resolution, which was passed over president nixon's veto in 1973. but presidents since then have routinely ordered military action without seeking a congressional green light.
but prominent historians expressed dismay when told about the action taken by the archives,
-- robert barnes reports on the short list: sources involved in the process say a handful of federal appeals court judges have emerged as top contenders, including william pryor of the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta, neil gorsuch of the 10th circuit in denver, thomas hardiman of the 3rd circuit in philadelphia and raymond kethledge of the 6th circuit in cincinnati. here's the scoop on some of his top picks:
quote of the day: democratic attacks on tom price over his ethics prompted sen. johnny isakson (r-ga.), who officially introduced price to his finance committee colleagues, to say, i feel like i've been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction. for his part, price said: everything that i did was ethical, aboveboard, legal and transparent. – tom price at his confirmation hearing
the success of trump's plan could depend on how successful his aides and republican staff on the hill are in avoiding a major loophole that could be created by his plan.
as we've noted before, democrats advocating for medicare-for-all face challenging questions about exactly how they'd fold more people into the program, how it would be paid for and what benefits would be covered. if the goal is more generous benefits, medicaid could be a more obvious model than medicare, experts say.
conway said their criticism was unfounded.
the virus is little more than a packet of genetic material surrounded by a spiky protein shell one-thousandth the width of an eyelash, and leads such a zombielike existence that it's barely considered a living organism, our post colleagues sarah kaplan, william wan and joel achenbach report.  … as researchers race to develop drugs and vaccines for the disease that has already sickened 350,000 and killed more than 15,000 people, and counting, this is a scientific portrait of what they are up against.

during the presidential transition, brooks-lasure served as a lead for biden's hhs review team, helping assess the trump administration's operations, dan and amy write. she has most recently served as a managing director at manatt health, a consulting firm that works with the health-care industry — a role that raised some concerns inside the biden administration given the president's stringent ethics pledge and the potential for brooks-lasure to shape policies that might affect her former clients, said one person familiar with those concerns.
right now, american companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
the house speaker reacted to trump's threat to withhold federal money to fight wildfires in california:
and he said categorically that while religious and philosophical objections are protected … such objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and service under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law. this sends a pretty strong signal that kennedy, at least, would resist broad religious-liberty claims that shielded merchants from anti-discrimination laws.
this is all bad enough. but here's the real rub: there's no reason to believe such an outcome would actually force democrats to cooperate on health reform on the gop's terms.

kaine and bennet want medicare-x to hitch a ride on a reconciliation bill. congress can only pass one of these bills a year and is using last year's vehicle to do coronavirus relief. two more budget reconciliation bills will be available during the current congress — and kaine and bennet say they've revamped medicare-x with an eye toward them.
kettl demonstrates that federalism has always been a dynamic experience, with fuzzy and shifting lines between federal and state powers. key supreme court decisions — mcculloch v. maryland (1819), plessy v. ferguson (1896), brown v. board of education (1954) — have shifted the relative powers forward, back and forward again. federal grants, an early-19th-century innovation that lured states to become agents of national policy through offers too good to refuse, had an enormous impact, allowing federal powers to build interstates, set public school standards and insure the poor.
no one was immediately nominated to become the drug czar. as the trump presidency entered its seventh month, there was no permanent official in charge of coordinating drug policy across myriad federal agencies — the cdc, the national institute on drug abuse, the justice department and the department of homeland security.
i think the judges he has nominated have been outstanding choices, sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) said thursday, when reporters asked him asked why he stuck by a president from whom he's now separating himself.  … i think what he did to destroy the caliphate was long overdue. it makes us safer. i think getting out of the iran nuclear agreement has led the way to peace between the arabs and the israelis at a level i would never have imagined. i think he's brought order to the border. he listened to me.

trump's proposal would open up a major discrepancy between the rate for individual taxpayers (35 percent in the new document) and the rate for corporations and businesses (the document calls for 15 percent). that gives individual taxpayers a good reason to claim that they are, in fact, businesses to avoid taxes.

i think there has been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset. and that's a move that we're trying to do to provide real relief and economic growth. when we start to grow the economy at 4, 4.1 percent, it actually not only increases wages, but it puts more money in americans' pockets each and every day.
spicer: i think we've always had that special relationship with britain. and -- and he's gonna -- and that reflects in -- in his first visits -- the prime minister's first visit here. he's had a great conversation with her and he looks forward to having her here. but we can always be closer.

brat held the meeting in a tiny town in nottoway county, a rural community carried by trump in november. it's about an hour south of where most in brat's district live, but that didn't stop a stream of people from driving into town and filling up the town hall, with hundreds shut out on the sidewalk.
lincoln was right — and it is time we heeded his words. i am not going to let america and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore.
i think you can't cave. that's what the democrats don't understand — it's all or nothing, said trump ally rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), a leader of the house freedom caucus. the democrats think that we're about ready to fold. i think republicans think that democrats are ready to fold, and neither of those two things are accurate by any stretch of the imagination.
spicer: right. well, i don't think -- i don't think he left them out. i think he was focused on this country, our -- our american workers. i don't think he got into detail on any countries that i am aware of or that i can recall.
the trump administration introduced a proposed rule wednesday that includes provisions aimed at addressing one of insurers' complaints about obamacare -- the special enrollment periods that allow people to sign up for health coverage outside of the open enrollment period. insurers have complained that people wait until they are sick to sign up for health coverage, and the proposed rule would require people to supply documentation that they are eligible to enroll.
spicer: i don't know. i'll -- i'll have to get back to you on that one right now. or -- i think the best thing to do, would probably contact the department of state.
roughly 20 million. about two-thirds of them joined medicaid as a result of the expanded eligibility. the rest found coverage by comparison-shopping among private insurers at government-run online marketplaces, where policies include subsidies for people who make as much as 400% of the federal poverty level. (the expanded version of medicaid enrolls people earning up to 138% of the poverty line.) even with obamacare in place, 28.9 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, two million more than in 2016, according to the kaiser family foundation. the u.s. is an outlier among developed countries by not having universal health coverage.
this is one of the most expensive ways to expand coverage, said cynthia cox, an affordable care act expert at the kaiser family foundation who has analyzed the proposal.
brooks-lasure served in the obama administration as a senior cms official who helped implement the affordable care act's coverage expansion and insurance-market reforms, dan and amy report. she also worked on capitol hill as a democratic staff member for the house ways and means committee, building ties with then-rep. xavier becerra, biden's choice to lead the health and human services department and who sat on the committee at the time.

such grants are central to kettl's solution, which draws inspiration from the writings of alexander hamilton, who championed a strong central government because he was skeptical that the states could ever give the country the direction it needed. kettl's advice is to transform the grants' role by focusing them primarily on inequality-busting initiatives to redistribute wealth from rich to poor, and social benefits to the very young and very old from the rest of us. as part of this effort, washington would take a stronger hand in how medicaid is administered by the states and in encouraging the states to adopt policy innovations successfully tested by their counterparts.
schumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative democrats such as joe manchin of west virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.

-- the federal hiring freeze trump put into place on monday could turn out to be a more symbolic, less forceful measure than it appears to be, lisa rein reports – and in fact, the memo regarding the 2.1 million civilians in the federal workforce leaves plenty of room for exceptions: federal offices in many corners of government could continue to hire, as long as the job has — or can be construed to have — a national security or public safety mission. individual cabinet secretaries and agency heads have broad leeway to decide on exemptions. and the hiring ban is scheduled to last 90 days, after which the [omb] is slated to come up with a long-term plan to shrink the federal workforce through attrition. a more permanent approach would still constitute a freeze of sorts but would resemble more of a selective slowdown, experts said. yet the language of the memorandum instituting the freeze is so vague that a day after trump signed it, agency officials were scrambling to determine whether and how the move will affect them.
according to ommen, the farm bureau modeled its idea after a similar arrangement sponsored by the tennessee farm bureau, which began decades ago and has continued in the aca era. the obama administration never challenged it.
but health policy experts say drug treatment funding is not nearly enough, and the administration's response was hobbled by the failure to appoint a drug czar in its chaotic first year and confusion over who was in charge of drug policy. the depth of the problem continues to overwhelm the government's response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by congress.
