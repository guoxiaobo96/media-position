announcing an 'lgbt-inclusive' update to all of its products, education giant pearson has launched a guide to pushing 'social justice' activism in every part of the school curriculum.\n\n'creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum' was produced by lgbt activist group stonewall and is sponsored by pearson, which owns the exam board edexcel and publishes thousands of school textbooks as one of the uk's biggest education companies.\n\nclaiming an inclusive curriculum is a crucial part of tackling homophobic bullying in schools, the handbook advises ways in which teachers can alter lessons across the syllabus so lgbt pupils see themselves represented in what they're learning.\n\nwriting about the need to stamp out anti-lgbt bullying in a foreword to the guide, the senior vice-president for schools at pearson uk, sharon hague, said: lgbt students will only feel comfortable to be themselves if they also get to see themselves in their classrooms.\n\norganised by subject, the guide lists suggestions to ensure lgbt visibility across the curriculum, for example recommending teachers set questions which reference homosexual relationships in maths and science, and introduce terminology specific to the lifestyles of sexual minorities in foreign language lessons.\n\nmaterial promoting gay and trans lifestyles could be spread across all parts of the curriculum in 120 uk schools. https://t.co/92rpsf1zbu — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) may 17, 2017\n\none example given is to begin a question with: two women would like to have a baby together, and the doctor recommends they use in vitro fertilisation (ivf).\n\nthe vast majority of suggestions go far beyond issues of visibility and representation, however, with most of the handbook's tips for creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum promoting hard-left 'social justice' activism and identity politics in the classroom.\n\nadvice on teaching maths includes an example lesson in which children learn about codebreaker alan turing. teachers are instructed to provide pupils with some information about alan turing's life, including the arrest and trial for his relationship with another man, and to introduce a discussion on the historical treatment of gay people by the secret services.\n\nin history lessons, pupils should study the links between different social justice movements, while art teachers are urged to explore the way that art has been, and is being, used to effect social and political change, including lgbt equality, race equality and tackling climate change.\n\nthe handbook calls for schools to push a left-wing agenda across every subject, recommending science teachers explore gender stereotypes and barriers to participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) subjects.\n\nthe dead white guys did not create this country, #commoncore https://t.co/tk4aix7oo5 — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) january 21, 2016\n\nsuggested activities include tasking pupils with devising a campaign to get more women involved in stem, and discussing questions such as why is it important that diverse groups of people, including lgbt people, enter stem professions?\n\npearson's president for core markets, rod bristow, said the company will use the handbook to help update our own products and resources to ensure they are lgbt inclusive.\n\nukip education spokesman david kurten stated that the despicable move is bad news for children and parents, who he pointed out will effectively have no choice but to be exposed to politicised education material due to pearson's position as the largest supplier of textbooks for schools, and the owner of britain's largest exam board, edexcel.\n\nmaths should be about maths, it should not be about sexualizing children, he told breitbart london, warning the new textbooks will make it significantly more difficult for parents to protect their children from the malign influence of left-wing identity politics.
israel's intelligence minister yisrael katz told an influential knesset committee on monday that iran was working to upgrade the military capabilities of the hamas terror group in the gaza strip.\n\nspeaking to the foreign affairs and defense committee on monday, katz said: in recent days, while we face the known threat from gaza, there is a direct iranian intervention. iran, hezbollah and hamas are involved in operative preparations to upgrade the threat to israel from the direction of gaza.\n\nthe islamic republic was increasing its involvement in the gaza strip after hamas was forced to leave qatar, following pressure from saudi arabia, katz told the committee, according to a report by the jerusalem post.\n\nthis meeting is under the shadow of a four-letter word: i-r-a-n, he minister told the committee.\n\nit's amazing how everything has to do with iran, katz continued. whether it's their nuclear aspirations and the need to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons… the attempt to improve its military preparedness in syria, training shi'ite militias [or] actions improving hezbollah missiles.\n\nin a short time we will see ourselves fighting a much more challenging threat on the operative and military levels if we don't change direction, the post quoted the minister as saying.\n\nreferring in brief to the ongoing protest in iran, katz said that israel would like to see the repressive regime removed and replaced with a democracy. we don't intervene, but we wish luck to the iranian people in pursuit of freedom and democracy.\n\nafter he made his comments, prime minister benjamin netanyahu instructed his government to avoid commenting on the protests in iran.\n\nit's not that they love zion, katz said in irony, discussing the iranian investment in money and manpower in several conflicts around the world. it's a question of whether resources should be used to support terror and aggression in syria, lebanon and gaza. all these developments require israel to consider them and try to change the situation.\n\nover the weekend, defense minister avigdor lieberman said that mortar shells fired at israel from gaza were made in iran.
purdue university professors have presented research on rapidly charging batteries that could change the face of the electric automotive industry.\n\nprofessor of earth, atmospheric and planetary science, and mathematics john cushman presented new research at the international society for porous media 9th international conference in rotterdam, netherlands. entitled redox reactions in immiscible-fluids in porous media – membraneless battery applications, the report outlines a new type of battery, and the method by which it could be recharged with unprecedented speed.\n\ncushman called the growing worldwide sales of electric and hybrid vehicles incredible, but said that there remained strong challenges for the industry and consumer alike. chief among those concerns is the life of a hybrid or electric vehicle's battery, and the massive infrastructure development needed to keep them charged. for drivers, it boils down to practicality. the time and effort required to keep their cars running is still an ongoing hurdle.\n\npurdue professor eric nauman is the co-founder, along with cushman, of ifbattery — a company exploring the commercial applications of their research. he highlighted the tremendous cost of developing infrastructure to handle the needed distribution and storage of the energy used by traditional electric vehicles. with cushman and nauman's new developments, they may have a solution: ifbattery is developing an energy storage system that would enable drivers to fill up their electric or hybrid vehicles with fluid electrolytes to re-energize spent battery fluids much like refueling their gas tanks.\n\nusing fluid electrolytes to power batteries gives them a much more accessible fuel supply. furthermore, the spent electrolytic fuel could be collected and recharged at a wind, solar, or hydroelectric power plant. cushman said:\n\ninstead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or re-charging into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. it is believed that our technology could be nearly 'drop-in' ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries.\n\nwith the potential for clean, efficient, and reusable fuel, both hybrid and electric vehicles could be poised for a leap into mass consumer relevance. backed up by higher capacity and recharging that is as easy as a stop at the gas station, we may be looking at the first truly pragmatic alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. all that remains to be seen is whether the cost of implementation is prohibitive. if not, purdue and ifbattery may very well force car companies and consumers alike to take notice.\n\nfollow nate church @get2church on twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.
as a member of the super bowl-bound philadelphia eagles, national anthem protester and social activist malcolm jenkins is allotted a group of tickets for the upcoming super bowl.\n\never the activist, jenkins decided to give his tickets to a convicted murderer who is out on parole.\n\nthe eagles strong safety told the media that he read about convicted murderer kempis songster who was getting out of prison and decided to reward the killer with super bowl tickets, cbs sports reported.\n\na few weeks ago, i saw an article come across my text that he was getting out, and i wanted to do something special for him, jenkins told the new york daily news on jan. 25. i knew i wanted to do something to celebrate him coming home because i understood he really dedicated himself to a life of service and he's trying to repay what he's taken from society. i know he has some great ideas and we're trying to accomplish the same thing when we talk about reform and healing our communities.\n\njenkins added that instead of giving the tickets to someone who is sick or well deserving, he gave the tickets to the murderer to encourage people to think outside the box and to listen and hear from one another.\n\nthe player concluded saying he is going to lean on the released killer for insight.\n\nbecause he's someone i'm going to lean on for insight of what's going on, who has been through the process, knows what's going on, how people are being affected, jenkins concluded. those are the voices i want to amplify when we talk about trying to change it. you have to be able to engage, and kempis is a great example of that.\n\nkempis songster, who was convicted of murder as a teenager, was released from maximum-security prison early after a recent supreme court decision that mandatory life sentences for minors are unconstitutional. the felon was handed a life sentence in 1988 for murdering another teenager during an argument in a philadelphia crack house, but thanks to the scotus decision he served only 30 years of that sentence.\n\njenkins was one of the first members of the national football league to join former san francisco 49ers second-string quarterback colin kaepernick to protest against the country, our flag, history, and first responders by raising a military black power fist during the playing of the national anthem.\n\njenkins mounted his protests starting in 2016 and continued them throughout the 2017 season until november when he said he decided that the issue was well worn and recognized. he also decided to stop the protests because of the $89 million the league promised to spend on social justice issues and programs.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) reportedly told gop senators that he won't judge anybody for their decision in regards to objecting to the electoral college vote, which congress will count on wednesday, after previously urging them to refrain from doing so.\n\naccording to sen. kevin cramer (r-nd), who recounted the conversation to politico, mcconnell recognized that it is a weighty decision and added that each lawmaker has to make it yourselves.\n\n'i've voted twice on declarations of war.' and he said, 'this is right up there. but … there's a lot of noise out there and i won't judge anybody for their decision,' cramer said of mcconnell.\n\nsen. josh hawley (r-mo) was the first gop senator to announce his intention to object to electoral college votes, formally making the announcement last week:\n\nmillions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard. i will object on january 6 on their behalf pic.twitter.com/ktaappjghe — josh hawley (@hawleymo) december 30, 2020\n\non monday, hawley revealed left-wing activists protested outside of his home, demanding he drop his electoral college challenge, while his wife and newborn were home alone.\n\ntonight while i was in missouri, antifa scumbags came to our place in dc and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can't travel, he announced, adding that they screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.\n\nlet me be clear: my family & i will not be intimidated by leftwing violence, he added:\n\ntonight while i was in missouri, antifa scumbags came to our place in dc and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can't travel. they screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door. let me be clear: my family & i will not be intimidated by leftwing violence — josh hawley (@hawleymo) january 5, 2021\n\non saturday, several gop senators, led by sen. ted cruz (r-tx), released a joint-letter, outlining their intention to object to electors from disputed states unless and until an emergency 10-day audit is completed.\n\nin addition to cruz, senators signing off included ron johnson (r-wi), james lankford (r-ok), steve daines (r-mt), john kennedy (r-la), marsha blackburn (r-tn), mike braun (r-in), cynthia lummis (r-wy), roger marshall (r-ks), bill hagerty (r-tn), and tommy tuberville (r-al).\n\nsen. kelly loeffler (r-ga), who faces off against raphael warnock in tuesday's runoff election, joined her colleagues on monday, stating her intention to vote to give president [donald] trump and the american people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the electoral college certification process on january 6.\n\none republican senator aligned with mcconnell added that the majority leader is letting everybody reach their own conclusion here.\n\nthat's very much his leadership style on issues like this, is to not say much, the lawmaker said, according to politico.\n\ni think he hopes we don't have too many people vote to do this, the lawmaker added. trying to convince people right now wouldn't produce much of a result when you could just give them time to think about it.\n\nmcconnell's hands-off approach follows reports of the majority leader urging members to refrain from challenging the votes, reportedly telling them that an objection isn't in the best interest of everybody, as reported in mid-december.\n\ni think that there was encouragement on the phone for us to accept the result, as much as it's not what we, you know, would have envisioned for the next four years, and to try to do what's best for american people, which is to look forward, sen. shelley moore capito (r-wv) said at the time.\n\nhouse minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-ca), on the other hand, has explicitly approved of the challenge to the electoral college votes, explicitly calling for a debate.\n\ni mean, you see now that senators are going to object, the house is going to object — how else do we have a way to change the election problems? he asked.\n\ntrump, meanwhile, has slammed what he dubbed the surrender caucus within the republican party, warning that it will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective 'guardians' of our nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!:
french president emanuel macron threatened to ban travel from the united kingdom if stricter measures were not enacted to contain the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nin a phone call with boris johnson on friday, macron reportedly informed the british prime minister that should the uk continue with its lax policy on coronavirus, france would be forced to shut off travel from the uk.\n\nwe clearly had to threaten him so that he would finally move, a government official told the french newspaper libération.\n\nconfirming the veracity of the report, a senior french official told politico: we had prepared the closure of our border and told prime minister johnson we would implement it that day if there was no evolution [of british measures].\n\nfollowing the phone call between the two leaders, boris johnson ordered pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas, and other public venues to close. the british government has claimed that the phone call with macron did not influence the decision to enact stricter measures to fight the virus.\n\nas the pm said on friday these new measures were taken based on scientific advice and following the government's action plan set out two weeks ago, a government official said.\n\nuk govt escalated coronavirus response on back of academic's 250,000 deaths warning https://t.co/jbpburww1x — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) march 17, 2020\n\nlast week, the prime minister of france, edouard philippe, said that the uk was not adopting strong enough measures to contain the spread of the virus and warned that a travel ban would be enacted if the situation in the uk did not change.\n\nit goes without saying that if neighbouring states such as the united kingdom spend too long continuing to avoid these containment measures, then we would have difficulty accepting british nationals who would move freely in their own country and then come to our country, philippe said.\n\nfrance has enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures in europe, barring people from leaving their homes for fifteen days. those who do venture outside are required to carry a government form to justify their reason for being outside or face getting fined up to €135 euros.\n\non sunday, 112 people died from coronavirus, bringing the death toll since in the country to 674. the number of confirmed cases in the country rose by over 1,500 over the previous day, with 16,018 people infected with the virus.\n\nin announcing the figures, france's director-general of health, jérôme salomon said: the virus kills and it is continuing to kill.\n\nmacron puts france on 15-day lockdown in coronavirus 'health war' https://t.co/xneimt9qvi — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) march 17, 2020\n\nfollow kurt on twitter at @kurtzindulka
president donald trump may want to send fed chair jerome powell a belated christmas card thanking him for backing off his hawkish stance on monetary policy.\n\nspeaking on a panel in atlanta, flanked by predecessors janet yellen and ben bernanke, powell said the fed's monetary policy is flexible. he acknowledged the december stock market sell-off, saying central bank officials are listening carefully to financial markets.\n\nit was a change of tune for powell. less than a month ago, powell appeared to brush off the downturn in stocks as a little volatility.\n\nfriday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. that seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.\n\nas always, there is no preset path for policy, powell said. and particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.\n\npowell also said that the fed could be flexible on its balance sheet reduction, the unwind of the enormous pile of bonds that it accumulated through its quantitative easing program. last month, he had desribed the balance sheet reduction as being on auto pilot.\n\npowell now vs then: we wouldn't hesitate to make a change if we came to the view that that balance sheet normalization…was part of the problem, we wouldn't hesitate to make a change dec 19: we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot — sara eisen (@saraeisen) january 4, 2019\n\nit worked. stocks rose sharply after the panel. the nasdaq composite, which had been down sharply on thursday, rose by more than 4 percent.\n\nfriday was powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. in mid-december, following the fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in october. that interview with judy woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.\n\ntrump has been saying for several months that he does not think the fed should be raising rates. trump and fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. many fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.\n\nbut with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the fed should rethink its model. the economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. this suggests potential growth may be greater than the fed believed.\n\npowell's comments hinted that he may be moving toward that idea–or at least to being patient and letting more evidence come in.\n\nwe will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate, he said.\n\noddly enough, powell was asked if he would resign if trump demanded it. he said he would not. but after friday's comments and the market's reaction, that scenario now seems even less likely than it ever did.
former u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice recently criticized college basketball rules that prevent student-athletes from making money off merchandise featuring their faces or names, a report says.\n\nrice called the rules incomprehensible but warned that the legal ramifications of the idea needs to be studied before compensation can begin, sporting news reported.\n\nwe believe that students ought to be able to benefit from name, image and likeness but you can't decide a program until you know the legal parameters, rice told usa today in a may 9 interview.\n\napparently speaking on recommendations offered by the commission on college basketball, a group she chaired, rice went on to say that her group could not fully expound on the idea without further study.\n\ni think some of the commentary suggested that we didn't really speak on this issue, rice said. i think we did speak on this issue, it's just that we understand there's a legal framework that has to be developed first.\n\nrice referred to the case of notre dame women's basketball player arike ogunbowale as a perfect example of the confusing ncaa rules on athletes benefitting from their college careers. ogunbowale was granted a waiver from the league so that she could accept payment for being on tv's dancing with the stars. the league quixotically claimed that her basketball career was not the reason she was asked to be on the show. rice claimed the basis for the waiver was absurd.\n\ni couldn't for the life of me understand the explanation, rice said adding, because obviously, she's there because she hit two winning shots in two basketball games (in the women's final four), so that's the connection.\n\nclearly, the rules need to be changed. however, careful thought needs to be put into the mechanics of that change, rice said.\n\nplayers have been trying to get the league to change the rules on benefitting from their likeness for some time. there were two recent federal lawsuits on the matter.\n\none was a case brought by former ucla basketball player ed o'bannon who filed suit claiming that college players ought to be compensated when schools use their names and likenesses for advertising. in 2016, o'bannon tried to get the u.s. supreme court to take the case, but the court refused his entreaty. the high court's move left in place a lower court ruling from 2015 that favored o'bannon, though it was a decision that did not satisfy advocates for college athletes to make money from advertising.\n\nanother suit was filed by former arizona state quarterback sam keller who wanted to be compensated by a video game company for its use of his likeness and name in a video football game. in 2014, the ncaa announced it had reached a $20 million settlement in the case.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston.
southampton, england, feb. 18 (upi) — researchers in england have outfitted unmanned micro air vehicles with new wings inspired by bats.\n\nthe membrane wings are without mechanical components, making them lighter and more flexible. voltage inputs manipulate the wings mid-flight, allowing them to function like artificial muscles and change shape in response to shifting aerodynamic forces.\n\nmavs using the new, more economical wings use less energy and are able to make longer flights.\n\na team of researchers from the university of southampton and imperial college london have been working to incorporate the physiology of bats into unmanned aerial vehicle and mav technology.\n\nhigh-speed cameras and computer models have allowed scientists to observe and mimic the aerodynamic advantages of bat wings.\n\nwe've successfully demonstrated the fundamental feasibility of mavs incorporating wings that respond to their environment, just like those of the bats that have fueled our thinking, bharath ganapathisubramani, project leader and southampton professor, said in a news release.\n\nwe've also shown in laboratory trials that active wings can dramatically alter the performance, he said. the combined computational and experimental approach that characterized the project is unique in the field of bio-inspired mav design.\n\nganapathisubramani and his colleagues are now working on incorporating the wings into current commercial mav designs.\n\nthis is a paradigm shift in the approach to mav design, project researcher rafael palacios said. instead of a traditional approach of scaling down existing aircraft design methods, we constantly change the membrane shape under varying wind conditions to optimize its aerodynamic performance.
the mispronunciation of a first name, a recycled power point presentation, and a toddler's taste in footwear all factored in nike losing the nba's biggest star to rival under armour.\n\nin a long exploration of nike's major mistake, espn's ethan sherwood strauss noted the sportswear leader muffed its chance to secure curry in its stable of big name basketball athletes through a long series of missteps that showed the company's blasé indifference to his rising star.\n\nsince his nba debut as a first round, seventh overall pick in 2009, curry has become one of the most exciting players on the hardwoods. in fact, the young north carolinian is already being considered one of the greatest shooters of all time. he has amassed many accolades and helped lead the warriors to the nba championship in 2015. along with being the nba's most valuable player that year he is also a three times nba all-star from 2014 to 2016. and that is just to start as he has a long list of achievements going back to college.\n\nas to his sportswear contract, it is reported that curry's worth to under armour (ua) is an amazing $14 billion.\n\non march 3, 2016, business insider noted that curry has been a boon to ua. ua's u.s. basketball shoe sales have increased over 350 percent ytd. its stephen curry signature shoe business is already bigger than those of lebron, kobe and every other player except michael jordan. if curry is the next jordan, our call will likely be wrong.\n\nbut as espn's strauss reports, nike had its chance to keep curry in its stable of nba stars and muffed the whole deal from word go.\n\nas strauss continued his report, he revealed that nike didn't bother to offer curry the chance to lead a training camp — something he really wanted to do — didn't give him much personal attention, delivered a power point presentation with kevin durant's name in it, and even mispronounced his name during a pitch session!\n\neven after curry announced he wanted to go with ua in 2013 nike still had an opportunity to keep him on its team by matching the mere $4 million offer ua had given him to kick off their association. and as strauss notes, $4 million is chump change to a company worth $16 billion.\n\nby some accounts, losing curry was one of nike's biggest goofs. as strauss notes, sonny vaccaro said, this is nike's biggest fear. they can't overcome this in the shoe business. this is going to be detrimental to them. psychologically.\n\nbut maybe nike was never in the running in the first place. all because curry's one-year-old toddler made the final decision.\n\nmy favorite story is riley, curry has said of his early decision process. strauss goes on to explain, it's a few weeks before a final decision on the shoe contract must be made. at his agent jeff austin's house in hermosa beach, california, curry surveys the array of shoes before him. he asks his baby daughter, 'riley, which one do you like?'\n\nat this point, riley is little over 1 year old. she is presented with a nike sneaker, an adidas sneaker and an under armour sneaker. she picks up shoe one, a nike. threw it over her shoulder, curry says. she picked up shoe two, threw it over her shoulder. she picked up the third shoe, walked over and handed it to me. it was the under armour anatomix spawn. so i knew right then, curry says, smiling.\n\nhowever it went down, the fact remains that steph curry has become one of the most amazing young players in the nba and under armour is laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
madrid (ap) — if you're taking a bus in the spanish capital, be sure to keep your legs to yourself.\n\nmadrid authorities on monday started putting up signs banning the practice of 'manspreading' — opening one's legs so wide you invade other's seating space —on city buses as part of their new etiquette guidelines.\n\nemt municipal transportation company says the sign is designed to discourage physical postures that bother people.\n\nthe sign features an illustration of a man with splayed legs with a red 'x' above. the text beneath urges passengers to respect the space of others.\n\nthere are no sanctions or fines for those indulging in the practice.\n\nthe bus company incorporated the ban following an internet signature campaign by a woman's group, mujeres en lucha (fighting women).\n\nin their campaign petition, the women said it was a very common practice.\n\nla @emtmadrid añade una nueva señal a bordo del bus para evitar el #manspreading: respeta el espacio de los demás. https://t.co/xg5lfwb4ta pic.twitter.com/ksyeu45gai — ayuntamiento madrid (@madrid) june 6, 2017\n\nit's not difficult to see women with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because there's a man beside them who's invading their space with their legs, it added.\n\nthe group said women were taught to sit with their legs together whereas men are ingrained with the idea of territorial hierarchy, as if the space belongs to them.\n\nemt said it felt its initiative, which also includes asking passengers not to eat or drink on buses, to keep their backpacks on or put their feet up on seats, was being well received. again, there are no sanctions for any of these other requests.\n\nwhen a person opens their legs so wide it disturbs others, this is rude, said alvaro gomez jordana moya, 60, as he waited for a bus in madrid. it's also uncomfortable having to ask someone, 'please, can you close your legs'.\n\nit's a problem because people don't respect seating, said another bus passenger maria carmen ventosa, 46. it should change things, if only out of respect for others.\n\nmadrid's underground train company said it had no plans to follow suit.

the public university of oregon spent $23,000 on research before deciding whether to change the name of several buildings on campus, which students claim have racist histories.\n\na black student group at the university of oregon demanded that campus buildings be renamed after uncovering that several of the buildings are named after men with controversial histories.\n\ndunn hall, a prominent building on campus, is set to be renamed after the students uncovered that the building's namesake was once a member of the ku klux klan.\n\ndespite the concerns of the students, it's unclear why administrators poured such a significant amount of funds into research on the decision.\n\nthe report was one of several inputs the president considered in his deliberations, but he was very appreciative of the thoughtful approach taken by the historians, argued university spokesman tobin klinger.\n\nthey are used at the discretion of the president for a variety of purposes for the advancement of the organization, he added.\n\ndunn hall will be renamed for a man or woman whose life exemplifies the characteristics of racial diversity and inclusion that dunn despised, according to university president michael schill, who oversaw the process.\n\nin addition to the questionable funding decision made on researching the decision to rename buildings, the university has plans to build a $3 million black cultural center.\n\naccording to a press release, the center will be an engine for black students' academic success, providing the room and resources to grow stronger intellectually, ethically, physically and as a community, and will connect black students with resources for student success and leadership, as well as serve as a site for seminars and programs that serve the uo and all of oregon.\n\ntom ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for breitbart news. you can follow him on twitter @tciccotta or email him at tciccotta@breitbart.com
a michigan state representative wants residents to go to restaurants and order big the day after gov. gretchen whitmer's (d-mi) latest lockdown is scheduled to end.\n\nstate rep. john damoose (r) is introducing a resolution to declare january 16 restaurant dine-in day, he told the kyle olson show this week.\n\nwhitmer's mid-november three-week pause — which banned in-person dining and has been extended twice — is slated to end january 15.\n\ni talked to so many restaurant owners who said, 'okay, i guess we can open on this date and it was less than 48 hours prior to the expiration that this was extended all the day [sic] to january 15,' and these businesses, you know what they did? they went out and stocked up, they got their workforce ready to go, and then they got the rug pulled out from them, damoose said.\n\nall the stuff they bought spoiled, so it's just like adding insult to injury, he said.\n\nhe said of his resolution, which will be introduced on january 13 — the first day of the new session — it's entirely positive. we're living up to her extension to the 15th, fine, whatever. we don't agree with it, but we're going to live up to it. now, we're going to go out and celebrate these businesses.\n\ndamoose acknowledged a resolution does not do much, but the intent is to set the tone that we're serious about this.\n\nhe said many other representatives are rallying behind it, and some of these restaurants are just plain happy to see someone supporting them.\n\ndamoose told the kyle olson show that businesses and residents have been met with hostile message after hostile message from whitmer and her administration.\n\ni think it's time we change our tone, he said, and thank residents for complying with the orders for so long.\n\ndamoose represents the northern lower peninsula and southern upper peninsula, including the tourist destination of mackinac island. he said those locations were able to get by in 2020, but many of them are wondering if they will be able to stay open if the restrictions continue much longer.\n\nhe said one way the legislature can restore some balance and decrease whitmer acting unilaterally is to use her administration's funding as a lever.\n\nwe do control the power of the purse, damoose said. reining in health and human services, we do control their budget, he said.\n\nthat is the department that began issuing restrictions after the state supreme court ruled whitmer's executive orders unconstitutional in october.\n\ndamoose noted the chairman of the house appropriations committee said future funding would be tied to repealing lockdown orders.\n\nas for the restaurant dine-in day on january 16, he encouraged residents to order big and tip lots.\n\nkyle olson is a reporter for breitbart news. he is also host of the kyle olson show, syndicated on michigan radio stations on saturdays — download full podcast episodes. follow him on parler.
thousands of saudi women are now enjoying the right to attend football matches among other basic improvements in women's rights under the crown prince mohammed bin salman's modernization program.\n\nin january, women were finally allowed to attend a match alongside men at the king abdullah sports city stadium in jeddah, although they had to enter through a separate turnstile.\n\nit means that i am human, secondary school teacher nora told sky news at a riyadh derby game. no other can prevent me from doing what i want. no other [can] decide what i want. i am the one who decides.\n\nthis event proves that we are heading for a prosperous future, 32-year-old lamya khaled nasser told agence france press. i am very proud to be a witness to this massive change.\n\nthe decision allowing women to attend football matches followed the announcement last year that the ban on women drivers will also be lifted.\n\ni will be ecstatic, i will be happy. i will be sad for all the years that passed in my life that i wasn't able to do such basic elementary step of mobility, said madeha al ajroush, a women's rights activist who has previously been jailed for driving a car in protest.\n\nat 18, women usually automatically get behind the wheel and drive and do their errands, she continued. i had to wait until i was 63. that saddens me [that] they took away a lot from my life.\n\nthe loosening of restrictions falls in line with the crown prince's modernization movement known as the vision 2030 economic program, which saudi leadership officially approved last april. as well as promoting economic growth, the program also intends to liberalize many of the country's islamic conditions.\n\nlast year alone, authorities legalized yoga, held their first women's basketball tournament, and made roles available for women to work in the ministry of justice. the kingdom has also recently lifted a 35-year ban on commercial cinemas, with the company vue cinemas this week announcing plans to open 30 cinemas over the next three years.\n\nhowever, the country's human rights record still remains well below that of many of its allies, with citizens regularly arrested and detained for crimes such as religious blasphemy, criticising the government, or dressing inappropriately.\n\nmohammed bin salman's newfound authority has also been characterized by the sweeping arrests of dozens of saudi businessmen, officials, and even royalty on corruption charges, although many of them have since been released.\n\nfollow ben kew on facebook, on twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
las vegas (ap) — bernie sanders scored a resounding victory in nevada's presidential caucuses on saturday, cementing his status as the democrats' national front-runner amid escalating tensions over whether he's too liberal to defeat president donald trump.\n\nthe 78-year-old vermont senator successfully rallied his fiercely loyal base and tapped into support from nevada's large latino community as the democratic contest moved for the first time into a state with a significant minority population.\n\nthe win built on sanders' win earlier this month in the new hampshire primary. he essentially tied for first place in the iowa caucuses with pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, indiana, who has sought to position himself as an ideological counter to sanders' unabashed progressive politics, but was fighting for a distant second place in nevada.\n\nthe victory, while encouraging for sanders supporters, only deepens concern among establishment-minded democratic leaders who fear that the self-described democratic socialist is too extreme to defeat trump. sanders for decades has been calling for transformative policies to address inequities in politics and the economy, none bigger than his signature medicare for all health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.\n\ndespite establishment anxiety, moderates are struggling to unify behind a single candidate, and the vote on saturday was again split between several centrists, including buttigieg and former vice president joe biden.\n\nalso in the mix: massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who desperately needed a spark to revive her stalled bid; billionaire tom steyer, who spent more than $12 million on nevada television, and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, who hoped to prove her strong new hampshire finish was no fluke.\n\nafter the chaos of iowa's caucuses, there were concerns about nevada's similar setup. but no major problems were in sight.\n\nat noon, under sunny skies, dozens of uniformed housekeepers and casino workers cast ballots in the bellagio, one of seven casino-resorts on the las vegas strip among 200 locations statewide that hosted caucuses. nevada is the third contest on a 2020 election calendar marked by chaos and uncertainty after the opening votes in iowa and new hampshire, overwhelmingly white, rural states.\n\nthe first presidential contest in the west is testing the candidates' strength with black and latino voters for the first time in 2020. nevada's population aligns more with the u.s. as a whole, compared with iowa and new hampshire: 29% latino, 10% black and 9% asian american and pacific islander.\n\nself-described democratic socialist bernie sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the race so far as a half-dozen more-moderate candidates criticize one another. each wants to be the preferred alternative to the vermont senator in the race to take on president donald trump in november.\n\nin a show of confidence, sanders left nevada early to rally supporters in texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on super tuesday. the progressive senator told cheering supporters in el paso that trump is a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.\n\nwhen we come together there is nothing we can't accomplish, sanders declared.\n\nthe nevada verdict represents the third in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several u.s. territories, ending only at the party's national convention in july. but with two more rounds of voting scheduled over the next 10 days — including super tuesday's massive delegate haul — the party may identify a consensus candidate long before the convention.\n\nsanders and his allies were increasingly confident about his strength in the race. in nevada, he has strong support from latinos and rank-and-file union workers who have warmed to his calls to transform the nation's economy and political system to help the working class.\n\nthere was skepticism about pete buttigieg's ability to win over a more diverse set of voters after strong finishes in iowa and new hampshire. joe biden, who struggled in those early states, looked to nevada's voters of color to prove he still has a viable path to the nomination.\n\nelizabeth warren and klobuchar were fighting for momentum, hoping to benefit from a sudden surge of outside money from newly created super pacs.\n\nklobuchar, campaigning in her home state of minnesota saturday night, claimed nevada success no matter what. as usual i think we have exceeded expectations.\n\nnew york billionaire mike bloomberg, who dominated the political conversation this week after a poor debate-stage debut, wasn't on the ballot. he's betting everything on a series of delegate-rich states that begin voting next month.\n\nbillionaire tom steyer spent more than $12 million of his own money on television advertising in nevada, according to data obtained by the associated press.\n\ntrump weighed in on social media, continuing his weeks-long push to sow discord between sanders and his democratic rivals.\n\nlooks like crazy bernie is doing well in the great state of nevada. biden & the rest look weak, trump tweeted. congratulations bernie, & don't let them take it away from you!\n\nthe stakes were high for nevada democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in iowa, and it appeared saturday's caucuses were largely successful.\n\nthe developer the nevada democrats had planned to use had its mobile app fail spectacularly in iowa. nearly three weeks later, iowa democratic officials have yet to post final results. but resources poured into nevada, as democrats realized they could ill afford another poorly executed election.\n\nunlike state primaries and the november election, which are run by government officials, caucuses are overseen by state parties.\n\nnevada democrats sought to minimize problems by creating multiple redundancies in their reporting system, relying on results called in by phone, a paper worksheet filled out by caucus organizers, a photo of that worksheet sent in by text message and electronic results captured with a google form. they relied on trusted commercial tech that appeared to smooth the process.\n\nin addition, it appeared nevada democrats were able to successfully navigate a complicated process for adding early voting to the caucus process. nearly 75,000 people cast early ballots over a four-day period, and the party was able to process those in time for saturday so they could be integrated into the in-person vot.\n\nat the bellagio caucus site, 41-year-old christian nielsen, a scuba diver for the cirque du soleil show o, saidhe backed sanders because he believes the country needs a major change in the white house.\n\nwe need somebody in the white house who has been on the right side of history for their entire career, somebody who stands with the working class, and will make things more fair for everybody, nielsen said.\n\nthe democrats' 2020 nomination fight shifted beyond nevada even before the final results were known.\n\nonly biden, buttigieg and steyer were still in the state when news of sanders' victory was announced.\n\nsanders and klobuchar spent the night in super tuesday states. and warren, who began saturday in las vegas, was to finish the day in washington state, which hosts its election on march 10 but has already begun offering early voting.\n\n___\n\npeoples and jaffe reported from washington. associated press writer christina a.

house speaker rep. paul ryan wants congress to pass a law that would cause puerto rico bondholders who own $73 billion in notes from the territory's government to be treated the same way the federal government treated chrysler bondholders back in 2008 and 2009.\n\nfriday morning, ryan addressed a special meeting of the gop caucus to attempt to persuade recalcitrant conservatives the cram down is a good idea.\n\nif the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act (promesa) rep. sean duffy has sponsored and ryan supports becomes law, puerto rico would use the special dispensation provided the territory in the bill to force bondholders to accept pennies on the dollar prior to or during a bankruptcy filing.\n\nas george mason university professor todd zywicki and the heritage foundation's james sherk wrote of the chrysler bondholder cram down:\n\nin bankruptcy, the secured status of these bonds should have meant that the secured creditors would be paid in full before any money was allocated to subordinate creditors, such as the uaw's veba plans. instead, the plan imposed by the government forced chrysler's secured creditors to accept only 29 cents on the dollar, while the uaw recovered most of the value of its claims.\n\nas breitbart news reported previously, if promesa passes, puerto rico's bondholders would receive the same kind of treatment as chrysler's bondholders.\n\n[the] plan that would let puerto rico wipe out $33 billion of its $73 billion debt in bankruptcy.\n\nleadership of both political parties are backing the creation of a federal control board and legal authorization for puerto rico to file bankruptcy. the effort would pave the way for a cramdown of about 45 percent of the island's debt, without any spending cuts.\n\nconservatives in the house say that's a bad idea.\n\nryan is technically right that the promesa bill is not the same kind of immediate bailout of billions in direct loans to puerto rico as the 2008 auto bailout of chrysler and general motors, a good portion of which was subsequently written off.\n\nbut in many respects, his argument today echoes the words of former president george w. bush, who defended the tarp bailout of banks that he later used to bail out the auto companies when he infamously said: i've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.\n\nryan's need to intervene in order to save the increasingly unpopular puerto rico bailout is urgent.\n\non wednesday, the house natural resources committee rejected promesa in a surprise move, preventing it from coming to the floor of the house for a vote.\n\nthe bill's passage through the committee was expected to be a slam dunk.\n\nas recently as tuesday, a confident natural resources committee chairman, rep. rob bishop, said it is the island's best shot to mitigate its financial collapse and future calls for a bailout, which would be untenable. congress must act now to avoid a humanitarian crisis that will severely impact 3.5 million americans living in puerto rico and millions of americans on the mainland.\n\nthe bill's sponsor, rep. sean duffy, was equally confident:\n\nthe three and a half million americans living in the u.s. territory deserve the attention and support of congress. after decades of mismanagement, puerto rico's investors also deserve better. a protracted and chaotic legal battle would not serve the interest of creditors or the island. worse would be a mutli-billion dollar taxpayer bailout thrust on the shoulders of america's taxpayers and retirees. the promesa act will ensure that the island meets its debt obligations in a controlled, responsible manner, without saddling the u.s. taxpayers with the bill. if we get this right, we have an opportunity to put the people of puerto rico on a path to economic opportunity. however, if we do nothing, the american people will be on the hook.\n\nbut that confidence evaporated in 48 fast moving hours.\n\nas the hill reported:\n\nspeaker paul ryan (r-wis.) will try to sell fellow republicans on a bill to help puerto rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting friday. ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to puerto rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. a lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said thursday. it is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of puerto rico. the members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. the fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late wednesday, when the house natural resources committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. republicans said the delay was spurred by democrats in congress and the obama administration. committee chairman rob bishop (r-utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. and ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because democrats were not willing to back it. but a wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . the current bill does not commit any federal funds to puerto rico. instead, it establishes an outside control board to monitor the island's finances, and allows the island to go to court to try and restructure some of its debt if voluntary negotiations with creditors fail.\n\non thursday, ryan gave an advance preview of his pitch:\n\nthere is chaos occurring. puerto rico passed a law negating, arguably, their debt. we want to bring order to the chaos. and the need for puerto rican legislation is to bring order to the chaos. and my number one priority as speaker of the house with respect to this issue is to keep the american taxpayer away from this. there will no taxpayer bailout. we want an oversight board, just like we did with the district of columbia a number of years ago, to be involved, to provide the kind of leadership and structure that is necessary for puerto rico to gets its own fiscal house in order and to guide the kind of debt restructuring that is necessary so that puerto rico can continue to access the capital markets and keep the taxpayer out of this. that is our primary responsibility is to protect the american taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall puerto rico if the status quo continues going in the direction it's going.\n\nryan took exception to television ads calling promesa a bailout of puerto rico:\n\ni'm not going to characterize who is behind what ads because i don't know who is behind what ads. a bailout is getting the taxpayer involved. we are — our whole entire purpose of this is to prevent the taxpayer from getting involved and not having a taxpayer bailout. that is why we are going the path we are going to prevent to taxpayer from being involved in this.\n\nwhat ryan fails to note is that puerto rico has been a regular recipient of funds from federal taxpayers for years, and promesa will do nothing to change that pattern of support.\n\nin fact, congress is currently considering a separate proposal to increase federal subsidies directly to puerto rico residents through the extension of earned income tax credits. that's a neat trick, especially since residents of puerto rico currently do not have to file or pay any federal taxes.\n\nin 2013, the federal government spent $2 billion on food stamps to residents of puerto rico, and that amount appears to be increasing with each additional year.\n\nan estimated one-third of the island's residents receive food stamps.\n\nforbes contributor martin sullivan argues that puerto rico is already receiving $8 billion in subsidies from an obsure irs ruling:\n\nthere's no one in the administration or in d.c. that's contemplating a federal bailout of puerto rico, white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters on june 29. that statement is simply false. it may be true that the treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for puerto rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for u.s. companies operating in puerto rico on a puerto rican tax designed to give those companies u.s. tax credits. sound complicated? yep. that's why nobody is paying attention. think about it this way: puerto rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. u.s. companies operating there are just the middlemen. here are the details. since 2011, approximately 20 percent of puerto rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in puerto rico. . . now here's the financial magic. on march 30, 2011, the irs released notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against u.s. taxes. the notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the excise tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. until these issues were resolved, the irs would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. further, if the irs decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively. thus, most of the new tax burden imposed on multinationals doing business in puerto rico was eliminated by treasury.\n\nin 2008, president george w. bush acknowledged that he abandoned free market principles when he tried to sell the tarp bailout to the american people.\n\nat least president bush was honest about what he had done.\n\nspeaker ryan, it seems, wants to obscure the real consequences of promesa as he tries to sell it to his house colleagues.
matt damon is jumping to the defense of fellow actor sean penn amid mounting criticism of penn's clandestine exclusive interview for rolling stone with violent mexican drug kingpin joaquín el chapo guzmán loera.\n\nbackstage at sunday's golden globe awards, after he was named best actor in a motion picture musical or comedy for the martian, damon said he had yet to read penn's in-depth interview with the former fugitive.\n\ni haven't read it yet; i definitely plan to, said damon, according to variety. i subscribe to rolling stone, so it's already been sent to me.\n\nthe actor then defended penn's actions, saying, but look, it's nothing new, actors going and seeking out meetings like this.\n\nit's part of what we do in our job really well and sean somehow figured out that he had an audience with this person and i'm sure was pursuing something creatively and thought a meeting with him would be valuable, so he did it, said damon.\n\nmeanwhile, former talk show host and current fox news personality gerlado rivera took to his twitter page to defend penn and to place some of the blame for the atrocities carried out by el chapo's sinoloa drug cartel on the united states.\n\nif it hasnt happened already it will soon #elchapo will be replaced by other drug kingpins as long as usa keep spending billions to get high — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 10, 2016\n\nfolks getting mad at penn cause he got chummy w el chapo why?penn wasnt acting as a journalist he was one risking alot to get huge exclusive — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 10, 2016\n\nmystifying how outraged so many are at @seanpenn is it because he's a lefty? it certainly c/n be because he intv'd world's most wanted man. — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 11, 2016\n\nel chapo escaped from a maximum security mexican prison in july of last year, but he was recaptured on friday. his drug cartel is believed to be responsible for thousands of violent murders.\n\nin october, penn traveled to mexico, where he interviewed el chapo for rolling stone. that interview was published on saturday, a day after the drug lord was arrested following a firefight with authorities in the northwest mexican town of los mochis.\n\nrecounting a harrowing journey including remote locations, guns, and throw away cell phones, penn described the drug lord as a humble, rural mexican, whose perception of his place in the world offers a window into an extraordinary riddle of cultural disparity.\n\ndo you dream? …do you have hopes for your life? …if you could change the world, would you? were a few of the questions penn asked the fugitive, who was also allotted editorial control of the interview's first draft.\n\nin the interview, el chapo also brags to penn that he supplies more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world, and expresses no remorse for the violent actions carried out on his behalf.\n\nrolling stone's decision to allow penn, who is not a journalist, the opportunity to interview el chapo is leading to criticism, as is the publication's decision to give the cartel leader editorial control over the interview.\n\ndespite efforts by both penn and el chapo's people to cover their digital tracks to protect the fugitive drug lord's location from law enforcement, penn's actions reportedly unwittingly helped authorities capture the cartel leader.\n\na source told breitbart texas el chapo likely would not have been captured had it not been for penn's meeting, as authorities were able to identify hundreds of radios and cell phones and get a complete map of targets for electronic intel collection.
rhode island bishop thomas tobin has registered his frustration with the democrats' abortion extremism, wondering aloud why pro-lifers are no longer welcome in the party.\n\nas the presidential primary shifts to new england, it's sad to note that all of the major democratic candidates are pro-abortion, supporting even partial-birth abortion, wrote the redoubtable bishop tobin in a tweet wednesday.\n\nwhere are pro-life democrats supposed to turn? or are pro-life voters not welcome in the democratic party? he continued.\n\nas the presidential primary shifts to new england, it's sad to note that all of the major democratic candidates are pro-abortion, supporting even partial-birth abortion. where are pro-life democrats supposed to turn? or are pro-life voters not welcome in the democratic party? — bishop thomas tobin (@thomasjtobin1) february 5, 2020\n\nin early 2017, dnc chairman tom perez established an abortion litmus test for the party, effectively ruling out the possibility of pro-life democrats.\n\nevery democrat, like every american, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, perez said at the time. that is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.\n\nat a time when women's rights are under assault from the white house, the republican congress, and in states across the country, he added, we must speak up for this principle as loudly as ever and with one voice.\n\nat that time, perez became the first chairman of the party to require absolute ideological purity on abortion rights, promising to only back democratic candidates who embrace a woman's right to choose to eliminate her child.\n\nthe official 2016 platform of the democratic party has been dubbed the most pro-abortion platform in history, and the president of naral pro-choice america ilyse hogue called the 55-page document far and away the most progressive platform on reproductive health, freedom and justice in the history of the party.\n\ndemocrat presidential hopeful pete buttigieg recently confirmed the party's intransigent pro-abortion position, effectively ruling out the possibility of pro-life democrats.\n\ni am pro-choice, and i believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision, buttigieg said in a fox news town hall in iowa when questioned about the party's lack of diversity regarding abortion.\n\nin response, kristen day, executive director of democrats for life of america, threatened to withdraw support from candidates who would exclude pro-life democrats from the party.\n\nwe've had enough, ms. day told catholic news agency (cna) following her personal encounter with buttigieg, who said he would be willing to live without the support of pro-life voters in order to maintain his total support for abortion-on-demand.\n\nin her interview, day expressed her chagrin over the democrats' slavery to the abortion industry, noting that pro-life democrats are simply fed up.\n\nthese presidential candidates are so afraid of the abortion lobby that they will make no room for pro-life democrats, she said, because they're afraid that they're going to lose all their money and support.\n\ni just wanted to know if he [buttigieg] thought there was room for us in the party. and he doesn't, she said.\n\nthe party's abortion extremism, she said, is not going to be a good long-term strategy for them.\n\nmany catholics have also registered their exasperation with the democrats' alliance with abortion industry, echoing the position of bishop tobin.\n\ni am convinced that the democratic party has moved so far away from moral decency that it's impossible for any catholic to make the case, in a reasonable way, for why it's okay for him/her to remain a democrat, and vote for democrat politicians, wrote catholic author shane schaetzel in 2019.\n\nhow could any catholic be supportive of a party, and politicians, who advocate and facilitate the wholesale slaughter of innocent human life? he asked.\n\nfollow @tdwilliamsrome
after experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) upon retiring from the u.s. army, a veteran launched a martial arts fight club to aid other veterans to address their own issues.\n\nveteran todd vance served in the army, beginning after the attacks on september 11 until his retirement in 2005. in service, he led over 250 missions as a squad leader. but, when he returned home, he began to flounder when back in society.\n\nin an interview with cnn, vance noted that he was excited to leave the service and get back home. but it wasn't long before things began to overwhelm him. at first, it was all elation. i was just happy to be alive and happy to be out of the military, vance said. slowly but surely, reality was setting in about what i had seen and what i had done.\n\nit wasn't long before vance was drinking too much. he became withdrawn but eventually decided something had to change.\n\nafter his diagnosis with ptsd, vance began training in martial arts, and said it changed his life. it gave me the structure, the discipline, the camaraderie, the routine that i needed to have in my life that i was missing so much from the military. before training, i had no reason not to drink until 3 in the morning. i was training six days a week, often two times a day, and eating clean,  he said.\n\nsoon, the veteran began to wonder if his experience could be replicated by others who suffer ptsd.\n\nby 2012 vance had created pugilistic offensive warrior tactics (p.o.w.), a non-profit organization aimed at helping soldiers address their symptoms of ptsd and to adjust back to civilian life.\n\nmartial arts is focused on technique and fitness. … we have served more than 275 veterans, and all the success stories we have is a testament to the effectiveness of the program, vance said. we see people get right out of the military, they're young, they're a mess, they don't have any employment or social skills. two or three years later, they are working on their master's degree.\n\nvance says his group works well for those who commit to the program. a study of 30 participants showed a 90 percent improvement in physical health and an 80 percent relief of symptoms of ptsd.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
an alabama teacher says school officials told her monday to remove a shirt with the words just pray on it because the shirt violated the school dress code.\n\nchris burrell, who works as a teacher in the mobile county school district, told wala she wore the shirt to support a local 11-year-old girl diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year.\n\nan organization called aubreigh's army designed the shirt to raise money for the girl, aubreigh nicholas, who had been receiving treatment. the organization's crowdfunding page for aubreigh's treatment raised $45,645 as of saturday afternoon.\n\nthe school principal, allegedly unaware the shirt was to support a crowdfunding campaign, asked burrell to go home and change her shirt to reflect the school's dress code.\n\nmobile county school district superintendent martha peek said burrell's shirt violated the dress code because it reflected certain beliefs.\n\nwe have to be cognizant of everyone's beliefs or everyone's thoughts in a public school, peek told wala.\n\nburrell wrote a facebook post, which received approximately 800 shares before she deleted it, saying she did not intend to promote religion by wearing the shirt.\n\ni didn't think twice about it. i wasn't trying to promote religion; it was just my monday feel-good shirt. burrell wrote.\n\nthe school district reportedly did not take further action against burrell after asking her to change her shirt.\n\nwe're totally supporting her, said peek. i think that this was just an unfortunate connection there, but still the principal would have had to exercise her judgment.
the wall street journal (wsj) noted on thursday that crown prince mohammed bin salman (mbs) is pushing a return to the tolerant, moderate islam that is open to the world, to all the religions and traditions of its people as part of saudi arabia's major economic reform plan.\n\nat the heart of saudi arabia's recent cultural and political upheaval is an understanding that the country must become more compatible with the western world and more hospitable to foreign investment, in order to manage the transition away from an oil-based economy with limitless deep pockets. possibly the trickiest aspect of this transformation will be an islamic reformation in the notoriously strict kingdom.\n\nas the journal goes on to note, mbs is looking quite a way back into history for that memory of moderate saudi islam, since its harsh blend of strict wahhabi islam was brewed up in the 18th century by the eponymous cleric mohammed ibn abd al-wahhab. tribal influences, and of course the presence of islam's holy cities of mecca and medina, have pushed the kingdom in an islamist direction ever since.\n\nthe key event in recent saudi islamic history is often underappreciated by outside observers: the siege of the grand mosque in mecca, in which militants occupied the holiest shrine of islam for 15 days in 1979. the wsj mentions it only briefly, but the siege dovetailed with the revolution in iran to change both the sunni and shiite wings of the islamic world.\n\nit is best understood as a theocratic coup, and not an unsuccessful one because it permanently altered the relationship between saudi arabia's royal family, secular bureaucracy, and hardline islamist clergy. the government did much to curry favor with the wahhabi extremists to prevent anything like the grand mosque attack from happening again. the most pessimistic interpretation of the aftermath is that fundamentalists effectively blackmailed the wealthy saudi government into bankrolling extremism and terrorism. the siege made the government look weak, dishonest, and decadent to many saudis.\n\nthe grand mosque terrorist incident was also a landmark moment in deteriorating relations between saudi arabia and iran, and by extension sunni and shiite islam, since iran was widely believed to be involved in the attack. a dismal contest between saudi arabia and iran began to demonstrate which was more pious and faithful to islamic law. fundamentalism spread rapidly across formerly liberal and cosmopolitan cities across the middle east, which until the islamist upheaval of the late seventies resembled american and european cities of the same era. it didn't help matters that islamic fundamentalism mixed easily with marxist quackery.\n\nsome find the speed of crown prince mohammed bin salman's reforms astonishing, or worry that he is moving too quickly, but margherita stancati at the wall street journal recalls that fundamentalism descended upon saudi arabia very quickly forty years ago:\n\nthe mixing of unrelated men and women, let alone singing and dancing, was no longer acceptable. cinemas closed and music stopped. in public, women were forced to wear face-covering veils, which in parts of the country such as asir had been virtually nonexistent. the religious police, formally known as the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice, was given the job of enforcing the new order. radical islamists infused the school curriculum with the teachings of wahhabi scholars. textbooks instructed students to hate christians and jews and denigrated shiite muslims. some of the more extreme views often came from teachers, who sometimes recruited students to extremist causes. saudi charities linked to the government helped spread that interpretation of islam beyond the kingdom's borders, inspiring generations of jihadists.\n\nas stancati notes, even young women eager for reform in saudi arabia today grew up being taught that drawing pictures of animals was an insult to allah's sacred and unique ability to create life, or that listening to music for pleasure would get them tortured for all eternity in the afterlife by having hot metal poured in their ears. top saudi clerics criticized the government for giving women the right to drive by saying it would give them easy access to worldly temptation, and as we know, women are weak and easily tempted.\n\nhowever, the saudi public overwhelmingly supports ending the ban on women drivers. younger saudis in particular grasp that they need to become more socially compatible with the rest of the world if they are to compete on the global stage, in an era when oil is no longer the bottomless spring of easy money it once was.\n\ncrucially, there does not seem to be any massive fundamentalist pushback lurking, comparable to how saudi modernization at the beginning of the oil boom fed the resentments that erupted in 1979. the government is making a serious effort to nourish more moderate interpretations of islam and improve education.\n\ngranted, some of the social liberalization described by stancati is incremental, such as upscale riyadh women getting to decide what color fabric they wish to be wrapped in from head to toe, instead of having to settle for all black. also, liberalization in the big saudi cities is much more noticeable than in small towns and distant areas.\n\nretired pacific fleet commander admiral james lyons noted in the washington times in december that saudi demographics are now remarkably skewed toward the younger generation, as 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old, and they have little patience for onerous islamic restrictions. he also noted that the post-oil saudi economy will have to welcome women into the workforce, which necessarily involves lifting restrictions upon them, such as allowing them to drive.\n\nlyons is willing to cut the crown prince a lot of slack for playing rough as he consolidates power, because it's necessary to implement rapid reforms against bureaucratic and social inertia in saudi arabia. there is also some comfort in knowing that mbs has practical dollars-and-cents reasons to make his reforms stick; if his sense of idealism flags, the sound of a doomsday clock ticking on a trillion-dollar economic collapse should strengthen his resolve.
san bernardino county supervisor robert lovingood wants to arm all eligible citizens — including county workers — in a bid to prevent or stall another terrorist attack in san bernardino.\n\nfox la reports that lovingood wants citizens to get concealed carry permits, and he wants to see a change in policy at county offices that will allow county workers to volunteer to become authorized to carry concealed weapons as well. and it appears many san bernardino county residents are thinking the same way. for example, waiting times for concealed carry permits in san bernardino county have spiked from 3 months before the shooting, to more than a year, due to the flood of applicants.\n\naccording to the desert sun, the san bernardino sheriff's department received 75 applications [for concealed carry] during the weekend following the attack, when it normally averages 10. by the end of the month, deputies had received 750 applications, compared to a monthly average of 80. and captain david teets explained that the demand for concealed carry permits is surging in riverside county as well.\n\nan interview is part of the process for acquiring a concealed carry license in riverside, and teets explained that the number of applicants has pushed appointments for interviews from an average of eight to 10 months to as far out as 18 months.\n\nwriting in the daily press, supervisor lovingood made clear his belief that empowering the people to protect themselves is a good place to start in the fight against terrorism.\n\nawr hawkins is the second amendment columnist for breitbart news and political analyst for armed american radio. follow him on twitter: @awrhawkins. reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart.com.
a friday-published washington post opinion editorial — written by molly roberts and entitled what so wrong with motherf***er? — dismisses criticisms of rep. rashida tlaib's (d-mi) derision of president donald trump as a motherf****r, framing concerns of civility as manifestations of linguistic timidity.\n\nat a thursday evening moveon.org-hosted event in washington, dc, hours after her swearing-in ceremony as a congresswoman, tlaib said, we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker.\n\ndemocrat rashida tlaib during her first day as a u.s. congresswoman: we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker. pic.twitter.com/hg538zoqlb — kyle morris (@realkylemorris) january 4, 2019\n\nroberts praises tlaib — a self-described democratic socialist aligned with sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and rep. alexandria ocasio-crotez (d-ny) — for articulating a cogent case of the country in crisis via the trump administration.\n\n'motherf—er' is filler, writes roberts. it means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: it turns members of that gender into something to be played with. calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.\n\nroberts heralds the democrat party's most openly left-wing politicians, casting them as trailblazers pushing against an insufficiently left-wing party establishment. concerns over profanity, she argues, are secondary to championing those with the vision to break what must be broken in america towards ushering in transformational political change:\n\na better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. but the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. the liberal vanguard tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. they see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. the party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. and that, tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.\n\ndespite brushing off criticisms of tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in november, roberts called for amplified political censorship across facebook and twitter. she encouraged social media companies to further flex their power to shut down disinformation and false news, terms she neglected to define.\n\nfollow robert kraychik on twitter.
tony blair claimed friday that brexit is already damaging britain's economy by hitting productivity – hours before new data revealed productivity growth has, in fact, hit a six-year high.\n\nthe former prime minister's claim was included in a 32-page document arguing brexit was harming the nhs, jobs, and living standards, likely designed to make the case for blocking brexit by pushing for a second referendum in 2019, as he suggested thursday.\n\nthe document quotes the office for budget responsibility (obr), who in november 2017 reduced its forecast for productivity growth by 0.5 per cent per annum.\n\nthe renewed weakness of productivity growth over the first half of 2017 will almost certainly have been exacerbated by the brexit vote, the tony blair institute for change quotes the obr as saying.\n\nhowever, following the brexit referendum, in november 2016, the obr was forced to admit they had been too gloomy about the uk economy after a brexit vote and their recent productivity forecast was criticised as the return of project fear.\n\nuk labour productivity now 1% above the peak achieved before the 2008 economic downturn https://t.co/r4bxn8brk3 — ons (@ons) january 5, 2018\n\n0.2% rise in uk total public service productivity between 2014 and 2015 delivers sixth successive year of improving productivity – the longest consecutive period of growth for which estimates are available https://t.co/9galshvqmk — ons (@ons) january 5, 2018\n\nthe critics were correct, as friday the office for national statistics (ons) revealed growth in labour productivity hit a six-year high in the third quarter of last year, rising 0.9 per cent, following modest falls over the first six months of 2016.\n\nlaunching his push for a second referendum on thursday, mr. blair also claimed that the brexit vote had created significant staff shortages in the nhs.\n\nhowever, investigations have found that while the number of european union (eu) nurses being registered by the nursing and midwifery council has fallen, the number of eu staffers in the nhs is still rising overall, and currently stands at an all-time high.\n\nfurthermore, as bbc presenter john humphrys pointed out, the fall in the numbers of new eu nurses being registered has not been attributed to brexit, but the introduction of new english-language tests for foreigners.

venezuela's socialist president nicolás maduro has ordered all government employees to come into work only on mondays and tuesdays, enraging parents who want their children to go to school and opposition members who have deemed the decree immoral.\n\nmaduro announced tuesday that government workers would be expected to come into work two days a week until further notice, a measure intended to reduce the nation's use of electricity. venezuela depends on hydroelectric power and is currently suffering a drought that has left its main dam barely operational. abc news notes that the measure affects an estimated three million workers on the government dole. they will be paid full weeks despite the measure. schools are explicitly included in the measure, leaving the nation's children without class for most of the week.\n\nmaduro previously decreed three-day weekends to reduce demand for electricity nationwide, a move that elicited severe criticism of maduro's laziness and the improvisational nature of his rule. he has, nonetheless, opted for a more extreme version of this plan, which also included requesting that women not use electric hair dryers until further notice. maduro has also followed in the footsteps of north korean dictator kim jong-un and established his own time zone, moving venezuelan clocks 30 minutes forward.\n\nexperts say none of these efforts will likely reduce the nation's energy consumption, least of those the time change. they are thinking of water and electricity conservation, but there are few families who will abide by recommendations for saving [energy], so really this will not be very effective, venezuelan professor wílliam fuenmayor told el nacional. fuenmayor noted that late dictator hugo chávez had tried to change time zones in an attempt to save electricity and failed.\n\nvenezuela has been suffering infrastructure problems for years under maduro, though the problem has been exacerbated recently. in february, an attempt to prevent the current drought situation resulted in millions of caracas residents being deprived of drinking water due to alleged maintenance.\n\noutside the capital, the situation was even worse, as officials began rationing the water supply similarly to how necessary goods are rationed in supermarkets. currently, venezuelans must wait up to six or seven hours on supermarket lines to buy essential goods like flour, vegetable oil, and milk. increasingly, these lines have become violent, with individuals physically beating each other for access to limited food resources. the electricity shortage will likely force supermarkets to be open for fewer hours, worsening wait times to pay for groceries.\n\nthe pro-democracy opposition in the national assembly, meanwhile, is issuing stern statements condemning maduro. here in the national assembly we work monday to friday. the decree [license] to vagrancy dictated by the regime will not paralyze us, the head of the assembly, henry ramos allup, tweeted tuesday.\n\nthat because of corruption and electricity mafias our children will not have class is the height of immorality, maria corina machado, a former legislator, ousted from her position violently by maduro's police, said in response to the decree. venezuela demands education and productive work. these people are like gangrene, she added. they want to destroy and paralyze everything.
sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) expressed frustration on friday that the democratic national committee (dnc) removed the donor requirements for upcoming debates — a move that opens the door for michael bloomberg (d) to participate.\n\nthe dnc is adjusting the requirements to qualify for upcoming debates, raising the polling threshold but ditching the donor requirements altogether. the move effectively opens the door for bloomberg, who has been rising in the polls but has been unable to participate in democrat debates due to the donor requirements and his decision to self-fund his campaign.\n\nwarren, who has blasted the billionaire on the campaign trail, was incensed.\n\nthe dnc didn't change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. they shouldn't change the rules to let a billionaire on, she said on friday.\n\nbillionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules—on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government, she added:\n\nthe dnc didn't change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. they shouldn't change the rules to let a billionaire on. billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules—on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government. — elizabeth warren (@ewarren) january 31, 2020\n\nsen. bernie sanders' (i-vt) campaign also voiced frustration with the new rules.\n\ndnc changing the rules to benefit a billionaire, sanders campaign manager faiz shakir, who once criticized bloomberg for not participating in the debates, said. i much prefer democrats being a grassroots party. and under bernie sanders, that's the way it will be:\n\ndnc changing the rules to benefit a billionaire. i much prefer democrats being a grassroots party. and under bernie sanders, that's the way it will be. https://t.co/d7cti7obvn — faiz (@fshakir) january 31, 2020\n\nrep. tulsi gabbard (d-hi) also responded to the dnc's sudden rule change:\n\nthe dnc has defended its decision to modify the rules, contending that the criteria are no longer needed due to the capture of grassroots support in real voting.\n\ndnc spokeswoman adrienne watson told politico, the donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations, and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren't.\n\nbloomberg has reportedly spent more than $200 million in the last quarter on his presidential bid:\n\nmichael bloomberg gave his campaign $200,114,049.18 this quarter, and accepted zero –$0.00– in donations. wow. https://t.co/rqhs9zs240 pic.twitter.com/c2vvrwhfmc — christopher bedford (@cbedforddc) january 31, 2020\n\na reuters/ipsos poll released this week showed bloomberg surpassing warren with 12 percent support.
harvard university has announced plans to remove the reference to puritans from the ivy league institution's alma mater song, claiming that the word is not inclusive.\n\naccording to a column in the crimson by the staff editorial board, the reference to puritans in the school's song was not a concern for members of the harvard community before the announcement that the change would be made.\n\nstudents do not engage with the alma mater on a regular basis. by contrast, other renamed or changed traditions involved phrases like house master (a change we opposed) which were used regularly. indeed, the line in question has not been a source of consternation among students. in our view, the proposed change merely serves as a token that will ultimately achieve little in the greater scope of issues that plague harvard college.\n\ndespite this, a task force working to make harvard more inclusive announced their decision to get rid of the reference to puritans in the alma mater song.\n\nwritten in 1836, the alma mater ends with the line, till the stock of the puritans die. the song was revised in 1998 to make the lyrics more gender-inclusive, but they left the final line as it was, the task force wrote in a statement. we think it's time for a change.\n\nin an email to the college fix, harvard government professor harvey mansfield expressed disappointment over the change, arguing that it only serves to wash away the history of the university. he added that it serves as a gross instance of political correctness.\n\nmansfield called harvard america's trendiest university, and said that the move is a surrender to groups who want to use the university to gain their own political ends and who do not understand or care for the search for truth regardless of party.\n\ntom ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for breitbart news. you can follow him on twitter @tciccotta or email him at tciccotta@breitbart.com

the trump administration is handling the coronavirus outbreak better than previous administrations addressed earlier emerging contagions, said dr. marc siegel, professor of medicine at new york university, fox news medical correspondent, and author of false alarm: the truth about the epidemic of fear.\n\nsiegel shared his analysis on siriusxm's breitbart news sunday with special guest host joel pollak.\n\ni've been handling these emerging contagions for about 20 years now, and i have to tell you, i've never seen one handled better, said siegel of president donald trump's approach to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nthe center for disease control (cdc) erred in its messaging with a doom and gloom comment framing the spread of coronavirus in the u.s. as inevitable without quantifying caveats, siegel stated.\n\nit's not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses, said dr. nancy messonnier, director of the cdc's immunization and respiratory disease division, on tuesday.\n\nlisten:\n\nsiegel praised the trump administration's personnel selection for its coronavirus task force, headed by vice president mike pence.\n\nthe task force are really top players, said siegel, noting the task force's inclusion dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of health's (nih) infectious disease. fauci is one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, he noted.\n\nsiegel noted the coronavirus task force's inclusion of cdc director dr. robert redfield, a virologist, and dr. nancy messonnier, an expert in vaccines.\n\nthey've been doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing, said siegel of the trump administration's measures towards protecting americans from the coronavirus. [they are] restricting travel, isolating patients who are sick and, trying to cut down on contact. it's a very hard thing to do when people are pouring in from all over the world.\n\nsiegel contrasted the coronavirus's mortality rate with those of sars, swine flu, and the flu.\n\nsars had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people, recalled siegel. swine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. so this is killing more than flu, but i want to make a couple of points that will reassure people.\n\nsiegel continued, one, at the beginning of an emerging contagion, it always appears more deadly than it actually is. the 1918 flu is an exception, but normally as time goes on, it's less deadly, and part of that is because you see more immunity appearing, and you also find a lot of milder cases — or even cases where people don't get sick at all. you find that as you start to test more people.\n\nundiagnosed and asymptomatic persons infected with coronavirus are not captured in data for quantifying mortality rates, explained siegel, mild cases that are being undiagnosed make [coronavirus] seem more deadly.\n\nthe coronavirus outbreak illustrates the need for america's economy to decouple from china, assessed siegel.\n\nwe're relying on china for 90 percent of our ingredients for pharmaceuticals, siegel remarked. that hopefully will change as a result of this because we're going to end up with tremendous shortages of basic drugs, including antibiotics and blood pressure medication if this continues much longer in wuhan.\n\nsiegel concluded, this is a wake-up call that we must make more of our pharmaceuticals here in the united states.\n\nasked about news media conduct regarding coronavirus, siegel said, they're certainly not helping because they're hyping, and the hyping leads to hysteria.\n\nbreitbart news sunday broadcasts live on siriusxm patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. eastern.\n\nfollow robert kraychik on twitter.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) is expected to reject an objection to the electoral college votes as both chambers gather to count the votes, fox news reported on wednesday.\n\naccording to the report, mcconnell is expected to rebuke the gop challenge to certify the electoral college results for president-elect joe biden on wednesday, per sources:\n\nmeanwhile, a source familiar with wednesday's vote told fox news mcconnell plans to be one of the first speakers to object to initial challenges by colleagues in his own party, driving home the importance of certifying the votes — which have been approved by all 50 states — and ensuring a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nmcconnell has remained relatively mum on the forthcoming objections from his colleagues, although he urged gop senators to refrain from objecting to the certification in mid-december, contending that it would not be in the best interest of everybody:\n\n🚨new on a senate r call just now, @senatemajldr, @royblunt & @senjohnthune all pleaded with senate rs to not object to the election results jan. 6. mcconnel: it's a terrible vote for the gop. they'd have to vote it down, which makes it seem like they are anti trump, he said — jake sherman (@jakesherman) december 15, 2020\n\nhowever, the kentucky republican reportedly told colleagues that he ultimately won't judge anybody for their decision in objecting to electoral votes, describing it as a very difficult decision.\n\n'i've voted twice on declarations of war.' and he said, 'this is right up there.' but … there's a lot of noise out there and i won't judge anybody for their decision,' sen. kevin cramer (r-nd) said, recounting the conversation.\n\nover a dozen gop senators have expressed their intention to object to the certification alongside roughly 140 house members — an action that will trigger debates in both chambers.\n\nall eyes are on vice president mike pence, who will preside over wednesday's joint session of congress.\n\nif vice president @mike_pence comes through for us, we will win the presidency, president trump said in a tweet early wednesday morning ahead of his appearance at d.c.'s million maga march.\n\nmany states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process not approved by their state legislatures (which it must be). mike can send it back! he continued.\n\nstates want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval, the president said in another tweet.\n\nall the vice president has to do, he added, is send them back to the states, and we win.\n\ndo it mike, this is a time for extreme courage! trump added:\n\nif vice president @mike_pence comes through for us, we will win the presidency. many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process not approved by their state legislatures (which it must be). mike can send it back! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 6, 2021\n\nstates want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. all mike pence has to do is send them back to the states, and we win. do it mike, this is a time for extreme courage! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 6, 2021\n\ntrump, via his campaign, also hit back at a tuesday new york times report claiming that pence told trump that he does not believe he has the power to block the certification of the election.\n\nthe new york times report regarding comments vice president pence supposedly made to me today is fake news, the statement read. he never said that. the vice president and i are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.\n\nthe statement added that the vice president has several options under the u.s. constitution.\n\nhe can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. he can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the house of representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation, it added.
tel aviv – a column in the london-based saudi daily al-sharq al-awsat argued that the arab spring failed because opposition parties were just as undemocratic and dictatorial as the tyrannical regimes they were fighting to replace.\n\ncolumnist uthman al-mirghani wrote that arab opposition parties across the political spectrum – liberal, rightist, and islamic – had distanced themselves so much from the people that arab populations are now yearning for a return to previous regimes.\n\nmaintaining that the arab spring failed to realize a single one of the goals professed by protesters, al-mirghani said the chaos, crises, and wars that have swept the middle east are due to the failure of opposition groups to provide viable alternative governments.\n\nthe writer slammed opposition groups as weak and internally divided, and for having an intense preoccupation with their own interests and dreams of power, thus distancing themselves from the people.\n\nmany of the opposition parties accusing the existing regimes of tyranny are in themselves undemocratic, wrote al-mirghani, adding that the parties' political ideologies don't change matters.\n\nthe leftist parties have, in the eyes of the people, become a model of the elitism that is sunk in developing theories, while the islamic parties have become a model of egocentrism and opportunism.\n\nhe gave egypt and sudan as examples of countries in which the ruling parties were replaced by islamists, such as the muslim brotherhood, which turned to tyranny and absolute rule.\n\neven countries like morocco and tunisia, the latter of which sparked the wave of protests across the arab world, have yet to fully realize a peaceful and democratic transfer of power.\n\nal-mirghani asserted that the disillusioned masses have abandoned hope in opposition parties, and are instead turning to the internet – what he calls the online party – to voice their distress.\n\nthe arab spring … was not a message just to the regimes, as some people think. its outcomes are an indictment of the arab oppositions, which seem, to this day, not to have gotten the message, he concludes.
washington — in a senate confirmation hearing on thursday, david friedman, president donald trump's nominee to be u.s. ambassador to israel, indicated that although a two-state solution calling for the creation of a palestinian state next to israel is the most ideal path toward peace, the option has failed to yield progress due largely to palestinian intransience.\n\nunder questioning by marco rubio (r-fl) during thursday's confirmation hearing held by the senate foreign relations committee, friedman emphasized his skepticism toward a two-state solution, suggesting that imposing the deal on israel would be bad for their security and bad for their future.\n\nfriedman agreed with rubio when the florida senator noted:\n\nyour position is not that you are opposed to this ideal outcome in which there would be two states, but that you recognize that at this moment given the circumstances that exist in the world today, and in that region, in particular, it is not likely to have that outcome. and hopefully, that will change. hopefully, the palestinians will have better leadership. hopefully, they'll be more prosperous. hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to grow their economy and their security. and maybe in 20 years, 15 years, five years, sooner rather than later, we all hope there will be the opportunity for this to occur, but right now those conditions are perhaps not in place. and the worst thing to try to do is go in there and impose on our most loyal and important ally in the region a deal that is bad for their security and bad for their future, is that an accurate characterization of your feelings with regards to the two-state solution?\n\ni think it is senator, responded friedman.\n\nhe acknowledged that the two-state option is the most ideal road to peace between israel and the palestinian authority.\n\ni think it's the most ideal, friedman told sen. chris coons (d-de). i think it's the path that's received the most thought and effort and consideration. obviously, it's been tried for a long, long time and we continue to wrestle with it. much smarter people than me have tried to make progress and have failed, but it still remains i believe the best possibility for peace in the region.\n\nwhen questioned by sen. ben cardin (d-md), the senate panel's ranking-member, trump's nominee noted:\n\nif the israelis and the palestinians were able, through direct negotiations, to achieve a two-state solution along parameters agreeable to them…i would be delighted to see peace come to this region where people have suffered on both sides for so long. i have expressed my skepticism about the two-state solution solely on the basis of what i have perceived as an unwillingness on the part of the palestinians to renounce terror and accept israel as a jewish state. i think that in my view is a foundational problem, but i think it can be remedied and i hope it is.\n\nfriedman told the lawmakers that he agreed with president trump's recent comments marking a departure from the hardline stance the u.s. has maintained until recently, in which the two-state solution was the only option on the table.\n\ni'm looking at a two-state [solution], and one-state [solution] and i like the one that both parties like. … i can live with either one, declared the u.s. president while standing next to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the white house.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt), who spent $1.2 million on private air travel in the final quarter of 2019, is outraged that president trump did not mention climate change during tuesday's state of the union address.\n\nin the year 2020, how can a president of the united states give a state of the union speech and not mention climate change? sanders asked following the conclusion of trump's address to the nation:\n\nin the year 2020, how can a president of the united states give a state of the union speech and not mention climate change? — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) february 5, 2020\n\nhe was not the only democrat outraged over the absence of climate change from tuesday's address.\n\nnot mentioned during #sotu: – the climate disaster\n\n– the families he separated\n\n– the muslim countries he banned\n\n– the white supremacists he praised\n\n– the healthcare coverage he took away\n\n– his tax scam for the rich — ilhan omar (@ilhanmn) february 5, 2020\n\ntrump's need to undo the obama legacy is devastating our climate and environment. regardless of what trump says, #climatechange is real. the us needs to rejoin the #parisagreement and take #climateactionnow. #sotu #trumplies — rep. barbara lee (@repbarbaralee) february 5, 2020\n\namong the many things @realdonaldtrump didn't mention last night, it's shameful the #sotu didn't address #climatechange. we must transition to a 100% clean and pollution-free economy as quickly as possible. #actonclimate #cleanfuture https://t.co/ewem5euhwq — rep. blunt rochester (@replbr) february 5, 2020\n\nthe number of times trump mentioned the following in the #sotu the middle class: 0 climate change: 0 medicaid: 0 student debt: 0 preventing school shootings: 0 plan for dreamers: 0 — young democrats of america (@youngdems) february 5, 2020\n\nsanders is a huge proponent of the green new deal and has proposed a massive $16 trillion plan as a hallmark of his presidential platform, describing climate change as the single greatest challenge facing our country.\n\nhowever, sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. federal election commission (fec) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on apollo jets, llc, which the free beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.\n\nformer vice president joe biden (d) also spent over $1 million on private air travel, followed by sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma), who spent $720,518 in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nshe was spotted hopping off a private jet in des moines, iowa, this week and, as the video shows, appears to strategically place herself behind a staffer out of the camera's view:
a california elementary school has changed the name of its father-daughter dance to the family dance to be more inclusive.\n\nparent teacher association president patrick kuske, whose organization sponsors the father-daughter dance at sacramento's crocker/riverside elementary school, bowed to pressure to change the name of the dance after being told by a couple of parents that they don't like it.\n\nwe got a request from a couple parents to be more inclusive and change the name, kuske told fox 40.\n\nschool principal daniel mccord agreed with the change. however the child wants to define their family, whoever they want to bring with them they're able to do that, mccord said.\n\nthe principal also said that there were no complaints from parents after the name change was announced.\n\nkuske noted that the pta uses the dances as a fundraiser, so excluding people by the theme of the dance was questioned by some.\n\nstill, the pta chief said it isn't all about money. it's not just about making money for the school, it's about having a good time and getting people together at the same time, kuske exclaimed.\n\nthe sacramento city unified school district has also announced it will take this incident as an excuse to review all gender-related activities and issues at the next school board meeting on april 17.\n\ntraditionally, father-daughter dances were created to be inclusive, not exclusive. prior to such events, fathers often felt excluded from their daughters' school activities because most activities were aimed at mothers and daughters. while fathers and sons were typically involved in sports and similar activities, there were few school events for a father to do with his daughter. the father-daughter dance was created to give fathers an event where they could participate in their little girls' school activities.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
uk prime minister boris johnson says he is becoming 'more and more obsessed' with cop26 (the united nations climate conference which britain is hosting later this year).\n\n'the green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense,' he claims. 'if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.'\n\nthe green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense… if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs looking ahead to cop26, boris johnson says he is becoming more and more obsessed with what we can dohttps://t.co/egiunu4srs pic.twitter.com/83cbylzvma — bbc politics (@bbcpolitics) january 13, 2021\n\npossibly this is good news for johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend carrie symonds (aka princess nut nut). but it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.\n\na recent analysis by a senior economist at deutsche bank, for example, says that the way the european union is selling its 'green deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.\n\nin the report, titled climate neutrality: are we ready for an honest discussion?, eric heymann warns that the eu's green ambitions of 'net zero' carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.\n\nat the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'\n\nif we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. the only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.\n\nheymann warns:\n\ni know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. but we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.\n\nthis, heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\n\nlet's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, johnson.\n\nprosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\n\nthis makes a nonsense of johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. of course it won't. there is plenty of evidence to support heymann's claim. none to support johnson's.\n\ni pointed this out in june last year in a piece titled britain unleashes a green new deal to kill what's left of the economy.\n\nfor example, a study by economics professor dr gabriel calzada alvarez of madrid's university of rey juan carlos found that for every 'green job' created by the spanish government, another 2.2 jobs were destroyed in the real economy. another study, this time in the uk, found that for every green job created by government 'investment' in the renewables industry, 3.7 jobs were destroyed in the real economy.\n\nmore recently, a report by the think tank onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'red wall' seats (i.e. traditional labour constituencies in the midlands and north which lent their votes to the conservatives in the 2019 election so that johnson could deliver brexit) face being wiped out in johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.\n\nthis might suit johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the westminster bubble, but as paul homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.\n\nthe climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in london, where few jobs will be at risk. outside of london there is little support for net zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.\n\nboris johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.\n\nhere, for example, is market strategist and investor bill 'i absolutely believe climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces' blain writing at capx.\n\nthe brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. they break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. for all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.\n\n[it goes, almost without saying, that 'offshore wind' will be playing a major part in boris johnson's green revolution – the one that will supposedly create those 'hundreds of thousands of jobs']\n\nblain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.\n\nthis will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. the not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. i am no stranger to investment madness – three times i've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.\n\nboris johnson's obsession with green issues is steering the uk economy to disaster. he needs to go now.
theresa may's health secretary has snubbed christian campaigners and backed the use of sex-change drugs for children under the age of 18.\n\nthe department of health and social care, led by jeremy hunt mp, said that young people have a right to determine what happens to their own bodies, including consenting to drug treatments that can sterilise them and stunt growth.\n\nit comes as the government considers a 2016 parliamentary report demanding trans issues are mandatory on school curriculums, 16-year-olds can change their gender without parental consent, and calling for fast-tracked sex changes.\n\nhunt's department was responding to a petition by the christian group voice for justice uk, signed by more than 8,000 people, which called for all surgical and hormonal sex-change treatment to be banned below the age of 18.\n\nthe group referenced recent reports revealing the number of people regretting and seeking to reverse sex-change procedures is sharply rising, and criticised the fact children as young as four are being encouraged to embrace transgender ideology in school – something first exposed by breitbart in 2015.\n\nthe inevitable result is that increasing numbers of children are seeing themselves as having been born in 'the wrong body' and are demanding treatment, the petition, addressed directly to jeremy hunt, says.\n\nwere going for the 10,000 mark today. please sign our latest stand. https://t.co/jpu2p4bdmi — voice for justice uk (@vfjuk) january 22, 2018\n\nwhile some children may genuinely suffer from gender dysphoria, they add, it is medically well documented that expression of such feelings are frequently both normal and transient, and without intervention naturally dissipate over time.\n\nindeed, studies have found that 70 to 80 per cent of children who feel transgender lose such feelings, and another concluded that such feelings are much more likely to persist when adults in authority, such as teachers, tell kids they could be in the wrong body.\n\nthis government response is uninformed: puberty blockers may be given at age 10. if a child progresses to cross-sex hormones at 16 (as over 90% do) they are sterilised. is this in a child's best interests? @dhscgovuk @jeremy_hunt https://t.co/zp7nmux8jp — transgendertrend (@transgendertrd) february 20, 2018\n\nhowever, hunt's department wrote that if children have the capacity to give consent for themselves, then consent should be sought direct from them.\n\na person under 16 can consent to a sex change procedure if they have 'sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed', they claim.\n\nfurthermore, controversial sex-change drugs can be prescribed generally once the patient is around 15 years old for hormone blockers and 16 years old for cross-sex hormones.\n\nthe petitioners had concluded their appeal by asking: if a young person cannot legally buy a glass of beer below the age of 18, how is it we encourage them to make life-changing decisions involving the surgical mutilation of an otherwise healthy body, lifelong infertility, and with a lifetime spent on sex change hormones carrying well documented health risks and shortening life expectancy?
the wuhan coronavirus epidemic in iran is so severe that even the tightly controlled iranian press is beginning to question the government's absurdly low official statistics for the number of infections and fatalities.\n\nthe bbc noticed a striking example on monday, a headline that literally questioned the statistics coming from the regime.\n\nhere's an example of the first seeds of doubt in the iranian press over official coronavirus stats.\n\nheadline from financial daily eqtesad-e saramad: statistics: that is the question! pic.twitter.com/adu3vaqcyk — bbc monitoring (@bbcmonitoring) march 11, 2020\n\nan iranian state television host fell on his knees tuesday and begged his audience in the province of yazd to stay at home so they do not contract the virus. officials in yazd declared an emergency situation on sunday.\n\nthis is quite a change from the attitude taken by state media just a few weeks ago, when the coronavirus was dismissed as less dangerous than the flu, quarantines were derided as an unnecessary overreaction, and criticism of the central government's response was treated as seditious.\n\nin late january, iran was actually marketing itself as a perfect getaway destination for chinese travelers who wanted to celebrate lunar new year away from their own troubled country. iranian doctors thought a five-day quarantine would be sufficient for any visitors who displayed symptoms of the virus.\n\nwhile iranian media grows slowly more critical of the secular government, the iranian people seem to have lost a good deal of reverence for the theocracy during the coronavirus crisis.\n\niran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, is still trying to downplay the threat of the virus. religious shrines and ceremonies played an indisputable role in helping the epidemic spread so quickly, made worse by religious leaders who touted the healing properties of the shrines.\n\nanother ayatollah named abbas tabrizian, hailed by his followers as the father of islamic medicine in iran, became a figure of both local and international mockery for claiming the coronavirus can be held at bay by rubbing a cotton ball dipped in violet oil across the anus. an iran-based religious scholar with over a million followers named hadi al-modarresi who raised a stir by claiming the virus was undoubtedly an act of allah that is divine punishment against the chinese for their treatment, mockery, and disrespect towards muslims and islam admitted on wednesday that he himself has contracted the disease.\n\niranian social media is buzzing with undercover videos of overflowing morgues, images that paint a picture of a crisis much worse than the officially reported 9,000 infections and 354 deaths.\n\nthe situation is very difficult; the authorities do not provide the exact figures of the dead. they have even arrested a staff member who shot film inside a hospital, where you could see it was filled with dead people inside a cellar. and the situation is much worse now. hospitals are at capacity. no one is reporting the real death toll, a young iranian professional told fox news on tuesday.
the taliban wants to change the venue of scheduled peace talks with the united states this month from saudi arabia to qatar over riyadh's push to include the afghan government in the negotiations, members of the taliban declared on sunday.\n\nreuters reports:\n\nthe upcoming negotiations, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in afghanistan, are scheduled between the leaders of the taliban and us special envoy zalmay khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019. leaders of the hardline islamic militant group have rejected the kabul government's offer for direct talks, despite growing international pressure in favor of the western-backed afghan government having a seat at the table.\n\nqatar, home to the taliban's political headquarters, has long hosted and legitimized political leaders from the terrorist organization.\n\nwe were supposed to meet us officials in riyadh next week and continue our peace process that remained incomplete in abu dhabi last month, a senior taliban jihadi based in afghanistan told reuters on condition of anonymity, adding, the problem is that leaders of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae) wanted us to definitely meet the afghan government delegation, which we cannot afford to do now, and we have canceled the meeting in saudi arabia.\n\nsaudi arabia, pakistan, and the uae are the only countries that officially recognized the terrorist group's regime during its five years of oppressive rule in afghanistan and are believed to have significant influence over the group.\n\nanother unnamed senior taliban insurgent indicated that the narco-jihadis explained to saudi arabia that it was not possible for the group to meet kabul at this stage.\n\neveryone is aware of the fact that the afghan government wanted the u.s. and its allies not to leave afghanistan and we have paid a heavy price to expel all foreign forces from our country, he told reuters. why should we talk to the afghan government?\n\nzabihullah mujahid, a spokesman for the taliban, reportedly confirmed that the group had canceled the meeting in saudi arabia but did not reveal the location of the new venue.\n\nthe u.s. has not commented on the change of peace talks venue.\n\nmujahid recently told voice of america (voa) its negotiations with the united states for ending the war and illegitimate occupation of afghanistan remain on track.\n\nthere has been no interruption in the dialogue process with america because ending the occupation of afghanistan is now a compulsion for them [u.s.], mujahid told voa.\n\nin the wake of reports that the u.s. is considering withdrawing half of the estimated 14,000 troops deployed to afghanistan, american vice president mike pence recently told fox news that the commander-in-chief is in the process of evaluating pulling some service members from the war-ravaged country.\n\nthe white house had previously dismissed news reports of a u.s. troop withdrawal from afghanistan.\n\non social media, mujahid reportedly appeared optimistic about the series of u.s.-taliban negotiations in recent months.\n\nwe can say with certainty that they indeed proved effective. they have given birth to hope that should the negotiations continue with such speed, then it is possible that foreign aggression be brought to an end, following which peace will be established, the taliban spokesman declared.\n\nhe defended the narco-terrorist group's stance for not holding talks with the afghan government, dismissing kabul as the product of foreign occupation of afghanistan, with no authority or ability to end to the war.\n\nthe taliban is fighting to restore strict islamic law, or sharia, in afghanistan. trump administration officials have come out in support of a ceasefire and relegitimizing the taliban as an official political power. u.s. troops removed the taliban from power in afghanistan in late 2001.\n\nthe trump administration has made political reconciliation between kabul and the taliban the primary tenet of its strategy to end the war, which started in october 2001.\n\nin its latest assessment of the war, the pentagon said:\n\nthe united states has a single vital national interest in afghanistan: to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven from which terrorist groups can plan and execute attacks against the u.s. homeland, u.s. citizens, and our interests and allies abroad. our ultimate goal in afghanistan is a negotiated political settlement between the afghan government and the taliban.\n\nin recent months, the united states, via trump's afghan reconciliation envoy, zalmay khalilzad, has intensified efforts to bring the taliban to the negotiating table.\n\nmarking a major departure from previous administrations long sought by the taliban, the u.s. is negotiating directly with the group. khalilzad has met with the group on several occasions. the taliban generates most of its funding from trafficking heroin, some of which is partly fueling the unprecedented fatal drug overdose epidemic in the united states.\n\nthe u.s. has conceded that it will not see a military victory in afghanistan, home to the highest concentration of terrorist groups (20) in the world.
filmmaker luc besson blasted french presidential hopeful marine le pen in a scathing essay on saturday, calling the front national candidate a scammer and a perfect representative of the establishment she denounces.\n\nin a lengthy post on his facebook page, the 58-year-old director of leon the professional and the upcoming valerian urged his fellow countrymen to reject the populist, nationalist message of le pen, who came in second place behind centrist emmanuel macron in france's first-round presidential election this month and will face macron in a run-off in june.\n\nwe are the scammed, besson wrote. sentimental folks, yearning for ideals, strung along by fine words, tired of believing, revolted by unkept promises. weakened, disillusioned, an easy prey—like a wounded animal alone in the jungle.\n\nas for who is doing the scamming, besson lists two culprits: the le pen family and the front national.\n\nwhat a joke! the director exclaimed of le pen's claim to be the anti-establishment candidate and a candidate for the people.\n\nmarine is an heiress, raised in wealth and luxury in saint-cloud, a well-heeled suburb of paris, he wrote. she has never really worked in her life: neither in a company, nor in a factory, and definitely not on a farm. she has never contributed to france's growth, and has never created any jobs (except fake ones apparently). she is, in reality, the perfect representative of the establishment she denounces, living off handouts from brussels, and exploiting the system in every possible way to her advantage.\n\nhow can you claim to be the 'candidate of the people' without ever working for or with the people? and how can you declare your opposition to the 'system' while milking it for all it's worth for decades? he added.\n\nas for le pen's party, the front national, besson calls it a nice little business, whose upper echelons comprise the elite of french fascism.\n\nwhen and where in history has turning in on oneself had positive results? never, the director wrote. withdrawal brings isolation. isolation leads to totalitarianism. totalitarianism spawns fascism. fascism results in war. five thousand years of history are there as proof, and the little saint-cloud heiress cannot change history.\n\nbesson closed his essay with a call for french citizens to reject le pen and embrace diversity, which he called an opportunity and a strength.\n\nlet's look after our country, let's open up, let's transcend ourselves, and let's show the snake oil sellers that they have no place among us, he urged. let's show the rest of the world what it really means to be french. we are an open, courageous and fraternal people that has no need of two-bit ideology to get by. a great people grows even greater by supporting and reaching out to others.\n\nread besson's full essay here.\n\nfollow daniel nussbaum on twitter: @dznussbaum
prime minister theresa may has said she is confident of the success of british strikes on syria overnight, as well as defending the attacks as the right and legal thing to do.\n\nspeaking to the press from downing street on saturday morning, she described the joint action with the u.s. and france as limited, targeted and effective and insisted the aim was not to bring about regime change.\n\nrather, the syria strikes, committed to without a parliamentary vote, are intended to show that the international community will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, she claimed.\n\nthe prime minister @theresa_may is holding a press conference on syria. https://t.co/mwchyprfb5 — uk prime minister (@10downingstreet) april 14, 2018\n\nquestioning on if it was right to back strikes without giving the legislature a say, as recent prime ministers have done, mrs. may said she would be addressing parliament on monday.\n\nthere is no graver decision for a prime minister than to commit our forces to combat and this is the first time i have had to do so, she said. as always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.\n\nwe would have preferred an alternative path but on this occasion there was none. we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised, either in syria, on the streets of the uk or elsewhere.\n\nwe must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used. this action is absolutely in britain's national interest.\n\nthe lesson of history is when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat we must take a stand and defend them. that is what our country has always done and that is what we will continue to do.\n\nthe british government published their legal justification for the strikes on saturday, stating that in the course of fightign the syrian civil war the syrian regime has been killing its own people for seven years and that it had used chemical weapons in breach of the customary international law prohibition on the use of chemical weapons, and amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity.\n\nmaking the case for military action, the document further stated: the uk is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering… there is convincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief.\n\ndespite the document issued by the british government, jeremy corbyn, the leader of the opposition, called the strikes legally questionable and claimed mrs. may was taking instructions from washington.\n\nhe said: bombs won't save lives or bring about peace.\n\nbombs won't save lives or bring about peace. my statement responding to air strikes on syria: https://t.co/r6yqkk4mv3 — jeremy corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) april 14, 2018\n\ncontinuing: this legally questionable action risks escalating further, as us defence secretary james mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more likely.\n\nthe strike comes after concern from senior political figures in nato allies france and germany, where the interior ministers of both nations expressed the view that western strikes against the syrian government could spark a new migrant crisis, and a wave of migrants arriving in europe.\n\ngerman homeland minister horst seehofer, the leader of germany's anti-mass migration christian social union remarked on the link between western military action adn the arrival of migrants, saying thursday: we both would like the conflicts to be solved diplomatically and through dialogue. a continuation of this spiral (of violence) would amplify the problem of migration.
the california insurance commissioner says young girls who claim to be uncomfortable with their biological sex must be provided with coverage for elective double mastectomies to cope with their gender dysphoria.\n\ninsurance commissioner ricardo lara asked the california department of insurance to issue a notice stating young girls cannot be denied coverage for elective double mastectomies on the basis of their age, the post millennial reported sunday:\n\ncalifornia to facilitate mastectomies for young girls in the name of progresshttps://t.co/rjiante6r5 — libby emmons (@libbyemmons) january 3, 2021\n\nfor far too long, individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria have had to battle a host of challenges to get access to gender-affirming care in order to be their true selves, lara stated in a press release, adding:\n\nsocial stigma, misconceptions about gender dysphoria and its treatment, and outdated medical criteria create barriers to necessary medical care that can lead to tragic results for individuals with gender dysphoria, especially for our transgender youth.\n\naccording to the press release, lara's office has received complaints via san diego's transfamily support services that young people with gender dysphoria and their parents reported insurance companies were denying coverage for elective double mastectomies and other radical transgender surgeries for people under the age of 18.\n\nlara's office apparently considers the suggestion that a young girl and her parents take more time to consider such drastic bodily alterations as needlessly delaying the surgery.\n\nto be proactive, health insurance companies should evaluate their coverage criteria for gender dysphoria treatment and eliminate any noncompliant practices to avoid needlessly delaying and interfering with medical care recommended by a patient's doctor, the press statement said.\n\nkathie moehlig, executive director of transfamily support services, said in the statement the group is proud to partner with the california department of insurance to remove the age barrier for gender-affirming care.\n\nmoehlig continued:\n\nthis barrier was discriminatory and detrimental to the lives of trans youth, to have to navigate the overwhelming barriers to health care should not be a part of their experience. transgender youth already face so many challenges from unsupportive families, bullying at school, social stigmas, and even violence.\n\nadditionally, dr. ward carpenter, co-director of health services at the los angeles lgbt center, said california is now putting insurance companies on notice that they cannot deny access to medically-necessary care based on outdated rules that are not supported by evidence or scientific consensus.\n\ncarpenter said by issuing the legal notice to insurance companies, the state is expanding access to health care and also taking an important step in saving the lives of transgender and non-binary (tgnb) adolescents struggling with gender dysphoria, depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\ngeorgia bill would make child transgender surgeries, drugs illegal https://t.co/vlinzwctbs — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) march 8, 2020\n\nin september, california gov. gavin newsom (d) signed legislation that establishes a transgender wellness and equity fund that may be used for transgender medical interventions, many of which are known to cause sterility in children.\n\nfeminist group women's liberation front (wolf) opposed the legislation:\n\ngov. @gavinnewsom also signed ab2218, and the state of california will pay to sterilize children on the basis of claims to gender identity. https://t.co/brvisganye — wolf (@womenslibfront) september 28, 2020\n\nthe statement from lara's office also cites recommendations from the world professional association for transgender health (wpath), referring to the group as an international professional association that provides evidence-based standards of care for transgender people.\n\nthe department of insurance continued that wpath states male chest reconstruction surgery to treat gender dysphoria could be carried out in individuals under 18 'depending on an adolescent's specific clinical situation and goals for gender identity expression.'\n\nwpath, however, is an organization whose reputation has been called into question by an increasing number of medical experts and analysts because it receives funding from transgender industry and advocacy groups.\n\natlanta-based pediatric endocrinologist dr. quentin van meter explained to breitbart news during an interview in 2018 that wpath was launched by psychologist john money and sexologist alfred kinsey, who was a colleague of harry benjamin, to push a political agenda for gender ideology. wpath's original title was the harry benjamin international gender dysphoria association (hbigda).\n\nthis is not a scientifically based organization, van meter said. it's essentially a pseudo-professional group of people who are pushing an agenda and have been since the beginning.\n\nto be a member in wpath, you only need to have an interest in transgender issues, he explained. there is no professional degree required, no training specifically, no certification. if you want to be a member, all you need to do is pay your dues.\n\nwpath's website includes a page devoted to scholarship funds that names some of the organization's sponsors who work on both a national and global scope to magnify our efforts in a proactive way.\n\nthe association states its focus is on collaborations in three areas:\n\ngeneral rights – partners such as the southern poverty law center, united nations development programs and the world health organization\n\nsexual orientation and gender identity- partners such as the human rights campaign and the international lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex association (ilga)\n\ntrans* specific – partner such as the national center for transgender equality, transgender europe (tgeu) and global action for trans* equality (gate)\n\nin november 2019, breitbart news reported that crowdfunding site gofundme showed that more than 26,000 girls and women were seeking financial assistance to have elective double mastectomies, or top surgery, in order to appear more masculine.\n\npresident donald trump's deputies have restored the biology-based definition of sexual discrimination in federal healthcare rules, ending the novel transgender definition, which was inserted by obama. https://t.co/s8l9l8k37g — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) june 13, 2020\n\ndespite the focus on surgery to change one's appearance in order to look more like the opposite sex, there is no scientific evidence that transgender treatments such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries, actually benefit young people with gender dysphoria, mainly because gender identity is a psychological — and not a biological — phenomenon.\n\nin july 2019, attorney and writer jane robbins observed at the witherspoon institute's public discourse:\n\nthe concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. an individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. and as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. but the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania.\n\nthe man who became the first person to obtain a legal sex designation of non-binary now says the transgender lifestyle is a fraud. https://t.co/mem5ncstrw — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) january 8, 2020\n\nthe lucrative transgender industry is now enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. the cost of double elective mastectomy, for example, is over $10,000.
a gay man and attorney who worked on high-profile lgbt cases, including a challenge the boy scouts ban on homosexual members, set himself on fire on saturday at a public park in new york city to protest fossil fuels and climate change, according to a suicide note.\n\nthe charred remains of david buckel were found by a jogger in brooklyn's prospect park.\n\nthe daily mail reported:\n\ndavid buckel, 60, was found in the park at 6.30 a.m. on saturday before hundreds descended on it to enjoy the warm spring weather. he left a note in a bag for police which read: 'my name is david buckel and i just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide. i apologize to you for the mess, the note said.\n\nhe was protesting over climate change, his note read, and the dramatic method was intended as a metaphor for how fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the mail reported.\n\nmy early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves, the new york daily news reported his suicide note said.\n\na lifetime of service may best be preserved by giving a life. … honorable purpose in life invites honorable purchase in death. 'this is not new, as many have chose [sic] to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see. here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and earth is heard.\n\nbuckel worked on cases for lamda legal, one of the largest lgbt advocacy and legal groups in the nation.\n\nthe news of david buckel's death is heartbreaking. this is a tremendous loss for our lambda legal family, but also for the entire movement for social justice. https://t.co/sl9xz2cytr — lambda legal (@lambdalegal) april 14, 2018\n\nfriends said that after he left the organization, mr. buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels, the new york times reported.\n\npollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water, and weather, buckel wrote in the email sent to the times. most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter
a uk independence party spokesman has called on west midlands police to clarify their position on prosecuting female genital mutilation cases, following a tweet by the force shedding doubt on a zero-tolerance approach.\n\njane collins mep, ukip's home affairs spokesman, said in a press release she was worried by a tweet put out by west midlands police (wmp) which seemed to suggest that prosecuting the perpetrators of female genital mutilation (fgm) was not a priority for the force as it was unlikely to benefit the child.\n\nin case they delete it, a screengrab of that astonishing tweet by @wmpolice saying they don't want to prosecute for mutilation #fgmletstalk pic.twitter.com/t28zxlp00x — english gardener (@richard_1942) february 26, 2017\n\na follow-up tweet by detective gill squires, fgm expert for wmp, intending to clarify the force's stance merely further confused the issue by suggesting that the force will only prosecute if it is in the child's best interests to do so.\n\n@wmpsentinel @wmpolice how could it ever not be in the child's interests? — orwellian disciple (@astlesleftfoot1) february 26, 2017\n\ncollins said: it is in the best interests of everyone that this child abuse is eradicated. i cannot envisage a situation where the mutilation of a young girl which causes physical and psychological trauma, would result in a decision not to prosecute.\n\nit is only by prosecuting – and i agree with the commons home affairs select committee that it is a 'national scandal' there has yet to be a successful prosecution in the uk since 1985 when it was made illegal – that people will realise we will not live in a country with more than one set of laws.\n\nwmp later deleted the original tweet, replacing it with a link to a 2015 article which they said would help explain the issue.\n\nthe article explains that fgm has been a specific offence since the mid-80s, while further legislation introduced in 2015 allowed for parents to be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut.\n\nit goes on to quote dc squires as saying, we're still trying to fully understand the prevalence of fgm in the west midlands but as a force we're much better now at identifying potential victims – and with teachers, healthcare professionals and social workers more switched on to the signs we are seeing an increase in reporting. […] when a child is born to a woman who's undergone fgm, steps are in place to stress to the family the practice is illegal.\n\ndetailing how the force planned to use posters in hard-to-reach communities to tackle the practice, she added: the poster has been developed with community members and support groups and will be placed in schools and prominent locations…it's a 'softer' approach to try and work alongside communities to change attitudes about the illegal practice.\n\nfgm is not endorsed by any religion but supposed religious reasons are often used to justify the practice #fgmletstalk pic.twitter.com/k54sqhrwf2 — west midlands police (@wmpolice) february 24, 2017\n\nbut collins called for a tough approach to the issue, saying: i don't care if people say it's cultural – it is sick, wrong and illegal and must be enforced with stronger sanctions.\n\nthat is why this kind of message put out in the tweet from wmp worries me.

the german interior minister has said migrants will be denied permanent residence if they refuse to fit in to german society.\n\nkey chancellor angela merkel ally thomas de maizière, minister for the interior since 2013 heralded a slight change of course for the government today, and accepted his announcement could even unsettle some in germany.\n\nalthough germany has remained steadfastly pro-migrant through the crisis, despite being the focus of much social upheaval and enormous costs, germans are growing more wary of multiculturalism and there is some desire for newcomers to attempt to fit in. playing to that, mr. de maizière said yesterday there has to be a connection between the successful completion of integration and how long you are permitted to stay in germany.\n\nto realise this aim, he announced the government would be introducing a new integration law next month, reports der tagesspiegel. any migrant who refuses to integrate into german society by refusing to take german language lessons or to look for a job will be deported under the new plan.\n\nspeaking on his motivation for changing the law, mr. de maizière said we do not want ghettoes.\n\nif mr. de maizière wants no ghettoes in germany, he will have his work cut out for him dismantling the ones already established over decades of mass migration. breitbart london has reported at length on europe's so-called no-go zones where police dare not tread, including those in germany which are dominated by migrant drug gangs.\n\none such report published just two days before the cologne new year's eve rape attacks described the situation in the same german state — north rhine-westphalia — as beyond the control of the police. one member of parliament from chancellor merkel's own party criticised the local police for having failed to tackle migrant criminality.\n\nhe warned that criminal parallel societies are seeking the upper hand or are solidifying existing positions, and the report stated officers often left these migrant controlled areas bruised and battered.
in a sit-down interview with anderson cooper for cbs's 60 minutes, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the green new deal.\n\n[p]eople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a preview clip of sunday's show while comparing herself to former presidents abraham lincoln and franklin d. roosevelt.\n\npartial transcript as follows:\n\nocasio-cortez: there's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.\n\ncooper: do you have a specific on the tax rate?\n\nocasio-cortez: you know, you look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, you know, let's say from 0 to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. but once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.\n\ncooper: what you are talking about, just big picture, is radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now.\n\nocasio-cortez: well, i think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation. franklin d. roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security. that's radical.\n\ncooper: do you call yourself a radical?\n\nocasio-cortez: yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
u.s. tech companies want to hire more skilled professionals, so the government should give green cards to foreigners who graduate from u.s. universities, says a report released tuesday by fwd.us, an advocacy group for mark zuckerberg and other wealthy west coast investors.\n\nthe report claims:\n\nthe tighter labor market means u.s. employers are struggling to fill critical jobs, limiting productivity and putting global leadership at risk. these labor shortages are especially pronounced in emerging industries like artificial intelligence (ai) that rely on science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) skills.\n\nthe most straightforward solution is to allow graduates with a u.s. degree and a job offer to start working and begin the green card process immediately, says the report, adding this would relieve pressure on the h-1b program and keep it more focused on truly temporary workers, while facilitating permanent residency for well-educated and highly-skilled individuals who have already lived in the u.s. for some time and can fill permanent roles.\n\nthe fwd.us report is just one part of a broader campaign by companies and investors to convince legislators that they must quickly pass a labor-supply bill in 2021. that short timeline would minimize legislators'opportunity to debate the value of flooding the labor market for college graduates. it would also minimize americans' ability to organize opposition to the fwd.us plan, which would likely cut middle-class wages and spike housing costs.\n\nthe lobbyist chatter about the need for more skilled workers is about the second term, said daniel horowitz, the editor of conservative review. voters who back president donald trump's america first agenda need to organize this year to defeat next year's push for cheap labor, he said, adding:\n\nthe president needs to hear from his base — now is precisely the time to stand up and not stand down out of fear of pressuring the president. … he wants to be pressured [because] it is very hard for the president to go in one direction when 100 percent of the pressure inside the administration is headed in the other direction. the mistake that trump supporters make is they wait until it is too late to stop the president from feeling compelled to go with the swamp … the time to get to the president is early and often.\n\namerican graduates have to organize now to push back anticipated demands for more work visas by business roundtable and chamber of commerce types, said marie larson, a technology graduate and a founder of the american workers coalition. american graduates need a seat at the bargaining table because there is no greater stakeholder than american graduates — they are the ones whose livelihood is at stake.\n\nfwd.us was founded by wealthy investors, including facebook founder mark zuckerberg and microsoft founder bill gates, who also helped to expand the h-1b visa program.\n\nthe h-1b program lowers american wages by keeping roughly 700,000 indian and chinese graduate visa-workers in a wide variety of u.s. jobs.\n\noverall, roughly one million indian graduates hold american jobs because they are enrolled in the h-1b, opt, j-1, l-1, h4ead, and post-doc programs.\n\nthese one million-plus outsourcing workers have been used by ceos, university managers, and investors to stabilize their u.s. workforces and raise their stock-values — but at the cost of reducing many americans' opportunity to innovate and experiment.\n\ngovt data shows 1 million indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.\n\nthe indian hiring ignores many eeoc laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.\n\nit is a huge economic & career loss for us college grads.#s368 #h1b https://t.co/pqew9yj89c — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) february 17, 2020\n\nthis huge workforce also helps flatline salaries for american graduates. in 2019, for example, lower-skilled americans gained high wage increases amid reduced migration, but high-skilled americans got low salary increases amid the import indian workforce.\n\nthat's another lawless, moronic statement. and, who made the laws that allow foreigners to work lawfully? it rather seems the laws are illegal. the people of #alabama need to boot @repmobrooks. he's not for people. he's with corporate america's profits. — michael (@thejackofall) march 5, 2020\n\nthe fwd.us report also claims that immigrants are needed to fill 300,000 unfilled tech-jobs:\n\nstem fields have unemployment rates below the national average and more than 300,000 more jobs than there are workers to fill them, according to estimates from new american economy.\n\nmike bloomberg created the new american economy advocacy group. at a february 26 cnn town hall, bloomberg echoed the fwd.us plan by saying he would provide green-cards to every foreigner who graduates from a u.s. university:\n\none of the things in immigration is you've got to do some things quickly … you've got to staple a green card on every degree when they [foreign students] get out of college, particularly if they're studying stem [science, technology, enginering and math]… we need more immigrants, not less immigrants. and a lot of them come from china.\n\nanother founding member of the fwd.us group is former google chief eric schmidt.\n\nthe fwd.us report cites his february 27 op-ed in the new york times, which said the u.s. should counter competition from china by importing foreign scientists — such as chinese scientists.\n\nthe headline of the op-ed is: eric schmidt: i used to run google. silicon valley could lose to china, and it admits that schmidt and his peers are being out-competed by china:\n\n… in recent years, americans — silicon valley leaders included — have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure u.s. global leadership in new technology. now we are in a technology competition with china that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense — a reality i have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. the government needs to get back in the game in a serious way. important trends are not in our favor. america's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. a.i. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority. leading the world in a.i. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. a recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the united states is well ahead of china today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. china also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5g base stations as the united states. if current trends continue, china's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the united states within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.\n\nschmidt also admits that he and his peers have failed to attract, recruit, and train enough american innovators, saying, we should undertake major efforts to train up-and-coming scientists and engineers.\n\nthe failure to build up domestic skills has left schmidt and his peers dependent on the willingness of foreigners to work in u.s. firms, schmidt suggests:\n\na majority of computer scientists with graduate degrees working in america were born abroad, as were most current graduate students studying computer science in u.s. universities.\n\nbut schmidt argues that america's technological advantages can be preserved by continued reliance on these foreign experts:\n\nthey are a source of national strength. a vast majority want to stay and

people now to reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries — including to our strategic competitors.\n\nschmidt's reference to red tape,

lower wages to work in americans' jobs. there are no caps in the opt and h-1b programs, and lee's bill could roll back complicated country caps curbs on the award of green cards to foreign workers.\n\nso far, lee's s.368 bill has been blocked by several gop and democratic senators, by a few business interests, and by new groups of u.s. professionals. the high-stakes economic fight gets minimal coverage from white-collar journalists in the establishment media.\n\nbut fwd.us, the chamber of commerce, bloomberg's group, major universities, and other lobbies are expected to push for a quick passage of s.386 shortly after the election, say lobbyists from all sides of the fight.\n\nneither schmidt's op-ed nor the fwd.us report suggested that companies should expand the u.s. workforce by offering higher salaries and benefits to american graduates.\n\nthose benefits could include legal changes to end the large-scale indian outsourcing that has pushed many american experts out of

actor matt damon says he's sorry for the anger-inducing string of comments he's made of late, for which he was accused by many of downplaying the culture of sexual misconduct currently upending much of the entertainment world.\n\ni really wish i'd listened a lot more before i weighed in on this, damon said in an appearance tuesday on today i don't want to further anybody's pain with anything that i do or say. so for that i am really sorry.\n\nin december, the downsizing star received backlash after seemingly excusing sen. al franken's (d-mn) alleged serial sexual assault as a terrible joke and said he'd be able to work with louis ck after the comedian admitted to masturbating in front of several women.\n\nthose rolling stone interview comments were preceded by damon's admission to abc news that there's apparently a spectrum of behavior and that there's a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?\n\ndamon managed to enrage more people by insisting that the sh*tload of guys who aren't sexual predators aren't getting enough credit.\n\nnow, damon — whose acting career was launched into superstardom, with help from disgraced movie mogul harvey weinstein — says he's going to sit down and shut up and let the women leading the anti-harassment time's up movement do the work without him getting in the way.\n\na lot of those women are my dear friends and i love them and respect them and support what they're doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for the ride, but i should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while, he said on today.\n\nthe wave of misconduct allegations against powerful men in hollywood hit home with damon, who, in october, was accused of pressuring the new york times in 2004 to kill a story alleging sexual abuse against weinstein.\n\nlast month, a petition was launched demanding damon's cameo in the upcoming female-led heist reboot ocean's 8 be removed from the film. the petition, which says damon's role in the film is a show of massive disrespect for the brave women speaking out, has more than 28,000 signatures.\n\nfollow jerome hudson on twitter @jeromeehudson
apple ceo tim cook announced wednesday the tech giant will be combatting systemic racism and advancing racial equity nationwide with two new school projects launched under its racial equity and justice initiative (reji) project.\n\napple has committed $100 million to its reji project to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color, the press release stated.\n\nthe company's efforts will include the propel center, a learning hub for historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) and an apple developer academy, which expects to support coding and tech education for students in detroit.\n\napple said its projects will help build the next generation of diverse leaders.\n\ncook said in a statement:\n\nwe are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of apple's enduring commitment. we're launching reji's latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.\n\nwe are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at apple, cook said.\n\napple announced the reji project following the protests, looting, and rioting that occurred in the united states following the deaths of george floyd, breonna taylor, and others.\n\nevery individual deserves equal access to opportunity regardless of skin color or zip code, said lisa jackson, apple vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives.\n\nshe added:\n\nfor too long, communities of color have faced gross injustices and institutional barriers to their pursuit of the american dream, and we are proud to lend our voices and resources to build new engines of opportunity that empower, inspire, and create meaningful change.\n\nthe propel center was designed by ed farm, an education social justice group that works primarily with birmingham city schools and adults in the greater birmingham area. its key partners are apple and alabama power.\n\ned farm says the propel center is a physical and virtual campus imagined and designed … to provide historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) with shared services to support their work of preparing leaders who improve our word [sic].\n\nthe propel center will help cultivate leadership and drive innovation in tech and beyond, acting as a springboard for change in communities across america, ed farm founder anthony oni said in a statement.\n\nthe mission of the propel center is to provide innovative curricula to hbcu's in order to train black students in leadership skills. included in the curricula will be artificial intelligence (ai), agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment arts, career preparation, and entrepreneurship.\n\napple says its experts will help develop the curricula and provide mentorship and learning support.\n\nthe apple developer academy in detroit, a joint effort with michigan state university, aims to empower young black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders, helping them cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing ios app economy, the press statement says.
during a monday appearance on fnc's fox & friends, house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-ca) weighed in on the recording of a phone call obtained by the washington post of president donald trump pressuring georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger (r) to recalculate the state's votes from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nmccarthy argued that the election was not conducted well. he suggested to prevent delayed results and to shore up the integrity of future elections, congress should debate how to conduct the elections because it will unite this nation.\n\nthe president has always been concerned about the integrity of the election, mccarthy said of the audio. and the president believes that there are things that happened in georgia, and he wants to see the accountability for it. but look, does anybody in america think the last election was done well?\n\nwhat has happened here in this last election because of covid — people just sending ballots out to anyone who is on the rolls. well, these rolls have not been cleaned up. and this isn't the first time this has happened, he added. when are we going to straighten out our elections, and when can we have a debate about the integrity of the elections? and if we really want to unite this nation, that's what the house should be doing — and the senate. this should never happen again in the future. we've watched it before. we have to change it, and we have to make sure that our elections are accountable, have integrity, and are safe.\n\nfollow trent baker on twitter @magnifitrent
the head of the democratic national committee and several voting rights groups are calling on states to mail ballots to all voters to keep remaining primaries running as the coronavirus pandemic is keeping millions of americans at home\n\nvoting rights groups and the head of the democratic national committee want the states with remaining primary elections to offer voting by mail as a way to ensure that voters can safely cast their ballots amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\na quick and easy fix? not always.\n\nfor states that don't already have vote-by-mail or that greatly restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. it also would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating systems. buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the signatures on them could cost millions. and that's not to mention deciding who pays for return postage — individual voters or taxpayers?\n\nso far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting in only two cases, both limited in scope: maryland postponed its primary but decided to hold next month's special congressional election by mail. and the democratic party in wyoming, which already was sending all its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its presidential caucus.\n\nas in wyoming, the democratic caucuses and primaries in alaska, hawaii and kansas were already to be held largely by mail this spring. so far, none of the five states that have postponed their primaries — georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland or ohio — have said they will mail ballots statewide.\n\na bill in louisiana seeking to expand vote-by-mail was introduced even before the state's primary was pushed back, but it hasn't received a legislative hearing and is opposed by the state's top elections official. pennsylvania lawmakers eased absentee ballot rules last year, and now democrats want to expand voting by mail. republicans, who control the statehouse, have generally resisted voting changes, and it's unclear if the virus crisis is enough to overcome concerns about the costs of greatly expanding vote-by-mail.\n\nopposition isn't unusual, typically because lawmakers or election officials believe it opens a pathway to voter fraud. the ability to receive a ballot in the mail is greatly restricted in 16 states.\n\nthose states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid reason to get one — and require they be requested for each election. of those, delaware and new york are phasing in no-excuse mail voting.\n\nthe hurdles to implementing voting by mail for all voters is why states might be better off taking only small steps at first, said charles stewart, a professor of political science at the massachusetts institute of technology. that could mean simply making absentee ballots easier to get.\n\nhastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up causing all types of problems that you didn't anticipate, he said.\n\ndoug jones, an election security expert at the university of iowa, said universal mail voting also raises concerns about voters illegally selling blank ballots or being coerced to vote a certain way.\n\non tuesday, after ohio postponed its primary and poll workers failed to show up at some florida and illinois precincts, democratic national committee chairman tom perez called a shift to voting largely by mail the simplest tool to balance health concerns and the need to carry out a fundamental function of democracy.\n\na half-dozen states already have or are implementing systems where all voters are mailed ballots. they can mail them back, drop them off at designated spots or choose to vote in person on election day.\n\noregon has been conducting elections that way since the 1990s. since then, california, colorado, hawaii, utah and washington have implemented or begun phasing in similar systems.\n\nwith the coronavirus pandemic, the idea has generated more interest. the national vote at home institute advocates for a switch to a mail-based voting system and consults with governments about it.\n\nsaid chief executive amber mcreynolds: it's better than hoping people show up and aren't scared, and hoping that you don't have a giant poll worker shortage and hoping polling places aren't closed.\n\n___\n\nmulvihill reported from cherry hill, new jersey.\n\n___\n\nassociated press writers frank bajak in boston; melinda deslatte in baton rouge, louisiana; and mark scolforo in harrisburg, pennsylvania, contributed to this report.

in his weekly angelus address sunday, pope francis commented on the meeting of jesus with an adulterous woman, observing that the woman is an image of all humanity, since we are all adulterers who have cheated on god's love.\n\nin his reflection on the sunday gospel reading, the pope recalled the episode where a group of pharisees drag a woman caught in adultery before jesus to see how he will react, reminding him that moses prescribed stoning for this sin and hoping to trap him in his response. rather than take a stand on her punishment, jesus suggests that the one with no sin on his own conscience be the first to throw a stone at her.\n\nthis woman represents all of us, since we are sinners, that is, adulterers before god, traitors of his faithfulness, francis said.\n\non this, the third anniversary of his pontificate, pope francis told the crowd of thousands gathered in saint peter's square that the story is one of his favorite passages in the bible, that he likes to read and reread often. it highlights the theme of the mercy of god, he said, who never wills the death of the sinner but that he be converted and live.\n\nfrancis noted that the pharisees weren't really looking for jesus' opinion on the mosaic teaching but rather were trying to ensnare him in a catch-22 situation. either jesus contradicts the law of moses by recommending leniency, thus alienating himself from his jewish followers, or he takes a hardline stance and recommends the stoning of the woman, thus betraying his own call to gentleness and mercy.\n\ninstead, francis notes, jesus escapes from their trap by suggesting that the one who is without sin cast the first stone, and they all leave one by one, beginning with the eldest.\n\nand so once all the pharisees have walked away, jesus turns to the woman and says, where are they? has no one condemned you?\n\nno one, sir, she replies.\n\nand jesus answers: neither do i condemn you. go, and sin no more.\n\nthough we only know of this woman by the title the adulteress, francis said, this label does not do justice to her, because jesus sees the person beyond her sin and desires her salvation.\n\nthe pope reminded his hearers that we should not identify ourselves or others by our inclinations toward sinful behavior, a tendency all too common in today's world.\n\ngod does not nail us to our sin, francis said, and he does not identify us with the evil we have done. we have a name, and god does not identify this name with the sin we have committed.\n\njesus makes the woman feel, perhaps for the first time, that she is not her sin, that she has a dignity of a person; that she can change her life and escape from her bondage and walk in a new way, he said. because every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\n\nwe would all do well, francis added, to have the courage to drop the stones we carry to throw at others, and think a bit on our own sins!\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
a significant 86 per cent of austrians surveyed in a snap poll on sunday night support their country continuing independent action to deal with the migrant crisis, without the guidance or agreement of the european union (eu).\n\naustria was on the main migratory corridor from the near east and north africa to europe, sitting at the top of the so called 'balkans route' until action by nations like hungary and macedonia closed access to the peninsula by illegal incursions.\n\ndespite having spent much of 2015 being highly critical of efforts to close the route, austria's government under chancellor werner faymann is now taking a much harder line, and this is proving extremely popular with voters, reports kronen zeitung.\n\na snap poll taken after a sunday night television appearance by the chancellor, in which he again called on his german counterpart angela merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country. with the statement austria should continue to set their own migrant policy as long as there is no solution at eu level, 86 per cent agreed, with 62 per cent agreeing strongly.\n\nalthough the question left the possibility of austria falling into line with the eu at a later date should a continent-wide approach to the migrant crisis be agreed on, to the respondents this seemed a remote possibility. some 83 per cent said they couldn't see any sort of agreement between the eu-28 in the next few weeks.\n\na similar proportion also believed austria should be unafraid to make decisions independently of the eu. asked is it right to enforce the balkan closure along with other states, 85 per cent agreed, with just six per cent disagreeing strongly.\n\nthe transformation of austria's chancellor faymann from a merkel-esque advocate of unlimited asylum for all comers into an advocate of border control and fences was as unexpected as it was sudden. austrian media now characterises him as a frenemy to the german chancellor, describing his conversion to plan b as an emancipation.\n\nexplaining this transformation, chancellor faymann has spoken of plan b as self defence for austria, and insisted austria could not become the waiting room of germany.\n\nhis reticence to play ball with the euro club of leaders in brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in brussels. as breitbart london reported, swedish leader stephen löfven slammed european countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.\n\ncalling for a pan-european solution and discouraging exactly the action austria, hungary, and others have taken, mr. löfven said:\n\nthe important thing now in such a difficult situation is that we do things together in the eu. if all keep on with their own unplanned solutions we'll make it even worse.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Authorities have banned demonstrations in a large section of central Athens and will shut down streets and subway stations during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who arrives in the Greek capital Thursday afternoon for meetings with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials.\n\nAround 2,000 officers, a police helicopter and drones will be deployed for the visit, which ends Friday afternoon.\n\nGermany was the largest single contributor to the three international bailout packages Greece received since 2010 as it struggled through a dramatic financial crisis which almost saw it crash out of the eurozone. Germany was also seen as one of the main enforcers of the stringent austerity measures, including tax hikes and pension and salary cuts, imposed in return for the loans.\n\nGermany Profited €100 Billion From Greek Debt Crisis http://t.co/g1xF4xR5mh pic.twitter.com/pHhd52HA1k — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 11, 2015
The House Democrats' proposed 2019 homeland security budget reopens the nation's southern border to migrant inflows, while it also dangles the promise of cheap labor in front of GOP legislators and donors.\n\nThe draft budget adds $1.75 billion in extra border spending to President Donald Trump's $58.7 billion budget request for the Department of Homeland security in 2019, according to a copy published by the Washington Post.\n\nBut Democrats' draft bill does not include any funding for the wall, and it uses the extra money to help migrants bypass border protections and then win jobs in the U.S. labor market.\n\nJudging by the draft bill, the Democrats want to limit the government's ability to keep people out of the country, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. In the Democrats' provisions become law, he said, adding that enforcement would be weakened and people abroad would every quickly learn of that, and then illegal immigration would dramatically increase, especially of people with children.\n\nAny flood of new migrants will force down wages for Americans, raise profits for donors, and will pressure some Americans to seek welfare from the government. In 2017, under rules set by former President Barack Obama and Congress, roughly 400,000 migrants got work permits to compete against Americans for jobs.\n\nThe Democrats' bill does not include any money for fences or walls, and it bars officials from setting barriers in major migrant pathways across the border:\n\n[The bill] prohibits the use of funds from this and prior year Acts to construct physical barriers, as follows: Within or north of the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge; Within or north of the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; Within or north of La Lomita Historical Park; Within, south of, or north of the National Butterfly Center; or Within, north of, or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe bill blocks Trump's rules which deny asylum to migrants who say they are afraid of gangs or domestic violence. It commits the DHS to end the detention of migrants who bring children to the border even though many migrants openly tell reporters that they bring children to trigger Obama's catch and release rules. The bill also cuts funding needed to keep migrants in detention until their legal claims are resolved, and it spends at least $75 million to encourage the catch-and-release of migrants.\n\nThe bill allocates $502 million for humanitarian concerns to welcome and aid migrants as they push their way through the border.\n\nIt also reopens Obama's pipeline for relaying Central American UAC youths from the cartels' coyotes at the border up to their parents and relatives who are living illegally in the United States while cutting ICE personnel levels and enforcement operations.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes the EB-5 law which allows wealthy Chinese and Indian families to effectively buy green cards if they lend cash to American real-estate developers. The citizenship-for-sale program has strong supporters in both parties, including from New York's Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and Texas' GOP Sen. John Cornyn.\n\nThe bill also diverts border security funds into pork-barrel spending in members' districts, such as the purchases of aircraft, extra construction projects, $403 million for disaster spending, and a requirement that federal agencies clean up debris from forest fires.\n\nThe Democrats' border-opening legislation comes after the GOP Hill leadership — and the White House's Hill liaison team — failed last winter to enact a DHS funding bill for 2019. During the entire year of 2018, the Senate's GOP leadership did not publicly use any carrots or sticks to win Democratic acceptance to a border security plan acceptable to President Donald Trump, who must now pressure Hill legislators to pass much of the 2018 border security bill which was not passed in 2018.\n\nBut Democrats do not want to recognize the economic and civic damage from their tacit support of mass migration, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nIt is becoming increasingly mainstream on the left to reject the concept of immigration controls. Not that criminals should be let in, or terrorists, but the principle [they support] that everyone has the right to move here — unless there is some specific reason to keep them out— is now at the center of the Democratic Party.\n\nOur elites are increasingly dangerous — they are a danger to the health of their society, he added.\n\nTrump's Hire American policy is pushing up wages. So the DC estb. is loudly negotiating itself towards a wage-cutting amnesty. Lots of Kabuki noise and jumping to ensure the media does not pay attention to the money. https://t.co/8vkEEOocfi — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 19, 2019\n\nDemocrats have plenty of tools to pressure GOP legislators to accept the Democrats' border-opening legislation.\n\nThe bill denies any funding for walls. When GOP legislators push for wall funding, Democrats can demand offsetting cutbacks in enforcement and border rules.\n\nDemocrats also can offer more cheap labor to GOP donors if the GOP legislators agree to the Democrats' border opening plans.\n\nFor example, the bill does not include several expansions of visa-worker programs which were included in the July 2018 draft budget by Rep. Kevin Yoder and many GOP and Democratic appropriators. Yoder was defeated in November, but the border security panel is dominated by House and Senate appropriators.\n\nYoder's provisions would have roughly doubled the inflow of H-2B seasonal laborers, so forcing down salaries for American seasonal workers and blue collar workers.\n\nYoder also pushed for a rule which would allow all farm companies — including dairies — to use the fast-growing H-2A agricultural worker program. If adopted, the measure would shrink farmers' incentives and ability to buy American made, labor-saving machines, such as robotic cow-milkers.\n\nMost dramatically, Yoder and his fellow appropriators offered the hugely valuable prize of green cards to at least 50,000 additional low-wage Indian and Chinese graduates per year if they take middle-class jobs from American graduates. The green card offer is being marketed by lobbyists as the fair removal of country caps. But it is being backed by U.S. Fortune 500 companies who wish to raise their stock values by hiring more cheap visa-workers in place of American graduates.\n\nU.S. companies already employ roughly 1.5 million college trained visa workers, mostly in jobs that were not advertised to American graduates. Many of those workers accept very low wages from their employers in the hope of winning green cards from the government.\n\nFeds use a fake university to bust college-grad labor traffickers who funneled at least 600 Indian grads into jobs around the US. The trafficking was hidden within the quasi-legal workforce of 1.5 million H-1B, OPT, L-1, TN, etc. white-collar visa-workers. https://t.co/EBenDh5wE3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 31, 2019\n\nThroughout the next several weeks, the GOP legislators will face pressure behind closed doors from business groups that want the cheap H-2A, H-2B, and H1B visa workers.\n\nYet few reporters ever ask legislators why they are eager to import cheap labor which forces down wages and salaries for Americans — including the wages and salaries paid to the journalists' children, friends, relatives, and college roommates.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up real estate prices in New York, California, and elsewhere, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The looming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Tuesday has the potential to open up global tourism and foreign investment to North Korea, with little prospect of any profits reaching the North Korean people.\n\nReports have suggested since the dialogue process began that Kim Jong-un has encouraged Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and President Trump to consider investing in lavish tourist resorts within his state.\n\nThe lush natural landscapes of North Korea – from Wonsan's beaches to the Pyongyang skyline to the terrific glory of Mount Paektu, an active volcano – lend themselves to inviting travel, particularly from China and other neighboring countries. Yet many remain skeptical that any investment enriching the Kim regime will help reduce the abject poverty the average North Korean suffers, and concerns abound that Pyongyang could use the money to strengthen its ironclad grip on religion, freedom of expression and any political dissent.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, dictator Kim Jong-un made his avid interest in attracting tourism to the country well known early in his tenure. In 2013, Kim debuted the massive Masikryong Ski Resort, which official North Korean propaganda described as a feat of the supreme will of the people despite widespread hunger and disease that rendered skiing far from a priority of the average North Korean. Two years later, Kim announced that he would launch a campaign to attract up to two million foreign tourists by 2020, when the most common kind of tourist to the country was an elder Chinese communist seeking to relive the glory days of the Maoist era.\n\nWhile more permissive in allowing Chinese tourists to enter the country, the Kim regime does allow Westerners to see it, but only through restrictive tour programs where a North Korean guide stays with each individual at all times, ensuring they do not ask incorrect questions or wander out of the sight of the government. Tour companies like Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours specialize in helping foreigners navigate the process of being allowed in, and organize itineraries once approved. They have not taken Americans since Congress passed a law banning American tourism to the country in 2017.\n\nThis interest in tourism has reportedly seeped into recent talks with China and the United States. This month, the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo reported that Kim has repeatedly mentioned to Chinese officials his desire to see Beijing invest in creating a world-class resort in Wonsan, a beachside city several reports suggest could be turned into a special economic zone where foreign investment is permitted. The same newspaper reported that Kim Yong-chol, believed to be Kim's most trusted official, suggested to President Trump that he could help North Korea build a casino in Wonsan, should talks with Kim go well, predicting that a casino in that city could generate $50 million a year.\n\nNorth Korea forced reporters covering the alleged shutdown of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site to stay in Wonsan and write about what a beautiful place it is, reports revealed after the event, and at least one outlet, China's Xinhua news service, complied.\n\nMainichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported this month that Kim may bring up the Wonsan project during his talks with Trump tomorrow.\n\nHarry J. Kazianis, the Director of Defense Studies at The Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korean affairs, tells Breitbart News that any talk of resorts, at least in my view, is years away.\n\nWhile it would seem, at least on the surface, that any investment in a nation such as North Korea — with an economy one-third the size of Ethiopia — would be uplifting, it will do nothing to help the average citizen, he says. Building such resorts, in the hope that they will attract international vacationers and adventure seekers — if sanctions are lifted — will only enrich a regime that has over 100,000 people in gulags on-par with Stalin or Hitler. Such a thought actually sickens my stomach.\n\nPreliminary reports from Wonsan appear to corroborate the claim that resort construction has hurt the local people. Radio Free Asia (RFA), which relies on local sources to report on events deep within the secretive communist state, reported in May that Pyongyang is largely funding the Wonsan reports on the backs of local North Koreans.\n\nTo meet the needs of construction, the regime has issued a 'mobilization order' and has imposed a new construction tax, UPI, quoting RFA, reported. Local-level North Korean cooperatives, organized by neighborhood across the country, have been asked to donate manpower and financial support for the construction of the marine tourism zone, according to the source.\n\nWork on the construction in Wonsan has been so crushing, RFA reported two weeks later, that the rapid and haphazard construction caused an electrical fire in a barracks housing at least 40 laborers. It's unclear how many people died in the fire, but there were reportedly a large number of casualties, a source in the country told the outlet. The source stated that laborers were only allowed three to four hours of sleep a day.\n\nMore and more, local residents who hear about the deaths of these workers are expressing their dissatisfaction with how the construction is being pushed along, the source said. And even though a seaside resort is being built, we'll never get to go there.\n\nNorth Korea operates under a caste system known as songbun, that offers families clout based on how loyal they have historically been to the Kims. High songbun families live in Pyongyang and receive job offers in the central government; lower songbun families are banned from the capital and forced to starve for generations in rural areas. The lowest songbun families – relatives of known political dissidents or defectors, individuals found possessing Hollywood movies or Bibles – are relegated to concentration camps. Up to 120,000 people are estimated to live in North Korea's camp system, many having been born there and knowing nothing else.\n\nCommunist regimes that lack a rigid caste system rarely let locals partake in tourist activities meant for foreigners. In Cuba, for example – arguably gifted with the most lucrative tourist sites in all of the communist world – local Cubans are forced to do business in a worthless parallel currency, the Cuban peso, that is not accepted in tourist areas. Tourists use the Cuban convertible peso, which is worth the equivalent of an American dollar.\n\nThose who have observed the abuses of the Castro regime believe there is no way North Korea would allow low- or medium-songbun families to enjoy the nation's tourist resorts.\n\nFirst of all, North Korea has no money. Neither does Cuba. The investment you're going to make in Cuba, just like North Korea, is going to be China spending money there or some other entity spending money, but North Korea has no money and neither does Cuba, Dr. Javier García-Bengochea, whose family owned one of Cuba's most lucrative ports in Santiago before Fidel Castro stole it during the Revolution, told Breitbart News. So you are going to be effectively … cannibalizing or appropriating their natural or cultural resources going in for whatever their minerals are or tourism there is. You're not going to build Cuban society, or North Korean society.\n\nMickael Behn, whose family are the rightful owners of Havana Docks company, agreed. [Tourism and investment] will supply the top end of the regime, the military, to keep it alive, while all the other average people won't see any of it and will be used for cheap labor.\n\nThat's what the population is for, cheap labor, he added. it's an exact parallel to Cuba in that context.\n\nIf the Singapore summit results in the U.S. government allowing private American investors to profit there, Behn says, the nation's largest corporations may profit even if placed at risk of suffering what his family did in Cuba. I can see American companies going there … but it's at their own risk. The larger companies, I'm sure they can take a risk, a chance and they'll profit most from it.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has clearly stated it has no intent to invest American taxpayers' dollars in North Korea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has hinted at the possibility of allowing Americans to invest there.\n\nThis will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid, he told Fox News Sunday. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. These basic economic advances could go a long way to help North Korea's tourism industry.\n\nPompeo later said it was important to Kim Jong-un that he receive economic help from America in the form of private sector business's knowledge and know-how.\n\nThe tour guide companies – smaller than the major cruise corporations investing in Cuba, for example – have expressed a willingness to serve Americans with North Korea tours if Trump repeals the current ban. On its website, Koryo Tours states, as and when this travel ban is lifted, we would be more than happy to take you [Americans] to the DPRK (North Korea), and share our experience and knowledge there with you.\n\nWe will notify our mailing list as soon as there are any changes to this U.S. travel ban, and our ability to take people travelling on American passports to the DPRK, it adds.\n\nYoung Pioneer Tours, which chose to stop taking Americans after the death of one of its customers, Otto Warmbier, confirmed with Breitbart News that should the official U.S. ban on travel to the DPRK lift for U.S. citizens and if the opportunity to help facilitate positive business and economic relationships between the DPRK and American companies arose we would be open to assisting with these endeavours.\n\nTrump will likely face North Korea's economic concerns in person in his meeting with Kim tomorrow. Reports indicate the American side will not discuss human rights during this first meeting, so any conversation on the possibility of promoting tourism in the country will address only half the problem.\n\nNo American companies have publicly expressed a desire to invest in North Korea, whether in infrastructure or projects like the Wonsan resort. Yet estimates suggest it will take at least $2 trillion to bring North Korea into the 21st century, and South Korea simply does not have that kind of investment money around. China may help – it is already offering classes in economics to North Korean officials – but a communist regime can only do so much to spur economic growth.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
President Trump's compromise legislation to reopen the federal government funds border security measures in Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Libya.\n\nThe legislation known as the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act by Trump and the Senate GOP Leadership includes American tax dollars funding border security in North Africa, and the southern and western regions of Asia.\n\nWhile $5.7 billion is designated to build bollard-style fencing at the U.S.-Mexico border, about $15 million is allocated to border security programs in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation grants nearly $6 billion to fund foreign militaries, which allows the Lebanese Armed Forces to use some of that funding to strengthen border security and secure Lebanon's borders.\n\nThe billions in U.S. taxpayer funding is also allocated to stabilize Libya, which includes increased border security for the country. The military of Egypt will continue to receive about $1.3 billion in taxpayer money that can likewise be used for border security efforts.\n\nIncluded in the compromise legislation is a plan to give amnesty in the form of three-year work permits to about a million illegal aliens and foreign nationals who would be shielded from deportation. The bill increases the number of low-skilled non-agricultural foreign workers that business is allowed to import every year instead of hiring Americans.\n\nThe Senate bill is expected to be voted on this week.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

President Donald Trump says ensuring legal immigrants prove they can be self-sufficient before permanently resettling in the United States is a critical Supreme Court victory for American taxpayers.\n\nDuring a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday evening, Trump touted this week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows the federal government to enforce the Clinton-era Public Charge rule, which seeks to end welfare-dependent legal immigration.\n\nI'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration, Trump said. We will now finally be able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer-funded programs.\n\nThe rule ensures legal immigrants will be less likely to secure a permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using subsidized healthcare services, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nPublic Charge: Self-Sufficient Immigrants Proficient in English Favored for Green Cardshttps://t.co/KeJI4XnNuC — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 12, 2019\n\nThe regulation will be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nThe National Academies of Science released a report two years ago noting that state and local American taxpayers are billed about $1,600 each year per immigrant to pay for their welfare, and immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households.\n\nA recent Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) study notes that about 63 percent of noncitizen households in the U.S. use at least one form of taxpayer-funded welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare. This means that noncitizen households use nearly twice as much welfare as native-born American households.\n\nThe most recent Harvard/Harris Poll finds that a 56-percent majority of Hispanic Americans support denying green cards to legal immigrants who have used welfare. About 60 percent of U.S. voters support ending welfare-dependent legal immigration — including 62 percent of swing voters.\n\nTrump also slammed Washington Democrats for betraying Americans on the issue of immigration, citing New Jersey's sanctuary policies that shield criminal illegal aliens from being deported:\n\nRight here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instated sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your communities. For example, Cumberland County … they released an illegal alien with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at-large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn't give him to ICE. [Emphasis added]\n\nNo American should ever be hurt, harmed, or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter criminals, Trump said.\n\nSince March 2019, New Jersey has been a sanctuary state for criminal illegal aliens. The statewide law bans local law enforcement from turning arrested illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nCurrently, there is an estimated record high of 44.5 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S. This is nearly quadruple the immigrant population in 2000. The vast majority of those arriving in the country every year are low-skilled legal immigrants who compete against working- and middle-class Americans for jobs.\n\nEvery year, about 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal aliens, according to an analysis by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). Of the roughly 150,000 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody, more than 40,000 are illegal aliens, indicating that more than 25 percent of the federal prison population came to the U.S. illegally.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

CLAIM: Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) says California had an incredible decade because it stood up for our values and took on big issues.\n\nVERDICT: Mostly false. California's economy recovered, but it lags behind in other areas.\n\nNewsom tweeted on New Year's Day: What an incredible decade. We've accomplished so much in CA by standing up for our values and taking on some of the biggest issues — from healthcare to gun violence to climate change.\n\nCuriously, Newsom did not cite the state's economic or fiscal progress, but its values. That is because much of what Newsom and the Democrats value in California has to do with good intentions, rather than real-world results.\n\nCalifornia's only achievement in health care is extending free benefits to illegal aliens. Despite gun control, it led the nation in mass slayings last year. And its effect on global climate is negligible, as its energy costs climb.\n\nWhen Breitbart News asked Newsom last month how he would defend his state against conservative criticism, he cited California's economic recovery, and noted that the state now runs a budget surplus, rather than a deficit.\n\nBut these trends, while commendable, are inseparable from the recovery of the nation as a whole. Though the state remains a hothouse for high-tech and media startups, thousands of companies left the state due to its high taxes, heavy regulations, and litigious environment.\n\nNewsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, once said: We've got a few problems, we have lots of little burdens and regulations and taxes … But smart people figure out how to make it.\n\nThat attitude sums up California's economic development over the decade: incredible, and growing, wealth at the top, among the tech elite and the well-connected — while the poor grow, and the middle class stagnates, or leaves.\n\nAs Leo Tolstoy said, by way of Isaiah Berlin: The leaves of a tree delight us more than the roots. And the roots of California's progress have rotted over the past decade, under both Brown and Newsom, by a variety of measures.\n\nMiddle-class exodus: From 2007 to 2016, California lost a net million residents — some 2.5% of its population (which still grows due to births and immigration). The high cost of living — driven by high taxes and the shortage of housing — is a major factor. With homeowners and small business owners — the Republican base — leaving, Democrats and their policies become entrenched, though the state may lose a congressional seat after the Census.\n\nPower shortages: The state that leads the nation, and the world, in technological innovation cannot keep the lights on any longer — not since the Pacific Gas & Electric Company began shutting off the electricity last year during high winds to prevent wildfires and protect itself from liability. After focusing on green energy and letting nuclear plants go dark, the state government was unprepared for the basic task of making sure California had enough power.\n\nHomelessness: The most visible change in California over the past decade has been the surge in homelessness — 16.4% in 2018 alone, which entirely accounted for the nation's overall 2.7% rise. Tent cities are becoming a common sight in the big cities, and even in rural towns. The state has done nothing to address the root causes of homelessness; it keeps offering generous welfare benefits and asking the federal government for housing money.\n\nDrought: California suffered one of the worst droughts in its history for much of the decade. The effects were made worse because the state has failed to invest in new water storage infrastructure for decades. Though politicians point to climate change (inaccurately) as the cause of recent wildfires, poor forestry management — state and federal — plus restrictions on logging and poor residential planning have turned natural variation into man-made disasters.\n\nInfrastructure: The state suffers from a massive backlog in infrastructure spending. Democrats recently provided more funding for the state's roads — through an unpopular, regressive gas tax hike rather than spending cuts on less urgent priorities. But one of Newsom's first acts as governor was to cancel much of the state's high-speed rail plan, which had already sunk billions of federal dollars into plans for a rural segment no one had any interest in using.\n\nEducation: The past decade saw California schools continue to underperform. Reform movements, championing school choice, public charters, merit pay, and other proven innovations, gained support in minority communities and even won in local school board elections — only to be crushed, repeatedly, by teachers-union-backed candidates at the state level. For California's children, a decade of underachievement in public schools could have lifelong effects.\n\nCrime: Though crime remains at historically low levels, the past decade saw periods of increased crime in many areas, thanks in part to ill-conceived prison reforms such as Proposition 47, which focused on reducing sentences and downgrading many crimes. Notorious crimes committed by illegal aliens — such as the killing of Kate Steinle in 2015 — became national symbols of the lack of immigration enforcement and a general decline in the rule of law.\n\nAs this article was about to be published, Newsom added more claims about California's success:\n\nSpending some time looking back on 2019. CA made some serious first-in-the-nation and big moves… — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) January 2, 2020\n\nNoticeably absent: any mention of results, aside from the low unemployment rate, for which President Donald Trump can also claim credit.\n\nJoel B.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reviving the establishment's virtual wall policy on the southern border to soften her uncompromising opposition to President Donald Trump's push for a real fence on the border.\n\nWhat the President is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders … We all support border security, and there is a better way to do it … The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall, that can be built is what we should be doing, Pelosi said January 10.\n\nNancy Pelosi's border security fix: Repair the border roads so it's easier for immigrants to enter U.S.https://t.co/X6ePFKurDQ pic.twitter.com/sYPgLLxHV9 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 10, 2019\n\nPelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThey have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.\n\nThe Democrats' push for a technological wall, is also very important for the new Democrat legislators elected in swing-districts, she said, adding:\n\nThey know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border. The Democrats [in November] won because there were a lot of Democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as Republicans.\n\nPelosi also has to manage her raucous caucus, which includes moderates from swing-districts and progressives who back the Abolish ICE! slogan, Vaughan said.\n\nShe has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.\n\nOverall, the party want the charade of enforcement, not actual enforcement, and that is true of border security and every other type of enforcement, she said.\n\nOther Democrats are touting technology as a full or partial substitute for a real fence. CNN reported January 4:\n\nIt is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.\n\n.@RepCheri Bustos says the border wall has become nothing more than a symbol, but notes that in the end, we might have to give or take a little bit. It's just the way the world works.https://t.co/oiGb5OgcB7 pic.twitter.com/2aUrs7YK1Z — New Day (@NewDay) January 4, 2019\n\nPelosi is also trying to shift the debate away from fences and towards amnesties: We need to have comprehensive immigration reform … Dreamers and their families and the rest, she said January 10. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is what this debate frankly should be about, she said.\n\nThat Democrats' opposition to a wall is entwined with Democrats' increasing promotion of migrants above Americans and their children.\n\nOn January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.\n\nOn January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\n\nOn January 10, Pelosi said that Trump's proposed barrier to Central American migration is discriminatory.\n\nIn February 2018, Pelosi gave a long speech in the House where she praised illegal migrants as better than Americans:\n\nWe recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. It's a beautiful thing … Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so. We have to make [an amnesty] happen … Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American…\n\nDemocrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W. Bush and Obama ran that $1 billion scam from 2005 to 2015, but it only ensured more migrants, lower wages, and Trump's 2016 election. https://t.co/ZAQiunXoKl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The government of Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro this week pledged to privatize as many state-run industries as possible in an effort to drastically reduce the size of the state.\n\nBolsonaro's new Minister for Infrastructure, Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, revealed on Thursday that all airports managed today by state-owned Infraero will now be privatized, arguing that this would resolve the delay over contracts signed by former President Dilma Rousseff on the roads and at the Viracopos airport serving Sao Paulo state.\n\nEverything that can be privatized will be privatized, de Freitas said. We are going to test in March the auction of the three airport blocks.\n\nMinister of Economy Paulo Guedes claimed that the main priority of the administration involved the reform of the pension system, as well as widespread privatization and tax simplification.\n\nThe retirement system is currently a factory of inequalities, he explained. Those who legislate have the highest pensions, who they judge have the highest pensions. The Brazilian people and young people.\n\nBolsonaro also made a Twitter announcement about his economic plans on Thursday, promising to attract investment on transport systems such as trains, airports, and port terminals.\n\nWe will quickly attract initial investments for around 7 billion reals, with rail concessions, 12 airports, and 4 port terminals, he wrote. With the confidence of the investor in favorable conditions for the population, we will rescue the initial development of Brazilian infrastructure.\n\nRapidamente atrairemos investimentos iniciais em torno de R$ 7 bi, com concessões de ferrovia, 12 aeroportos e 4 terminais portuários. Com a confiança do investidor sob condições favoráveis à população resgataremos o desenvolvimento inicial da infraestrutura do Brasil. — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 3, 2019\n\nThe economic reforms are part of Bolsonaro's plan to reverse the calamitous socialist policies undertaken by former administrations. Excessive public spending led to a crippling recession that ended in 2017, leaving millions in unemployment and worsening the poverty they promised to eradicate.\n\nThis change in direction from previous administrations has excited investors around the world, many of whom believe Bolsonaro's leadership could revitalize Brazil's previously sluggish economy. The Brazilian stock market has already experienced an impressive rally since his election last October, hitting a new high of 91,564 points, with some analysts believing it could reach highs of between 100,000 and 120,000 points this year.\n\nAs part of his embrace of laissez-faire capitalism, Bolsonaro has also pledged to push back against communist movements around the world. Last month, the 63-year-old former army captain called for a global coalition against communism, instead urging people to support the wide struggle for freedom, democracy, and free commerce.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
An opinion piece published in the student newspaper at Texas State University this week tells white people that their DNA is an abomination.\n\nYou were not born white. You became white… You don't give a damn, author Rudy Martinez wrote in the University Star student newspaper.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Martinez was arrested in Washington, DC during President Trump's inauguration. Martinez attempted to crowdfund money to help pay his legal fees, raising $1,345 of a $2,000 goal.\n\nWhiteness will be over because we want it to be, Martinez wrote in the column. And when it dies, there will be millions of cultural zombies aimlessly wandering across a vastly changed landscape. Ontologically speaking, white death will mean liberation for all… Until then, remember this: I hate you because you shouldn't exist. You are both the dominant apparatus on the planet and the void in which all other cultures, upon meeting you, die.\n\nWhen I think of all the white people I have ever encountered – whether they've been professors, peers, lovers, friend, police officers, et cetera – there is perhaps only a dozen I would consider 'decent,' Martinez continued.\n\nThe piece was titled Your DNA is an abomination, and ran under a genre header simply labeled, whiteness. A photograph of the column from the newspaper was provided to the media by former student body president Andrew Homann.\n\nThis is blatant racism against white people for nothing other than the color of their skin. She literally states she hates white people because we shouldn't exist, Homann wrote on Facebook. No one is going to stop Rudy from accomplishing what she wants, I guess aside from her lack of intellect. No one is going to take this paper seriously if the editorial board continues to allow baseless garbage to be published week in and week out.\n\nI have no doubt that racism is still alive today. Look no further than this blatantly racist, divisive article posted by the University Star, Homann told the Washington Examiner. While I believe Mr. Martinez has every right to express his disparaging world-view, I am appalled that the school paper, funded by tuition and tax dollars, would give this guy a platform to do so.\n\nOn Tuesday, Denise Cervantes, the Editor-in-Chief of the University Star, published an editorial note about Martinez's column. The column has received widespread criticism from readers, with many expressing that they find the author's ideas to be racist, she wrote. The University Star's opinion pages are a forum for students to express and debate ideas. While our publication does not endorse every opinion put forth by student columnists or guest contributors, as the editor I take responsibility for what is printed on our pages.\n\nThe original intent of the column was to comment on the idea of race and racial identities, she finished. We acknowledge that the column could have been clearer in its message and that it has caused hurt within our campus community. We apologize and hope that we can move forward to a place of productive dialogue on ways to bring our community together.\n\nMartinez's column no longer appears on the University Star website.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove references to Texas Tech that were originally included.
Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against South Carolina in the wake of Gov. Henry McMaster's executive order banning abortion providers from the state's list of Medicaid providers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic argues that Medicaid patients have the right to choose Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider, reports the Post and Courier. The abortion facility also contends that South Carolina already has a shortage of healthcare providers.\n\nJenny Black, the Planned Parenthood affiliate's CEO, said Planned Parenthood and its patients are being irreparably harmed by the governor's order.\n\nThe women and men who come to Planned Parenthood for healthcare aren't doing so to make a political statement, she said. Every day that this continues, both (Planned Parenthood) and our patients are irreparably harmed.\n\nBrian Symmes, a spokesman for McMaster, said in a statement:\n\nGov. McMaster ordered (Health and Human Services) to continue reimbursing family planning providers because he recognizes how important those services are. But like millions of South Carolinians, he believes in the fundamental right to life for unborn children and does not believe tax dollars should go to organizations that perform elective abortions, and he will fight this foolish lawsuit with everything he has.\n\nIn his executive order, the Republican governor made a clear distinction between family planning services and abortion.\n\nAlthough the state should not contract with abortion clinics for family planning services, the state also should not deny South Carolinians' access to necessary medical care and important women's health and family planning services, which are provided by a variety of other non-governmental entities and governmental agencies, McMaster said.\n\nFederally qualified healthcare facilities in South Carolina that accept Medicaid as payment and provide more expansive health services than abortion clinics can be accessed at getyourcare.org. Since 2015, such federally qualified healthcare providers outnumbered Planned Parenthood clinics 268 to 2 in South Carolina.\n\nMcMaster also ordered the state's health agency to use funds left over from last year's budget for health care services for low-income individuals in South Carolina. The governor vetoed nearly $16 million for low-income individuals from the coming year's budget in order to cut Planned Parenthood's funding. The excess funds from last year's budget are providing monies for low-income services without funding abortion clinics.
Why, in the last 12 days of his presidency, did Donald Trump suddenly become the authoritarian of liberal fantasies? He sure wasn't an authoritarian for the past four years — he was a spineless wonder.\n\nWhen it came to the wall, bringing the troops home, ending hedge fund managers' tax loopholes and other campaign promises, Trump backed down to everybody: district court judges, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the de facto president Jared Kushner, trusted Goldman Sachs alumnus Gary Cohn, useless donors, or any two people raising an objection.\n\nOK, never mind. I didn't know I'd have to get out of my chair. I'll just lie and tell my supporters it's already done.\n\nBut this time, it was finally about him.\n\nFor the items on Trump's 2016 campaign agenda, he actually had solid arguments. On overturning the election, he has no argument at all.\n\nThe bulk of Trump's rally speech last Wednesday consisted of the fanatically detailed claims of a paranoid about the election being stolen. The media, of course, have barely covered this part of the speech, since they're determined to suppress all mentions of any oting-vay aud-fray.\n\nNot to worry, media! I'm angrier after reading Trump's full exegesis on the election than I was when you were hiding it from me.\n\nHe cited vote tallies in this and that county, the media's use of suppression polls, constitutional provisions, the precise time of day votes came in, different states' voting rules and practices, the numbers of felons, dead people and illegal aliens who allegedly voted in various states, and on and on and on.\n\nDo you think Trump has any idea how many illegal aliens are in the country right now?\n\nNone whatsoever. Trump knows more about the accuracy settings on signature verification machines in Clark County, Nevada, than he does about DACA.\n\nFor four years, I've been told that Trump couldn't keep his campaign promises because: No one has ever faced such historic resistance! It's not his fault. Poor Trump!\n\nWell, how hard was it to keep his promises compared to overturning a presidential election?\n\nNow that we've gotten a bracing view of Trump's skills as a demagogue, I just want to know: Why didn't he ever use his powers for good? Why did he never hold a rally on the ellipse and ask his supporters to pressure their representatives to fund the wall? To repeal Section 230? To penalize outsourcing?\n\nNone of those proposals is insane. Now that I think about it, they are the exact ideas that got Trump elected. Another plus: Asking his supporters to lobby for popular issues would not have ended with senators and House members fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven as he was goading his most gullible supporters into criminal activity and — in one case — death, he still didn't give a crap about them.\n\nTrump was delighted by the mob he'd unleashed on the Capitol, but according to sources, appalled by how badly dressed they were. He expressed disgust on aesthetic grounds over how 'low class' his supporters looked, one Trump adviser told New York magazine, adding, He doesn't like low-class things.\n\nWhy are the cameras showing only my overweight supporters? Where are the hot women?\n\nYes, these were the deplorables, the left-behind, working-class Americans hanging on by their fingernails, who had bet their last dollar on Trump. (While we're on the subject, please drop the coup talk, media. We've seen the pictures. These weren't exactly Master of the Universe types.)\n\nDemocrats despise them, and Trump uses them.\n\nFor four years, Trump screwed over these very working-class Americans while giving Sheldon Adelson, Wall Street, and McConnell everything they wanted — sometimes things they didn't even ask for!\n\nClose your eyes … Surprise! I'm giving you the West Bank, too!\n\n(I admire Israel's gumption and even wish we could be more like them, but, seriously, did they even ask for approval of their settlements?)\n\nAt the same time, Trump said to the deplorables: Sorry, I guess we didn't have time to get to the wall…\n\nSo obviously, when it came to launching a mad plan with zero chance of success solely to benefit himself, Trump turned to the weakest members of society, the very people whom he had used to get elected and then betrayed. (Trump's best buddy, Benjamin Netanyahu, congratulated Joe Biden seconds after he was declared the winner.)\n\nIn his rally speech, Trump vowed he'd march to the Capitol with them. Go fight that guy! I'll be right behind you. After the rally, of course, he immediately repaired to the White House, where he could enjoy a nice lunch and watch the poor saps on TV.\n\nTrump sees other humans only in terms of what they can do for him. He will ask for favor after favor after favor, no matter how humiliating or burdensome, but the moment someone says no, will viciously attack him. Ask Jeff Sessions.\n\nThus, Trump came up with the manifestly insane idea that his vice president, Mike Pence, should refuse to certify the electoral votes. All Vice President Pence has to do, Trump said at the rally, is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people. It's even good for me, too!\n\nOn and on he went: So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.\n\nThe vice president, not being a lunatic, had already declined Trump's very special offer — limited time only! — earlier that morning. Trump was setting up his supporters to be furious with Pence when they got to the Capitol and realized he had not awarded the election to Trump.\n\nAt 2:24 p.m., as Trump watched the mob streaming through the Capitol, he tweeted: Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution … Whereupon, some in the crowd began chanting, Hang Mike Pence!\n\nTrump never called to find out if Pence and his family were safe.\n\nFor 48 hours, Trump didn't lower the White House flag to half-mast in honor of Brian Sicknick, the Trump-supporting Capitol Hill Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the siege. The guy could at least have worn a decent shirt. Nor did he call Sicknick's family. Pence did.\n\nSometimes you get the feeling Trump's not really thinking about other people.\n\nThe reason Trump was a lazy, feckless coward for the past four years was that, once it got him elected, he didn't see how the MAGA agenda did anything for him. And the reason he became a whirling dervish of demagogic activity last week was that it was all about him.
Top industry bosses from Britain to Asia have seen staggering salary increases over the past several years, while worker wages in their respective countries have continued to lag far behind.\n\nLeading the pack in the United Kingdom is Britain's Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, the world's largest advertising company. Sorrell took home $90 million in salary and bonus in 2015 — up from his $65 million haul from the year before.\n\nThere is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages, said High Pay Centre director, Stefan Stern. In spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.\n\nStern's outfit published its annual survey, earlier this month, on earnings at the Financial Times Stock Exchange's top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe largest public companies in London earned an average of $7 million last year and have benefitted from a 10 percent pay raise while wages in the rest of the economy have declined.\n\nThe trend has extended beyond Great Britain's borders.\n\nCEOs in Japan — where 80 percent of the highest-paid executives are from other countries — take home about 67 times more than the average worker. The typical Australian CEO makes 93 times more.\n\nThe average salary of CEOs in India has doubled over the last two years.\n\nTop executives in the U.S. have seen similar salary inflation while worker wages have stagnated.\n\nAt McDonald's in 2014, the CEO to average worker pay ratio was 644 to 1, according to a Bloomberg News analysis.\n\nA 2016 report by Lawrence Mishel and Jessica Schieder of the Economic Policy Institute said CEOs from the 350 largest U.S.-based companies by sales took home an average of 276 times what the average worker at their company earns.\n\nDecades before the current rise in worldwide globalism, the United States Congress passed an Internal Revenue Service rule requiring all salaries above $1 million to be deemed as performance-based, forcing corporate tax deductions to kick in. Instead of slashing corporate pay, the law led to a rise in salaries. Companies, advised by high-priced consultants, began giving out stock options tied to performance-based goals that paved the way to the wide pay gap in today's global workforce, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nToday, from a maximum wage proposal to a push to raise the federal minimum wage, there's seemingly more makeshift solutions to the problem than there is political will to solve it.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
The Algemeiner reports: JNS.org – The French government has denied a controversial report regarding a secretive department within the French Finance Ministry that allegedly targets Jews for tax evasion. France's General Directorate of Public Finance (DGFiP) stated that it categorically denies the completely unfounded assertions released today in the Globes newspaper, about the creation of a French tax department specializing in French Jews.\n\nThere is no such structure within the French tax administration. The French tax law forbids any distinction between people based on their origin, place of residence, nationality or religion, DGFiP added.\n\nThe denial came after the Israeli financial news outlet Globes reported last week that a one of a kind investigative department in France's Finance Ministry had 20 Hebrew-speaking employees and was in the process of hiring additional workers. The employees in the department were purportedly experts in Israeli law and able to discern whether or not French Jews were using Israel as a tax haven.\n\nRead more here.
In a column for the Hollywood Reporter, Senior Editor Eriq Gardner notes that Hollywood's major film industry players — who have often been the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump and his administration's policies — could actually be among the greatest beneficiaries of the president's proposed tax cuts.\n\nFrom the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nIf Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn't just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones — almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous.\n\nAs the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including pass-through organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to employee-owners and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish mini-corporations for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent.\n\nGuess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to loan-out corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas, alongside the 21st Century Fox's and Time Warner's come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling), Kimsaprincess Inc. (Kim Kardashian), Snooker Doodle (Emily Deschanel), Rogue Marble (Sylvester Stallone) and so forth.\n\n…
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.\n\nWhen asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nHe further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence was then asked, So, eventually it's going to come down to that binary choice. And you're going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?\n\nHe answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.\n\nHe concluded, The central element of the president's vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
President Trump called out Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Twitter, Sunday, referring to the billionaire as Jeff Bozo in a post to Twitter.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post, President Trump declared.

A Kansas man has requested that an Iowa court grant his motion for a trial by combat to settle a custody dispute with his ex-wife and her attorney on the battlefield.\n\nDavid Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, has cited in court documents that his ex-wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, has destroyed (him) legally, the Des Moines Register reported Monday.\n\nThe Carroll Times-Herald reported that Ostrom filed a request with the Iowa District Court in Shelby County to give him 12 weeks to source or forge Japanese swords used in battle.\n\nTo this day, trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States, Ostrom argues in court records, adding that it was used as recently as 1818 in British Court.\n\nOstrom told the Register that he got the idea for the duel after he learned about a 2016 New York Supreme Court case in which New York Supreme Court Justice Philip Minardo said that duels had not been abolished under state law.\n\nOstrom said the motion began when he became frustrated with his ex-wife's attorney, Matthew Hudson, saying he wanted to take the fight to the field of battle where (he) will rend their souls from their corporal bodies.\n\nHudson filed a resistance to Ostrom's trial by combat motion by doing a little spelling check.\n\nSurely (Ostrom) meant 'corporeal' bodies which Merriam Webster defines as having, consisting of, or relating to, a physical material body, the attorney wrote. Although (Ostrom) and potential combatant do have souls to be rended, they respectfully request that the court not order this done.\n\nHudson argued that a duel could end in one or both parties dying, which could outweigh custody and property tax issues.\n\nIt should be noted that just because the U.S. and Iowa constitutions do not specifically prohibit battling another person with a deadly katana sword, it does prohibit a court sitting in equity from ordering same, Hudson wrote.\n\nThe Iowa attorney also asked that the court take away Ostrom's visitation rights and make him undergo court-ordered psychotherapy.\n\nOstrom later admitted to misspelling the word but argued that he did not have any mental health issues.\n\nThe court has not made a decision on either party's motions.\n\nIn modern times, the right to trial by combat has been struck down in other courts around the world. In a 2003 case in the United Kingdom, a court ruled against a man who wished to invoke a trial by combat to settle a £25 fine for a minor motor vehicle offense, the Telegraph reported.
Foxconn Technology had big plans to build television displays in Wisconsin.\n\nThen the price of televisions in the United States crashed.\n\nFoxconn said Wednesday that it is rethinking its ambitious plans to build LCD displays in a factory in Wisconsin. In an interview with Reuters, a Foxconn executive said the company would instead use the site for research purposes rather than manufacturing.\n\nThe compaany said it remains committed to the project, the creation of 13,000 jobs and to our long-term investment in Wisconsin. But because the global market environment that existed when the project was first announced in 2017 has shifted, this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn did not provide details about what global market changes had impacted its plans.\n\nMedia reports have cited tight labor markets and higher wages in the U.S. Manufacturing labor costs, however, are up just over 2 percent for the year.\n\nLouis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn CEO Terry Gou, told Reuters in a story published Wednesday that it is scaling back and possibly shelving plans to build liquid crystal display panel screens.\n\nIn terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S., Woo told Reuters. We can't compete.\n\nThe biggest challenge to its original plan to invest $10 billion to build a 22-million square foot liquid-crystal display panel plant is not labor costs in the U.S. What has changed is that the prices of televisions have undergone a stunning decline.\n\nCompared with a year ago, television prices have declined 18.6 percent, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThat makes it much harder to turn a profit while paying workers in the U.S.\n\nThere's no ready explanation for the decline in television prices. Industry experts say a slowdown in housing may be playing a role, although the price drop has been so steep that the housing market's woes seem insufficient. Some, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said it is possible foreign manufacturers are illegally dumping televisions on the U.S. market at cut-rate prices.\n\nFoxconn is based in Taiwan but does the bulk of its manufacturing, including making Apple's iPhones, in China. It is the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and the largest private employer in China.\n\nThe much-ballyhooed facility was heralded by President Donald Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to return manufacturing to the Midwest and the United States. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has criticized the tax incentives offered to Foxconn as too generous.\n\nAmerica is open for business more than it has ever been open for business. Made in the USA: It's all happening and it's happening very, very quickly, Trump said in June after visiting the Foxconn site. Today we're seeing the results of the pro-America agenda. America First, Make America Great Again. Greatest phrase ever used in politics, I suspect.\n\nEvery step of the way Foxconn has overpromised and under-delivered, said Democratic Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in a statement. This news is devastating for the taxpayers of Wisconsin. We were promised manufacturing jobs. We were promised state of the art LCD production. We were promised a game-changing economic opportunity for our state. And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S. — leaving another state and community high and dry.\n\nThe president of Wisconsin's Technology Council, Tom Still, said he's not surprised that Foxconn wants to change course since televisions are becoming less expensive and iPhone sales are declining.\n\nStill, a supporter of the project, noted the company has already invested as much as $200 million in Wisconsin so he's not worried that the company might pull out.\n\nI do think that it's likely that they'll adjust to what the market conditions are, said Still, whose group nurtures tech in Wisconsin and advises state leaders on policy.\n\n–The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Less than a year after Massachusetts voters approved legalizing marijuana and taxing it at a rate of 12 percent, lawmakers already seek a larger take of the dealer's cut.\n\nIn shifting marijuana from decriminalized to legal status, voters permitted a maximum tax of 12 percent on sales of the sweet leaf. Seven months later, the state legislature seeks to grab more of pot profits by permitting taxes as high as 28 percent.\n\nIt's not as though those in the reefer business didn't see the state coming for their business.\n\nNine years ago, I sat down with two longtime pot dealers in the Beacon Hill Pub a short walk from where the Great and General Court does business. The sixtysomething sinsemilla sectaries viewed legalization as a way to corporatize a mom-and-pop enterprise.\n\nShould it be legal? Yes. Do we want it legal? No, declared cue-balled Charlie, dealing for decades within eyeshot of the state capitol. Mark, sporting a Pancho Villa mustache, informed, Every time I go over to Hempfest, I chant: 'Keep Marijuana Illegal.\n\nAt the time, a pot legalization proposal sought to impose a $150-an-ounce tax on the low-grade marijuana most commonly bought and smoked. In effect, the proposal aimed to double the price of a joint. This go-around, the proposed law allows for an end-around on the taxes by smokers using medical marijuana, which the bill exempts from the proposed taxation.\n\nIf you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldn't necessarily be cost prohibitive, Mark explained. But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that.\n\nApart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the state's imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to abide by an affirmative action program in hiring.\n\nFor pot dealers not keen on turning over their profits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or eager to undergo annual audits, the law establishes a division of cannabis enforcement in the attorney general's office regarding a product that voters just legalized and long ago decriminalized.\n\nIronically, veteran dealers such as Mark and Charlie face a government more eager to put them out of business now than when they peddled an illegal product as consumers may boost their business by more enthusiastically turning to their cheaper, black-market pot.\n\nThe more than 54 percent who voted to legalize marijuana in November's election authorized a tax of no more than 12 percent. The 28 percent tax represents a 133 percent increase over the initial rate. Legislators seek to hold a vote on Thursday. Smoking citizens may counter by voting with their wallets.
Officials from the Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union have made contact with the City to discuss the best way to sever ties with the political bloc before the Government triggers Article 50.\n\nMeetings have been held between the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and top business lobby groups including the British Bankers' Association, the Confederation of British Industry, and City of London on how best to exit the European Union (EU), with officials wanting to draw up a plan of action before Article 50 is triggered, the Daily Express reported.\n\nThey have also had input from David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, who has been dubbed Minister for Brexit.\n\nThe Department has said: We are in the process of consulting various stakeholders, including the City of London, to ensure our approach will get the best deal for Britain.\n\nIt has been reported that officials have discussed the issue of passporting rights, which allow UK-based banks to set up branches in countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Talks have revealed a willingness among some top figures to abandon passporting, despite early calls to stay in the single market.\n\nMark Boleat has said: It's no good having a wish list that's not realistic – that's not what the Government wants. What it wants to know is: does Brexit mean the loss of 5pc of investment banking jobs? In which case – OK. If it means the loss of 30pc of these jobs, then what's the implication of tax revenue? Is passporting worth fighting for?\n\nMr. Boleat has cast doubt over the possibility of the UK securing a Norway-style deal to remain in the EEA, saying that accepting the free movement of people and accepting EU rules whilst paying large sums to Brussels would not be politically acceptable.\n\nAnthony Browne, Chief Executive of the British Bankers' Association, has said: We are not calling for membership of the single market – what we want is full two-way access to EU markets.\n\nNews of the discussions came as a survey conducted by ConservativeHome has shown that grassroots Conservative members do not think that the Norway option would not be a good deal for Britain.\n\nA majority of those polled at 69 per cent want a deal where the UK does not remain a single market member, and immigration is subject to full control rather than a time-limited emergency brake. This is compared to just 26% who wanted a Norway-style arrangement with the EU.\n\nNorway is part of the EEA, and apart from fisheries and agriculture, all other rules, including product registration and workers' regulations, are dictated by the EU. Legislation is made in Brussels without Norway's contribution to the decision making.\n\nUnder the European Economic Area Agreement. the Scandinavian country pays annually €391 million to 15 beneficiary states, €447 million a year to participate in certain EU schemes, and well as other smaller contributions – still in the millions of euros – to access other schemes.\n\nIn exchange, Norway has access to the single market – but must have free movement of people, an issue that swung the EU referendum vote in favour of Brexit.\n\nFollow Victoria Friedman on Twitter Follow @friedmanpress or e-mail: vfriedman@breitbart.com
President Joe Biden on his first day on the job axed the Keystone XL Pipeline, drawing the ire of union workers, industry stakeholders, and GOP lawmakers whose states will be negatively impacted by the decision.\n\nMike Sommers, president and CEO of trade group American Petroleum Institute, said Biden's announcement is a slap in the face to the thousands of union workers who are already a part of this safe and sustainable project.\n\nThis misguided move will hamper America's economic recovery, undermine North American energy security, and strain relations with one of America's greatest allies, Sommers said.\n\nMark McManus, general president of the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, said in a statement:\n\nIn revoking this permit, the Biden Administration has chosen to listen to the voices of fringe activists instead of union members and the American consumer on Day 1. Let me be very clear: When built with union labor by the men and women of the United Association, pipelines like Keystone XL remain the safest and most efficient modes of energy transportation in the world.\n\nSadly, the Biden administration has now put thousands of union workers out of work, McManus said. For the average American family, it means energy costs will go up and communities will no longer see the local investments that come with pipeline construction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board also responded to Biden's move, concluding that not only is it destructive to the U.S. economy but possibly illegal:\n\nSince 2000 the U.S. has led the world in energy-related emissions reductions as natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing has replaced coal in power production. China's Paris commitment doesn't require it to cut emissions for another decade. Russia's are set to rise for years. Last November Russian oil giant Rosneft launched a massive exploration project in the Arctic. Mineral resources will remain a competitive advantage of Russia's economy, and will determine the place and role of the country in the world, Russia's strategic mineral plan says. Killing Keystone won't keep fossil fuels in the ground. It will merely strand billions of dollars in Canadian investment and kill thousands of U.S. jobs while enriching adversaries and alienating an ally. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has promised to use all legal avenues available to protect its Keystone investment if Mr. Biden killed the pipeline. [TC Energy] can avail itself of Nafta's investor-dispute settlement provision until June 2022, which would allow it to recoup its investment. The company also has a strong legal case that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the President, power over foreign trade and that Mr. Biden's reversal violates due process.\n\nAnd some members of Congress are fighting back by introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the pipeline. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) said:\n\nIt's only day one, and with the stroke of a pen, Biden has already taken steps to kill American energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline which is critical to energy producing states like Montana. This project will create thousands of jobs, generate tax revenue for local communities, promote North American energy security and independence, and it is the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil. We must do all that we can to ensure construction moves forward.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-OK) said:\n\nWe came so far during the last administration – from prioritizing American energy development to ending the far-left's war on fossil fuels. The Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation and President Biden's disappointing choice today to revoke this permit will harm the nation's tremendous progress toward energy independence. I am sad to see this decision to continue the failed Obama-era legacy of denying tens of thousands of Americans good, well-paying jobs at the expense of satisfying liberal, 'Green New Deal' inspired interest groups.\n\nIt is a sad day for the future of American energy independence, but I will not stop fighting for legislation and other policies that keep energy costs down and further our energy and national security, Inhofe.\n\n[Keystone XL Pipeline is expected to provide approximately 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generate tax revenue, increase renewable-energy demand, reduce emissions and strengthen North American energy independence, the lawmakers' press release said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
Tuesday on ABC's The View, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said it is fantastic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is challenging the status quo, with policy proposals reflecting the ideology of the socialist left.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical.

Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?\n\nHARRIS: No. You know, I think she's challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. I think that. You know, I used to teach, before, especially before, the last few years. And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on Thursday called on Congress to investigate Robinhood's decision to restrict purchases of GameStop shares after Reddit users sent the stock soaring this week.\n\nWe need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that, Khanna wrote on Twitter. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices.\n\nYes @aoc. We need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices. https://t.co/mYX8Ab3JwH — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) January 28, 2021\n\nKhanna's comment came in response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expressing support for the House Committee on Financial Services to hold a hearing on Robinhood's actions.\n\nWe now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit. As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans such as Ted Cruz (TX) and Mike Lee (UT) also signaled their support in getting to the bottom of Robinhood's stock trading restrictions.\n\nWe should investigate, Lee said.\n\nRobinhood and other retail brokerages are taking steps to tamp down the speculative frenzy surrounding companies such as GameStop, but the actions only sparked more volatility and an outcry from users of the platforms and some members of Congress that small investors are being treated unfairly.\n\nGameStop stock has rocketed from below $20 earlier to close around $350 Wednesday as a volunteer army of investors on social media challenged big institutions who had placed market bets that the stock would fall.\n\nThe action was even wilder Thursday: The stock swung between $112 and $483. At midday it was down 27% at $255.\n\nRobinhood said Thursday investors would only be able to sell their positions and not open new ones in some cases, and Robinhood will try to slow the amount of trading using borrowed money.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
More than 20 Manhattan investigators from the district attorney's office raided the offices of Newsweek magazine and its parent company IBT Media on Thursday, reports say.\n\nInvestigators were seen photographing Newsweek's servers, but it appeared at the time that no files were downloaded, according to the New York Post.\n\nOne source said that the investigators were paying special attention to the serial numbers on the servers.\n\nEmployees initially reported that the investigators were from the New York Police Department, but a department spokesman said the NYPD was not involved in the raid.\n\nLast month, the IRS placed a $1.2 million tax lien against Etienne Uzac, co-founder of IBT Media, owner of the magazine. IBT purchased Newsweek in 2013 after it had announced the end of its print edition. Under its new owners, the magazine reemerged as a print edition in 2014. the magazine's home offices double as IBT Media HQ.\n\nNeither Newsweek, its owners, nor the Manhattan DA's office have issued any statement about Thursday's raid.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Americans in the market for luxury homes are searching in the French Riviera because of President Trump, according to a real estate expert.\n\nWhile many Americans are also looking to buy properties overseas because of a strong dollar and low interest rates, one real estate expert says that President Trump's election has caused a spike in luxury housing sales, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMy phone started ringing the morning after he became president, and it hasn't stopped since, said Adrian Leeds, a Paris-based real estate expert who was born in the United States and is a regular guest on HGTV's House Hunters International.\n\nI'm signing contracts every single day from Americans who are either getting the hell out of Dodge or are thinking that they need backup homes. There are people who have profited from the stock market, and they don't know what effect Trump's going to have going forward, so they're looking for somewhere to put their money, Leeds added.\n\nFor prospective home buyers in France, there is no residency requirement to own a home there, and there are low property taxes. However, it is also difficult for many Americans to get a mortgage in France, and properties priced at $1 million or more have a higher tax rate.\n\nProperty taxes in France went up by an average of 14.7 percent between 2010-2015, according to English-language French news site the Local.\n\nAmerican homeowners who seek to rent their homes out are taxed on their profits, and people who own their homes for less than 15 years pay a capital gains tax of about 33 percent.\n\nBut despite the trade-offs of home ownership in France, real estate agents say it is a great time to buy property in France.\n\nIt is actually a buyer's market. There are a lot of properties for sale, but it's also a very stable market, said Angie Delattre, who works for a luxury property firm that specializes in real estate in the French Riviera.\n\nSome people have decided to give up their homes in favor of traveling the world. One such Maryland couple sold their house and embarked on a journey around the world in search of a new home after Trump's election.
Chancellor George Osborne has used the death of Jo Cox MP to demand Brexit supporters use more facts and less divisive political debate seconds before comparing UKIP to the Nazis and reasserting his discredited doomsday predictions for the economy.\n\nLook, first of all, I hope because of the tragic death of Jo [Cox] we can have a less divisive political debate in our country, he said on ITV this morning.\n\nAnd, particularly in the last few days of this referendum, we can have less baseless assertion and inflammatory rhetoric and more reasoned argument and facts, he added.\n\nThen, in the same interview, he went on to say that UKIP and Nigel Farage's breaking point poster was disgusting and vile, and had echoes of 1930s Nazi propaganda – himself echoing writers in the Guardian and a trades union boss, Dave Prentis of Unison, who reported the poster to the police for inciting hatred.\n\nYet even fellow Conservative MPs were shocked at how the Chancellor had so bluntly and shamelessly used the good name of the late Ms. Cox for political capital, just 48 hours after her death.\n\nMr. Osborne said UKIP were whipping up concerns, whipping up division, and making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey.\n\nAdding: That is what we should say no to. And, this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want… do we want a meaner, narrower Britain that is poorer in every sense of the word? he asked.\n\nFor the remaining days [of the campaign], the people who are undecided in this referendum do want to hear the reasoned arguments and they want to hear the facts, he also said.\n\nAdding: And, I think it's important for people to understand that if we vote leave there is no turning back. It's a one-way door to a much more uncertain world where people's jobs and their livelihoods are at risk.\n\nGeorge Osborne's idea of reasoned argument and facts — presented in the past week — include his widely mocked doomsday predictions for a post-Brexit economy, based on figures from an independent organisation mostly funded by the European Union (EU) and British government.\n\nHis so-called 'Brexit emergency budget' was slammed by dozens of MPs in his own party, who promised to vote it down, as it was effectively using his power to threaten voters with punitive cuts and tax rises if they choose to vote against him.
The president of Jefferson Parish (JP) in Louisiana is facing petitions for recall after refusing to resign his post following allegations that he sent sexually explicit text messages to a 17 year-old boy.\n\nMike Yenni, a 40 year-old married father and lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, admits he sent inappropriate text messages to a teen boy when he was mayor of Kenner in 2015. Yenni did not indicate the details of the message nor identify the boy, reports WDSU.\n\nJefferson Parish Pres Mike Yenni in closed-door meeting with administration. @wdsu details @ 6 pic.twitter.com/Abbbts2QhF — Jennifer Crockett (@CrockettWDSU) October 10, 2016\n\nFBI investigators have interviewed at least four people regarding the sexting messages. Yenni – who has not been charged with a crime – sent sexually explicit text message to the teen after noticing him at a high school event, reports WWL-TV, which continues:\n\nThe youth who received the messages said Yenni, who was then the mayor of Kenner, first saw him at a function at his high school, a local Catholic institution. He said a mutual friend, who was 19 at the time, helped Yenni connect with him. … The friend, who allegedly helped connect the two, declined to be interviewed by WWL-TV. The youth said he and Yenni began to talk on the phone and text one another, and soon, the politician came to visit him at his job at a mall food court. They met in a bathroom, the youth said, and Yenni gave him some designer underwear. They kissed briefly. The texting continued, becoming more explicit over time. The youth provided WWL-TV what he says are copies of the text exchanges that were recovered after they were deleted, on the condition that the station not directly quote from them. Printouts of the messages appear to indicate they came from a cell phone account linked to Yenni in multiple online search engines. WWL-TV called the number in June and got the same outgoing voicemail message, featuring Yenni's voice, as could be heard on Yenni's official parish cell phone at the time. The phone listed on the printouts of the text messages is not billed to taxpayers. According to printouts of those texts, Yenni tells the teen he wants him naked. Days later, Yenni writes to ask the 17-year-old if he's worn the underwear Yenni bought him. Yenni says he wants to see him model it. Then Yenni texts the teen to say he wants to perform a sex act on him that night. The youth, who is openly gay and is now in college, said in an interview with WWL-TV that he wants to expose Yenni's behavior because he finds it disturbing. While the youth was initially flattered and intrigued by Yenni's overtures, he said the texts and phone conversations began to make him uncomfortable, such as one proposing three-way sex with him and the 19-year-old mutual friend. He asked me to go with him to his house in Oxford (Mississippi), the youth said. Records show Yenni owns an apartment there. Also, the way he would describe the sexual things he wanted to do to me. And he asked me to be a secretary or assistant in his office; that way I could be with him and not be questioned. Weeks after the sexting began, in June 2015, the youth said he broke off communication and blocked Yenni's number.\n\nIn a statement from his office Monday, Yenni, a Republican, announced that he will not resign his position because the incident at the center of this allegation is personal and, in no way, does it impact my ability to govern.\n\nI have read with humility your request for my resignation, Yenni said. While I understand your position and your concerns, I have and will continue to dutifully perform the obligations of the Office of Parish President.\n\nYenni continued:\n\nAs I noted in my statement, my actions are regrettable, and I am penitent. I have accepted responsibility for my poor judgment, and I apologized publicly to all parties involved. I did not violate any laws, I have not been contacted by any investigatory agency, especially the FBI, regarding this allegation. I want to put this in the proper perspective. I have been true to the oath that I have taken. I stated clearly that I never abused or misused my powers as a public official and there has been no misuse of tax dollars or public assets. And, I will work harder than ever to prove that good can rise from a bad decision.\n\nYenni is facing a chorus of calls for his resignation and warnings to stay clear of school campuses.\n\nJefferson Parish Council members called upon Yenni to resign, and the school board discussed banning him from their schools. Both the Gretna and Westwego City Councils voted for his resignation. Assessor Tom Capella, clerk of court Jon Gegenheimer, coroner Gerry Cvitanovich and sheriff Newell Normand also called for Yenni's resignation.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, cancelled his fundraiser scheduled with Yenni, citing the deeply concerning allegations.\n\nNationally, the New York Post cited Yenni's bizarre infomercial in which he admitted to the sexting scandal.\n\nMetairie attorney Robert Evans III filed a petition Wednesday to begin a recall.\n\nAttorney G. Patrick Hand III tells Breitbart News he is also filing for a recall drive. In his petition, Hand says:\n\nI don't care about Mr. Yenni's sexual preference (male or female). It makes absolutely no difference to me. However, the fact that Mr. Yenni did this with a minor, regardless of the age of consent in LA (17 y.o.a.), is very disturbing to me and many others. The fact that Mr. Yenni met his victim at an alumni function held by Mr. Yenni's Alma Mater, which is the same school the victim attended at the time (Jesuit High School), is very disturbing to me and many others. Many people believe Mr. Yenni used his power and influence to gain access to the 17 year old boy in question, and that he has used his power and influence to attempt to gain access to other minors. I am being told by members of Mr. Yenni's own family that there is much more to this story than simply sending inappropriate texts to a young man, as Mr. Yenni put it in his recent apology video.\n\nTerri Timmcke, a Jefferson Parish resident who asked for Yenni's resignation at the JP Council meeting and is also a member of the STOP Common Core Coalition in Louisiana, tells Breitbart News, The members of the activist group are all concerned about the welfare of our school children, and so many are sharing information on social media sites and contacting public officials in the hopes that widespread outrage will compel President Yenni to resign.\n\nMy biggest fear is that we, as a society, are now going to accept immoral behavior from public officials as long as it is not technically 'illegal,' she added.\n\nBreitbart News contacted Yenni for comment through his email address but received no response.
Multinational corporation General Motors (GM) sought to import nearly 2,800 foreign workers in the last three years to take U.S. jobs while laying off American workers.\n\nGM will be laying off at least 4,250 of its white-collar workers in Canada and America — with the vast majority in the U.S. — starting next week.\n\nThe layoffs are just a small component of the corporation's mass layoff scheme of 14,700 workers in North America — including at least 3,300 American factory workers. Meanwhile, GM is ramping up production of electric cars in China.\n\nIn 2019, GM expects to stop production at four American plants, including Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren Transmission in Michigan, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, and Baltimore Operations in Maryland. This comes after GM laid off about 1,500 American workers in Lordstown in 2018, while their Mexico production remained unaffected.\n\nAt the same time GM has been laying off American workers, the corporation has been importing foreign workers from countries like India, China, Brazil, and South Korea.\n\nBlack Monday: GM to Layoff 4K American White-Collar Workershttps://t.co/2seec0UrBv — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 2, 2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, GM attempted to outsource nearly 700 American jobs in Warren, Michigan, to foreign workers brought in on the H-1B visa. The corporation also tried to outsource 167 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign workers in Detroit, Michigan, another 154 U.S. jobs in Milford, Michigan, an additional 82 U.S. jobs in Pontiac, Michigan, and about 20 U.S. jobs in Roswell, Georgia.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nLast year, alone, U.S. businesses attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 American jobs to foreign workers, a population that exceeds the total population of Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe U.S. high-paying jobs GM outsourced to foreign workers while laying off American workers over the last three years include nearly 320 electrical engineering jobs, nearly 320 mechanical engineering jobs, more than 220 software developer jobs, and about 66 commercial and industrial designer jobs.\n\nGM even outsourced nearly 150 U.S. jobs at its financial services wing in Arlington, Fort Worth, and Irving, Texas, as well as financial jobs in Detroit, Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina. The vast majority of these foreign workers imported to take these jobs were from India.\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) union has launched a campaign urging consumers to boycott GM for their offshoring and outsourcing business practices that is leaving thousands of American workers laid off just years after the corporation was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers and received a massive tax cut.\n\nCompanies like General Motors have an obligation to build where they sell and stop exporting jobs abroad, UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement. After all, we invested in General Motors in their darkest days. Now they need to invest in us.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, more than 2.7 million H-1B foreign workers have been approved to come to the U.S. to take American jobs between 2007 and 2017. During that same period, businesses tried to outsource almost 3.5 million American jobs to foreign workers instead of hiring Americans.\n\nAbout four million young Americans enter the workforce each year, many looking for white-collar jobs in the STEM fields. Those Americans' prospects of finding work are crippled by the country's legal immigration process, which admits more than 1.5 million immigrants and hundreds of thousands of foreign visa workers annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The New York Times on Friday begrudgingly acknowledged that Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite, the latest blockbuster investigative work by Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer, contains building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nThe Times featured a piece by Nicole Hemmer, who, throughout the piece, charges conservative media with minimizing not just impeachment but the full array of President Trump's misconduct.\n\nBut minimization is only half the strategy to protect Republican control of the White House. The other half is scandalization: an effort to create an air of nonstop scandal around previous Democratic presidents and presidential hopefuls, she contends.\n\nShe directly cites Schweizer's latest book Profiles in Corruption in an effort to build her case but appears to do the opposite, admitting that the investigative work — which contains a number of bombshells on top progressive leaders, candidates and non-candidates, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Mayor Eric Garcetti — provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, albeit with a dismissive tone.\n\nHemmer writes:\n\nThe Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer followed Clinton Cash, a book that helped spread the Uranium One conspiracy, with Secret Empires, which targeted Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. Mr. Schweizer's most recent book, Profiles in Corruption, provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, like the daft tidbit that Senator Elizabeth Warren's son-in-law produced a film with support from two Iranian organizations. The investors, Mr. Schweizer wrote, might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations — but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. It may not seem like much, but as the birtherism conspiracy shows, scandals have been rooted in less.\n\nHowever, Hemmer's attempt to equate Schweizer's book to wild conspiracy theories falls flat, as his work contains 1,126 endnotes with concrete evidence stemming from corporate and legal records, lobbyist disclosures, property records, White House visitor logs, tax liens, and federal bankruptcies, among other documents.\n\nBreitbart News has detailed several of the bombshell revelations featured in Schweizer's book, including Warren's son-in-law's ties to the Iranian regime via his production company, Tricolor Films.\n\nIn 2008, Warren's son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, produced a film called The Song of Sparrows, which was directed by Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi. As Schweizer discovered, the movie's chief investors were funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government.\n\nAs Profiles in Corruption details:\n\nThe full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.\n\nBreitbart News broke down the revelation further:\n\nThe Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book. Another event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people. Schweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage. He writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.\n\nThe revelation is just one of many on Warren, as well as the other prolific progressives featured in the book, as the Hemmer acknowledges in her op-ed for the Times.\n\nI think there's a lot of things about Elizabeth Warren that are troubling, about how she was actually a government consultant in the 1990s rewriting bankruptcy laws, and in a typical Washington move, she took that position and cashed in, Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News's Special Report.\n\nShe basically went to corporations and said, I will consult for you and advise you in how to use the law that I wrote to your maximum advantage, he added.\n\nProfiles in Corruption also contains a number of detailed discoveries regarding the Biden 5, including how James Biden's firm received $1.5 billion in government contracts, despite having no experience, as well as Frank Biden's connection to projects receiving millions in taxpayer loans during the Obama administration. It also examines Hunter Biden's firms scoring business deals with people and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, as well as revelations on the former vice president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, purportedly directing $2.5 million from Citizens for Biden and Biden for President Inc. to her own contracting firm during her brother's last presidential bid in 2008.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for forthcoming reports from Profiles in Corruption.
The New York state legislature has passed a new law allocating up to $5 million in tax credits meant to encourage operators of a qualified film production company to hire women and people of color as TV writers and directors.\n\nSenate Bill S4999D passed 38 to 24 on Wednesday and adds an additional $5 million in tax incentives on top of New York's existing budget allotment of $420 million in TV and film tax credits.\n\nPeople in the TV industry have understood for years that enhancing the diversity of writing and directing improves the stories that appear onscreen, Writers Guild of America, East executive director Lowell Peterson said, according to Deadline. The missing link for policymakers has been putting money at the point of hire, and this legislation is an important step in that direction.\n\nThe bill had received support from the Directors Guild of America, whose Eastern executive director, Neil Dudich, said, For years the DGA has pushed the industry to change their imbalanced hiring practices — so that talent, and talent alone, is the defining factor.\n\nBy encouraging studios, networks and producers to discover the talented New York TV directors and writers that are out there in abundance, this bill can be a meaningful step forward in establishing a level playing field for all, Dudich added.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow appropriation of the new funding.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
On Thursday Senate Republicans introduced a measure that would ban organizations from the use of taxpayer funds to promote or refer girls and women for abortions abroad.\n\nThe legislation, known as the American Values Act, is in response to President Joe Biden's executive order revoking the Mexico City Policy, which the Trump administration expanded to prohibit organizations that receive U.S. health assistance funding from promoting or performing abortions overseas as a method of family planning.\n\nBiden signed the executive order despite consistent polling that shows Americans share bipartisan unity on barring taxpayer funding of abortion both within the United States and abroad.\n\nSens. Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the measure that seeks to permanently enact and expand existing prohibitions on the use of U.S. foreign assistance to pay for the performance or promotion of abortion services overseas, a joint press release stated.\n\nRisch said in the statement that pro-abortion groups have set their sights on exploiting loopholes and even overturning the long-standing pro-life provisions of law that have provided a solid foundation for values-based U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nIt is time for Congress to take decisive action and eliminate any ambiguity about how these provisions are meant to be applied, and so I'm proud to introduce the American Values Act to make them permanent in U.S. law, he added.\n\nU.S. foreign assistance is a critical tool of our national security and should not, in any way, go towards abortion or the promotion of abortion overseas, Rubio said.\n\nThe progressive left is working to enact their agenda at every possible opportunity, Young said, adding pro-abortion groups are hard at work trying to hijack those tax dollars not to protect our nation, but to perform or promote abortions around the world.\n\nThe legislation would permanently enact restrictions on the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for the promotion or performance of abortions, forced sterilizations, or biomedical research related to abortions.\n\nPaul also reintroduced two pro-life bills that seek to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception:\n\nThe proper role of government is to ensure that individual rights are protected, the most basic of which is the right to life. Sen @RandPaul introduces two pro-life bills, aiming to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception.https://t.co/4wrANMN7ns — March for Life (@March_for_Life) February 3, 2021\n\nAbortion providers like Planned Parenthood will tell you differently, but every single life matters, including the unborn, Paul said in a statement. I was proud to force the Senate to vote on defunding this organization. Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb.
Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding the potential for a new gun control debate in Congress after the tragedy in Las Vegas, President Trump's tax reform plan, and the federal response to Puerto Rico.\n\nSaid Norman of events in Las Vegas, For this to happen just shows the issues this country has.\n\nTo say that guns ought to be more regulated is just the wrong way, he continued, Now, what ought to be the topic of discussion is the tragedy that took place and how we can help to get God back into the mainstream of public life and it was absent in the killer and anyone that tries to make political hay, again, by talking about gun control, is backward in my opinion.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Marc Short, the former top aide to the Koch brothers who is the President's liaison to Congress, will leave as early as this summer, says the Wall Street Journal.\n\nShort is also complaining that he cannot get Trump's agenda endorsed by Congres, lamenting to colleagues the 'diminishing returns' of [his] pushing President Donald Trump's agenda through the Republican-controlled Congress as the midterm elections approach, according to people familiar with the conversations, says the WSJ report.\n\nShort's exit and replacement are important, partly because he is widely regarded as a champion for the GOP establishment's priorities, but not for the President's populist priorities, such as funding for a border wall.\n\nShort is a former top manager for the business donors in the Koch brothers' political network, and he also worked for Vice-President Mike Pence who did not have a populist record before 2016.\n\nShort played a leading role in persuading Congress to pass the December 2017 tax cuts.\n\nSince then, Trump's focus and agenda has turned to more populist priorities, such as a reduction in immigration numbers. The reductions will pressure companies to raise wages and develop labor-saving, higher-productivity machinery, so they are loudly opposed by the GOP donors. Short failed to get Trump's populist immigration policy and border-wall funded in the 2017 and 2018 omnibus bills, or getting Trump's immigration policy approved by the Senate in a February 2018 debate.\n\nThe WSJ reports:\n\nMr. Short's tenure has been marked by ups and downs, reflecting the Trump administration's legislative record. The main legislative accomplishment so far has been the tax package that Republicans approved in December, although some inside the White House have argued that Mr. Cohn and his team deserved much of the credit. But the White House was unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has abandoned its push for an infrastructure spending package, and has been unable to find consensus within the Republican Party on an immigration overhaul.\n\nShort has played a lower-profile role in the House debate over immigration reform and amnesty.
Left-wing filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said in a social media post Friday that furloughed federal workers should start a mass uprising and hound Mitch McConnell over the government shutdown.\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel, Michael Moore said. A human 'wall' at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I'd join that!\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel.

That is the work of cowards, he said.\n\nMore recently, the Bowling for Columbine creator declared that the GOP tax cut in 2017 was like an act of terror.\n\nAll the Republicans in that photo you showed standing there on the steps with him a year ago today all looking so slap happy and ah, remember it's not just Trump, all of the Republicans, all of them, nobody has had the courage to stand up and say this is wrong, this is un-American, he said.\n\nThis hurts this country. This is— this tax cut in a sense an act of terror because it's going to make the people who are already struggling to get by that much harder to get by.
California is the second-most expensive state to own a car, when adding in the purchase price, taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs — and Governor Jerry Brown is looking to regain the top crown.\n\nA new study from the personal finance website Go Banking Rates, reveals that the average additional costs per year to buy a new car and operate it for three years can vary by as much as $2,406 a year, depending on the residence of the consumer.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in America is about $33,543. But there are also six other factors that Kelly Blue Book evaluates to determine the true cost of owning and operating a vehicle in its first three years. Those costs include: sales tax, title fees, registration fees, average annual insurance premiums, annual gas expenses and average maintenance and repair costs. For a three-year period, the average additional cost per year to owning a car in the U.S. can vary by as much as about $3,742 a year.\n\nCalifornia has a well-earned reputation as Taxifornia. Consumers in the Golden State will pay an average of $4,817 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years\n\nBut Michigan is even worse than California, because the state has the highest insurance premium costs in the nation. A Michigander will pay an average of $5,105 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years.\n\nThe cheapest place to own a new car in its first three years is the Live Free or Die state of New Hampshire, where the annual cost is about $2,699. Keeping with its moto, New Hampshire does not impose a sales tax on vehicle purchases and has some of the lowest insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs in the nation.\n\nSacramento politicians will probably review this story and be appalled that they are not the national leader in cost.\n\nBut as Breitbart News reported, California Governor Brown is already claiming that the Golden State has a $59 billion backlog of maintenance needs on state highways and bridges. He has recently argued: We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads.\n\nThere is little opportunity to raise taxes at the pump, since Californians already pay the highest gasoline tax rate in America at 70.87 cents a gallon. Consequently, Brown has set-up a 15-member commission to study replacing the gas tax with an even more expensive road usage charge.\n\nBreitbart News estimates that the new roadway scheme would cost each California driver about $350 more per year. That would be more than sufficient for the state to regain its title as the most expensive state to operate a car.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday, where he declared the country open for business while criticizing the policies and corruption of previous socialist administrations.\n\nIn what proved to be a short keynote address, the Brazilian leader made a pitch designed to excite foreign investors by promising to reduce the heavy hand of the state after years of sluggish growth and an economic crisis that saw skyrocketing unemployment and extensive civil unrest.\n\nI took office amid a great ethical, moral, and economic crisis, he declared. I want to introduce to all of you the new Brazil we are building. We are committed to changing our history.\n\nWe will work to lower the tax burden, streamline rules and make life easier for those who want to produce and do business as entrepreneurs, invest and create jobs, he continued. We shall work to foster economic stability while respecting and honoring contracts … and balancing government accounts. Bolsonaro also spoke of his country's extraordinary natural beauty and declared it his mission to make progress in harmonizing environmental preservation and biodiversity, with much needed economic development. The 63-year-old former army captain also took aim at the left-wing governments that have dominated Latin America over the past two decades but have failed to keep power in recent years with the election of right-leaning governments in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Paraguay. We do not want to have a Bolivarian type of Latin America, as was the case in Brazil under previous administrations, he said. I believe that this new wave of interacting with South American countries has had a contagion effect – more center, center-right leaders have been successfully elected in these neighboring countries. I believe this is a clear cut response indicating that the left wing will not prevail in that region, which is a very good development in my view, not only for Latin America but for the rest of the world, he continued. Left-wing regimes continue to prevail in neighboring Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba, all of which Bolsonaro has pledged to push back against by forming a global coalition against communism. Bolsonaro's speech was written and revised by his economy minister, Paulo Guedes, a U.S.-educated free marketeer. It reportedly aimed to give the broadest message possible of the new Brazil that is presenting itself, with our arrival in power. The trip to Switzerland was Bolsonaro's first as the Brazilian leader. U.S. officials have previously indicated that he would visit Washington early in 2019 for a meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The European Union Capital of Culture competition has rejected the city of Székesfehérvár after claiming a video presented by the city's mayor showed the city to be too white and Christian.\n\nSzékesfehérvár, which was competing with several other Hungarian cities in the contest, presented a short video to the judges at the political bloc showing why the city should be shortlisted for the project.\n\nAccording to Székesfehérvár mayor András Cser-Palkovics, the committee who watched the film dismissed it as a propaganda film of white Christian Europe.\n\nMr Cser-Palkovics congratulated the three cities that had been shortlisted for the project but said that one of the EU experts said his city's video was a propaganda film of white Christian Europe, everyone is white, happy, dancing in the streets.\n\n'Accept the Will of the People on Migration, Culture, or Hit the Road': Orbán Tells Europe's Leaders\n\nhttps://t.co/bmp36tEsOy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2017\n\nThe mayor claimed that one of the panel, a Belgian politician, objected to the identity of the application based on the Greek, Roman, and Christian-Jewish cultures.\n\nIn the context of the applications, almost nothing was done, they did not deal with sustainability, funding, and did not deal with programs or investments, but only with daily political and ideological accusations. Just because we take pride in our cultural values. The cross is not only a religious but also a cultural value, and gives it the diversity that makes us proud of Europe, he added.\n\nThe European Capitals of Culture initiative, started in 1985, is touted as promoting the diversity of Europe by highlighting different cities across the continent in an effort to promote a European identity.\n\n'Hungary First': Orbán Vows to 'Fight Those Who Want to Change the Christian Identity of Europe' https://t.co/It6BWyPxDo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2018\n\nThe rejection for being too white echoes a movement across the western world to promote diversity. This has been slammed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who recently called for a patriotic alliance to combat advocates of mass migration and globalism.\n\nThe Orban government has laid much of the blame for the promotion of 'diversity', open borders, and mass migration on left-wing billionaire George Soros and his massive network of NGOs.\n\nThe Hungarian government recently passed a new law that would implement a new tax on NGOs assisting mass migration, which would be used to further reinforce the Hungarian border.\n\nOrban has also been a champion of traditional European culture, remarking back in November that governments should be dedicated to Christian values.
Forbes deleted an article this week about closing public libraries in favor of buying books on Amazon after it sparked a backlash online.\n\nThe article, which was written by Long Island University economist Panos Mourdoukoutas, was entitled Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money. The article argued that Amazon could fill the role of local libraries by replacing them with its own bookstores.\n\nAmazon should open their own bookstores in all local communities. They can replace local libraries and save taxpayers lots of money, while enhancing the value of their stock, Mourdoukoutas wrote.\n\nLibraries slowly began to service the local community more, he added. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they aren't for free. Homeowners have to be financed by taxpayers in form of a 'library tax.' It is usually added to school taxes, which in some communities are already high.\n\nThe article sparked an immediate backlash and Forbes promptly removed it from their site. In a statement, a Forbes spokesperson said that the article was removed because it was outside of the contributor's area of expertise.\n\nForbes advocates spirited dialogue on a range of topics, including those that often take a contrarian view, the spokesperson said. Libraries play an important role in our society. This article was outside of this contributor's specific area of expertise, and has since been removed.\n\nAngry tweets responding to the article's author garnered thousands of likes on Twitter.\n\nI'm a librarian and this is actually the worst fucking idea ever. Libraries by Amazon would eliminate the most important function libraries have—as a socialized daytime service to cash-poor and working class people left behind by digital advances. https://t.co/YqxLgAZQm6 — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nAs they are today, libraries are mostly used by folks who don't (or who are denied access to) daytime economies, particularly homeless/houseless folks. There is NO WAY that Amazon libraries would continue to serve homeless/houseless people in this way. — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nLibraries aren't just museums for books, people. Real life people come there for information on services to try to often save their lives. Info on doctors, domestic violence shelters, help to get jobs. Stop funding everything that rich folk want and leave libraries the fuck alone — jamey hatley (@jameyhatley) July 22, 2018\n\nIt is unclear why Mourdoukoutas' article and the resulting backlash prompted Forbes to act so quickly. In the age of Internet journalism, bad opinions are often met with swift and persuasive rebuttals. Disagreements are best had when each party has an opportunity to express their opinion. Moreover, it's important that no one fears that the mere expression of their opinion will result in brigading and censoring of their words.\n\nCensorship issues aside, many critics have pointed out that the closure of public libraries would have the strongest impact on low-income families. Paul Guequierre, director of communications for the Urban Libraries Council, explained why this decision would hit low-income Americans the hardest. The communities that would be affected the most would likely be low-income people, immigrants, and, really, the most marginalized among us, he said. [People] don't have to buy a cup of coffee at the library.\n\nAn archived version of the original Forbes article can be read here.
Despite many cities hosting the Olympics facing bankruptcy in the aftermath, a new study by Beacon Economics LLC and UC Riverside predicts that the Los Angeles area would see an $9.5 billion economic boost and generate $4.4 billion in worker earnings if the city is awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nLos Angeles, Paris and Budapest are the finalists to be awarded the 2024 Olympic Summer Games. The winning city will be picked in September, supposedly based on evaluations of the competing cities' vision, governance, games delivery and venue funding.\n\nL.A.'s bid is uniquely structured compared to the other finalist cities, because LA claims it does not need to build any new permanent venues. LA 2024 intends to rely solely on access to existing sports complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.\n\nThe economic impact study was conducted by the UC Riverside's School of Business Center for Economic Forecasting and Development to evaluate the viability of the L.A. 2024 Olympic Bid Committee (L.A. 2024) final proposal. According to their analysis, the City of Los Angeles will not lose money hosting the games and will generate additional tax revenues of between $152 million and $167 million, mostly from hotel transient occupancy taxes and incremental sales tax revenues.\n\nThe increase in economic output from the games will also generate the equivalent amount of between 74,308 and 79,307 full-time jobs.\n\nBut the City of Los Angeles will still be at risk for up to $6 billion in spending necessary to host the games. L.A. 2024 estimates it will make a surplus by selling $1.3 to $1.5 billion of Olympics and Paralympic Games tickets; plus taking in $4.8 billion in advertising and sponsorship revenue.\n\nThe competition to host an Olympic games comes after the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympic Summer Games that cost about Brazil about $4.6 billion to host and was filled with daily tales of corruption. Ten days after the final ceremonies, Brazil's Senate convicted impeached President Dilma Rousseff by a vote of 61-20 for illegally using money from state banks to bankroll public spending on the Olympics and other boondoggles.\n\nThe 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics was predicted to cost to cost the host $125 million. When challenged on the cost, Mayor Jean Drapeau — famously confident in his management capabilities — declared: The Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby. The economic flop left Montreal saddled with $1.5 billion in debt.\n\nAfter the estimated cost of hosting the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics doubled to over $11 billion, Greece had to admit to the European Commission that it was entering a public debt crisis. Thirteen years later, Greece is still an economic basket case.\n\nA confident Los Angeles Eric Garcetti claimed as the Rio Olympic scandal was raging in August: In 1984, Los Angeles showed the world that a responsibly managed Olympic Games could add billions of dollars to the local economy and bring progress that could be felt for decades to come — and we're ready to do that again in 2024.
The Ugandan military's heavy presence in the national capital, Kampala, ahead of the country's general election on Thursday evoked a tense, war-like atmosphere, Ugandan human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo told Deutsche Welle (DW) on Wednesday.\n\nIt doesn't feel as though the country is going into an election, Opiyo told the German state broadcaster.\n\nIt feels as though the country is at war, he said, describing scores of armored vehicles with mounted guns … patrolling the capital.\n\nOpiyo recently served jail time in Uganda after facing charges of money laundering and is currently out on bail. The human rights lawyer described the government's charges against him to DW as a continuation of a pattern targeting civil society leaders.\n\nOpiyo said many people he knew in Uganda sent their families out of the country or to the countryside after Uganda's army deployed forces to maintain order in the capital this week.\n\nIn addition to increasing security in Kampala, the Ugandan federal government has shut down access to most social media platforms used in the country ahead of its January 14 general election.\n\nThe government has closed social media, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said in a national address on January 12.\n\nMuseveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, accused U.S.-owned Facebook and alleged foreign actors of arrogance in his speech after Facebook removed Ugandan accounts linked to his reelection campaign on January 11. The accounts were allegedly pretending to be independent supporters of Museveni.\n\nThis is unfortunate but it is unavoidable, the Ugandan president said of the social media blockage.\n\nThere is no way anybody can come around and play with our country, to decide who is good, who is bad. We cannot accept that, Museveni said, adding that he cannot tolerate this arrogance.\n\nThe social media shutdown has hindered journalists' efforts to report on Uganda's voting process on election day.\n\nMuseveni in 2018 criticized social media platforms for promoting allegedly false information in Uganda, claiming young people spent too much time on messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Later that year, Uganda's government imposed a $0.05 tax on social media usage in the country. Since then, many Ugandans have accessed the internet via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to side-step the tax.\n\n[T]hose who are already using VPNs are able to easily get around this latest social media blackout, DW noted on Wednesday.\n\nSince [Monday], we have been having a problem with the internet, especially those people who are using [the social media tax]. They have found it so challenging but with people who had already downloaded VPN, they are okay, Kampala resident Gerald Sengelo told the broadcaster.\n\nUganda is one of 15 African countries to restrict social media access during elections since 2015, according to data from the privacy protection company Surfshark.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's (D) push to ban private gun sales was defeated in the Virginia Senate Courts of Justice Committee Monday morning.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that Second Amendment supporters held a Monday morning rally in Capitol Square while Northam planned speak to gun control supporters mid-afternoon.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Northam was pushing a ban on private gun sales by seeking a requirement that all gun sales, retail or private, be performed via a background check. This would have required law-abiding Virginians to seek out a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) to do a background check if a private citizen was selling a gun to a neighbor, a lifelong friend, or a co-worker.\n\nColorado already has a similar law and charges a fee every time a background check is performed. In the end, the fee is like a gun tax that raises the sale price for each gun sold without offering any substantial hindrance to high profile attacks in return. High profile attackers almost always acquire their guns via background checks, which is easy to do if one has avoided accumulating a criminal history.\n\nBackground checks look backward, as the name suggests, and where there is no criminal history there is no reason to prevent a gun sale. Because of this, the attackers who struck the Texas church (November 5, 2017), Las Vegas concert (October 1, 2017), Orlando Pulse (June 12, 2016), Alexandria baseball practice (June 14, 2017), Aurora movie theater (July 20, 2012), and Virginia Tech (April 16, 2007) all passed background checks for their guns.\n\nNortham's push to allow localities to ban firearms at permitted events was also defeated in committee.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and the 'Remain' campaign are only targeting one specific demographic to register to vote in Britain's referendum on the European Union (EU), Breitbart London can reveal.\n\nLast week, Breitbart London alleged that the government was spending copious amounts of tax payer money trying to get young people to vote in the referendum, considering they are more naturally likely to vote 'Remain'.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/740269678711431168\n\nDespite the dismissive messages from Remain campaigners, Breitbart London can reveal that in fact, Mr. Cameron is only targeting 18-35-year-olds exclusively on Facebook in order to get a huge voter registration bump in favour of the outcome he prefers: a vote to stay in the EU.\n\nFacebook sponsored adverts, which have accounted for a huge percentage of those registering to vote on the UK government website, reveal that Mr. Cameron is using his own tax payer funded Facebook page to target younger voters.\n\nThis means Mr. Cameron, his government, and the Remain campaign are not only ignoring anyone older than 35, but that their claim to simply be trying to register as many people to vote as possible is a verifiable lie.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook prompted Register to vote.\n\nMaybe coincidence, but here's how voter reg stats changed. #euref pic.twitter.com/ZjOdHfbv3l — dan barker (@danbarker) June 5, 2016\n\nThe screenshot proving the claim reveals: You're seeing this advert because David Cameron wants to reach people aged 18 to 35 who are in England. This is based on things like your Facebook profile information and your Internet connection.\n\nThe ad itself reads: Deadline Extended: You can register to vote until midnight tonight.\n\nThe link takes people to the UK government website which has seen a 2.5 million surge in voter registrations in the past 30 days – higher than at any previous General Election.\n\nAnd while no one has said that people should not register to vote of their own accord, Remain campaigners are hiding behind their extra government funding and the targeted ads by attacking Leave campaigners as being anti-democracy.\n\nA spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign told Breitbart London: The motives behind extending the deadline were already questionable, but to spend tax payers' money in this period targeting young people specifically is beyond contempt. It shows you the depths dodgy Dave and the Remaniacs will go to stitch up the vote.\n\nTraditionally, younger voters are more inclined to vote to Remain in the European Union than leave. Recent YouGov polling reveals that those under the age of 24 are likely to vote 'Remain' by 64 per cent to 18 per cent, with 5 per cent saying they would not vote, and 13 per cent remaining undecided.\n\nOf the age group 25-49, Remain has the backing of 44 per cent of voters, with just 35 per cent saying they'd vote to leave (six per cent would not vote, and 14 per cent are undecided).\n\nThe British government has undertaken a massive voter registration campaign, as has the Labour Party and a number of left-wing, pro-EU outfits such as the BBC, Facebook, local councils, Bite the Ballot, 38 Degrees, the Green Party, and more.\n\nQuestions will now be asked as to why the government is only using tax payer money to target one demographic that benefits the Remain campaign.\n\nCampaigners have told Breitbart London they expect Members of Parliament to demand to know how much the government has spent on total on this blitz. The figure is expected to stretch into the millions of pounds.\n\nFollow Raheem Kassam for more Brexit breaking news
Economist and CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow praised the GOP's tax legislation Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable, saying he has never seen anything like the response by major corporations to increase wages, bonuses or increasing investments.\n\n[W]e are on the front end of a major business investment boom. And that boom is going to carry economic growth faster, it's going to create more jobs, it's going to create more wages, Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.\n\nHe added, The deficit is going to be much lower. This thing is going to pay for itself inside of a couple of years. … This will enhance America's influence overseas because of our booming economy.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) — Joe Biden has called for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign to disown what he calls doctored video that some Sanders supporters say shows the former vice president endorsing Republican calls to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThere's a little doctored video going around … put out by one of Bernie's people, Biden told supporters Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, referring to a 2018 speech in which Biden discussed then-House Speaker Paul Ryan saying rising deficit demanded action on the popular entitlement programs.\n\nI'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it, Biden continued, pointing to his 2020 campaign proposals designed to shore up Social Security. But they haven't done it yet.\n\nThe video in question, circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser, does not appear to be altered. But the short clip omits Biden's larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. A separate Sanders' adviser included a transcript of Biden's remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a U.S. senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.\n\nThe 2020 campaign flap highlights long-standing philosophical fissures between the progressive Sanders, who has spent decades arguing for a massive expansion of the federal government, and the more centrist Biden. Those differences have come to the forefront as Biden and Sanders are bunched with Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren atop early state polls weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nResponding to Biden's remarks Saturday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.\n\nThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security — he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Shakir said in a statement. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 tweet, Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels wrote that it is soul-wrenching to have heard Biden say 'Ryan was correct.' He attached a 20-second video clip taken from an April 2018 speech Biden delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Biden continued, leaning into the microphone. Social Security and Medicare … That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.\n\nIt was part of a broader speech in which Biden outlined his economic vision. He previewed his 2020 campaign emphasis on the middle-class, but declared that billionaires are not the problem, an implicit contrast with progressives. The statement that Gunnels highlighted reflects a common Biden argument from the 2020 campaign: that Republicans pushed a tax cut whose benefits are tilted to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, knowing it would balloon the deficits, so the GOP could then justify cutting Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhat I'd do is I make sure that we expand Social Security coverage, Biden insisted Friday when a voter in Iowa asked him about the program.\n\nBiden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden — and many other Democrats — propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.\n\nSanders' camp, meanwhile, maintains that Biden's history is more important than his current proposals. Another of their favorite video clips shows then-Sen. Biden, in the first years after Republicans' 1994 midterm election romp, calling for a more austere approach. When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security, as well, Biden said at the time. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. … And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n\nJust as the Biden campaign argues that Republicans would lambaste the Vermont senator as a socialist if he wins the Democratic nomination, Sanders' backers retort that Trump would use the same video clips they cite to harm Biden with older voters who will prove critical in battleground states in November.
TEL AVIV – Fires in nine localities across Israel have been deemed acts of arson and possibly terrorism, rendering victims eligible to receive compensation from state emergency funds for victims of terror.\n\nThe Israel Tax Authority said on Tuesday that fires in nine cities and settlements occurring at specific times were started by arsonists. These include Haifa, where roughly 500 homes were burnt down, and several West Bank settlements.\n\nFrom information received by the Tax Authority, the Israel Police and the Fire and Rescue Services commission, it has been determined that the fires in these locations were caused by intentional arson with reasonable suspicion of terrorist activities, a statement from the tax authority noted.\n\nLosses caused by wildfires and other natural disasters would usually only be covered by private insurance. In these nine cases, financial losses would be considered war damages.\n\nSeveral dozen of the 1,773 fires firefighters battled last week are suspected to have been started by arsonists, police said. Six teenagers from the Arab-Israeli village of Jadeidi-Makr who were arrested last week on suspicion of setting a nearby forest on fire were denied bail on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, police announced that a 28-year-old Arab-Israeli man from the northern city of Umm al-Fahm is to be indicted for arson.\n\nKnesset members have been calling for the government to compensate all victims of the fire in full, regardless of whether or not the losses were the result of arson. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) announced that NIS 2,500 ($650) will be awarded to every person who is unable to return home due to damages.\n\nSome 75,000 people were forced to flee their homes since the wildfires started last Tuesday, destroying 32,000 acres of land. Most have been cleared to return home but damages are estimated to reach hundreds of millions shekels.
Employees of tech companies in San Francisco, California, can't leave the city fast enough, fleeing for the potential tech hubs of tomorrow such as Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. One former San Francisco exec said: what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez has been fielding inquiries from top executives in the tech world, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nThe report added that the mayor has also met with former Google Chairman and Clinton lackey Eric Schmidt, and the chairman of Palantir, Peter Thiel, among others.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that a big part of the reason why they are moving is that they feel that there is an inhospitable environment for regulation and taxation, said Suarez.\n\nMiami is not the only city experiencing this type of migration, as tech employees from San Francisco are fleeing to other states offering them better opportunities as well.\n\nTech workers living in San Francisco had once believed that the high rent, high taxes, long commute to work, and rude neighbors were worth it if they could live in the epicenter of a boom that was changing the world, reported SFGATE.\n\nBut now, in the wake of the pandemic, tech workers can't flee the city fast enough, as spending months working remotely in other towns has shown them that the quality of life can be higher elsewhere.\n\nTech workers and their bosses realized they might not need all the perks and after-work schmooze events. But maybe they needed elbow room and a yard for the new puppy. A place to put the Peloton. A top public school, noted SFGATE.\n\nAnd so they fled to more affordable places, like Georgia, and states with no income taxes, like Texas and Florida. The report added that the number one choice of relocation for people leaving San Francisco is Austin, Texas.\n\nJohn Gardner, the founder and CEO of the remote personal training startup Kickoff — who fled San Francisco for Miami Beach — told SFGATE that he can't help but wonder, what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nJustin Kan, who co-founded Twitch, tweeted to his followers in August last year, asking them where he should move.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? asked Kan.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? — Justin Kan (@justinkan) August 17, 2020\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society, responded Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of software company Palantir.\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society. — Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) August 17, 2020\n\nThe report added that there are currently 33,000 members in a Facebook group called Leaving California, as well as 51,000 members in its sister group, Life After California. In the groups, people share photos of moving trucks, and links to property listings in new cities.\n\nWhen people decide to leave San Francisco, they usually don't know where they want to go, they just want to go, said Terry Gilliam, the founder of both Facebook groups.\n\nBear Kittay, the co-founder Good Money, echoed those sentiments, and even acknowledged that some people may find themselves relocating to a place that is more conservative.\n\nThe things that make this city ill are not within my control to change, said Kittay of San Francisco.\n\nA lot of people are choosing to go to places where there's opportunity, he added. And maybe it's a place that is more conservative and there can be an integration of dialogue.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently promised on social media that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly while announcing the same day that Tesla will no longer be producing certain popular Model S vehicles.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly. Replying to a tweet in which one Twitter user jokingly implied that Tesla vehicles in the year 2022 will look something like a flying DeLorean car from Back to the Future, Musk stated that the new Roadster will actually do something like this.\n\nThe new Roadster will actually do something like this https://t.co/fIsTAYa4x8 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nPopular YouTube tech reviewer and Tesla owner Marques Brownlee (known by his YouTube handle of MKBHD) replied to Musk's tweet saying that he feels as if Musk wasn't joking in his initial tweet and actually believes that Tesla Roadsters will be flying in 2022. Musk replied that he was indeed serious:\n\nI'm not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBrownlee did not appear skeptical of Musk's claim and instead stated that he loved the idea, Musk then said that one of the benefits of this idea is that the Roadster could accelerate at the limit of human endurance.\n\nPlus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nWhen asked if the car would be able to drive a quarter of a mile in less than eight seconds, Musk replied: No problem.\n\nNo problem — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBut a few hours later, Musk returned to Earth when tweeted that Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the popular 75 kWh battery version of their Model S and Model X vehicles, with the 100 kWh battery version becoming the standard model:\n\nStarting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S & X. If you'd like that version, please order by Sunday night at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nRecently, John Engle, President of Almington Capital, noted that as Tesla manages to fix some of its production issues, resulting in a 13 percent rise in Model 3 car deliveries in the fourth quarter, the company now faces a new challenge — lack of demand. While Tesla has still failed to meet its previously projected production goal of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week, their delivery of 63,150 Model 3 vehicles in the fourth quarter was a solid improvement. But as the company closes up a supposed backlog of 450,000 vehicles, cracks are beginning to appear.\n\nAccording to what Engle says are Tesla's reported numbers, approximately 7,000 Model 3 vehicles are being kept in storage and without buyers. This amounts for approximately two weeks worth of vehicles at Tesla's current production rate. Combined with the $2,000 price slash across all of the company's vehicles in an attempt to offset the phase-out of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle owners, and a general drop in Model 3 sales, it's understandable why many investors believe that the coming year will show a lack of demand for Tesla's vehicles. Even as the company plans to expand their European sales, Goldman Sachs sees an imminent lull in demand.
A new report on the state of the public school systems in Obama's home state of Illinois finds they are $20 billion in debt with no end in sight to the growing budget failure.\n\nAccording to a new review by the Chicago Tribune, the massive debt isn't necessarily crushing the state's schools, because the state legislature has passed laws to give schools the power to keep borrowing no matter what, so there is no incentive for the schools to mind budgets. According to the paper, the debt has accrued due to special deals in Springfield that have given districts exemptions so they can keep borrowing beyond limits set by law.\n\nThe Tribune found the state's schools are collectively in enough debt to amount to about $10,000 for each Pre-K to 12th-grade public school student in the state.\n\nAll the borrowing is a drain on taxpayers who have to repay the debt, the paper noted, as well as school budgets that must steer billions of dollars annually to principal and interest payments — money that could be targeted to classrooms. In some districts, more local tax money is collected for debt payments than for teacher salaries and student instruction.\n\nOne public schools official told the paper that if a school in the state exceeds its limits nothing happens, so they just keep borrowing or they go to their representatives and get special set-asides or borrowing deals that sit outside their limits.\n\nAs an example, the paper revealed that one district supposedly had a debt limit of $16 million but last year reached $50 million, as there was no legal curb on its spending.\n\nThe problem isn't just laid at the doorstep of state Democrats, either, as one bill in the state legislature filed by Republican House Leader Tom Cross allowed a district near his home to float $450 million in bonds without having the debt count toward its borrowing limit.\n\nAnother district, Ford Heights District 169, borrowed a whopping ten times more than its supposed borrowing limit.\n\nOf the nearly $20 billion in debt statewide, the Chicago Public Schools account for a huge chunk totaling at least $6.3 billion in overages.\n\nYet, despite the massive overspending, teachers unions in many districts want more. Recently the Chicago Teachers Union launched an illegal one-day strike demanding raises and higher spending in the Windy City.\n\nThe strike was such an outrage to city officials that Chicago Public Schools chief Forrest Claypool vowed teachers would not be paid for missing the school day.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
An amnesty would generate more taxes for the government and more cheap workers for businesses, according to a pitch from a construction executive and various Koch network activists that sidelines the interests of American employees.\n\nStan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, is pushing the ID & Tax Proposal amnesty:\n\nLet's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.\n\nThe fix is an adult DACA: We know it works because it works for 800,000 people, said Marek, who has long complained about the No-match letters.\n\nThis is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. By legalizing the illegal immigrants, the benefit to employers is greater because there's more of the cost of [cheap labor] immigration that taxpayers can be forced to bear.\n\nMarek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.\n\nThe corporate demand to hire illegal migrants instead of Americans comes amid a housing boom that could otherwise help pull many sidelined Americans back into jobs and the middle-class. But Marek's video excludes any talk about Americans' current or future role in their own nation's economy.\n\nThe children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.\n\nSeveral investor-funded activists echoed Marek's call for cheap labor in the video.\n\nDeporting illegal migrants would be an economic tragedy, said Daniel Griswold, the immigration policy director at the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Think of the workplaces that would be disrupted, he lamented.\n\nBecause 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.\n\nPayan's call for endless visa worker inflows echoes the any willing worker plan pushed by President George W. Bush — and dodges the question of whether the United States should adopt a two-tier society of citizens exploiting powerless foreign workers.\n\nThe video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.\n\nThis video sympathy helped Marek and other speakers to offer progressives and government employees a share of the potential benefits from the mass amnesty of illegal migrants.\n\nWe think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.\n\nThe amnesty pitch was wrapped in a soft-focus video, which portrayed the illegals as the victims, even though the illegals voluntarily enter the United States, break laws, and extract wages away from Americans' labor market. For example, Marek offered sympathy for the poor migrants who accept low wage jobs from construction executives:\n\nThe jefes that run big crews, the labor brokers who violate every principle and law, yeah, they're making a lot of money. But if you take the typical worker out there walking on that truss, that are working as independent contractors, they're living in poverty, most of them. They don't have workman's comp, and if they get hurt most of them are going to just suck it up. If they get hurt, they're going to go to the ER [hospital emergency room]. And if they go to the ER, it's expensive and we have to pay for it.\n\nMarek and his allies repeatedly blamed Americans for not welcoming an uncapped inflow of migrants that would push the Americans out of jobs, cut their wages, spike their housing costs, and crowd their children's' schools.\n\nWe have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.\n\nThis is us who becomes the obstacle, said Robert Sanborn, president of Children at Risk. a Houston, Texas, advocacy group for migrants. I worry about all these kids [of illegal migrants] that could be tremendous economic assets for us … they're always going to be underperforming.\n\nOur legal immigration system has failed for years to keep up with the demand of our economy, said Ali Noorani, the president of the National Immigration Forum.Since there are very few legal pathways for people to enter the country, [migrants] make a decision to overstay a visa, to enter without inspection and hence, we're faced with this population of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe video ignored the impact of the cheap-labor migrant workforce on the employment and income of American workers. In 2018, Breitbart reported:\n\nBlaine Taylor, the whistleblower, said the construction industry in California once offered a starting wage of about $45 an hour in the late 1980s. Fast-forward to 2018 — nearly two decades into when illegal aliens began flooding the industry — he now says that wages have fallen by more than half, standing at just $11 an hour.\n\nTaylor continued:\n\nThe reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.\n\nMarek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the American labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of American workers, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nThere's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.\n\nIn a tight labor market, they still have market power [to demand higher wages]; With a globalized labor market, American workers lose that market power, he added.\n\nMany polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says the European Union needs to reform itself this year to be able to compete with big powers like China and the United States.\n\nMacron said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that more ambitious EU countries must be able to move toward more European integration, even if other European countries don't want to join in.\n\nHe said: The less ambitious should not block the more ambitious in the room.\n\nHe added that countries sharing the euro currency must be able to agree on a much stronger and much fair system. He said EU countries need to coordinate their tax policies because otherwise talents will disappear.
Swedish bank Handelsbanken says Sweden's economy has signs of weak growth and the unemployment rate has increased compared to other European Union member-states.\n\nHandelsbanken chief economist Christina Nyman stated in a press release that the Swedish economy grew by just one per cent in 2019, that she expected the economy would continue to perform poorly this year, and that unemployment would also continue to rise.\n\nSweden is the only country in the EU where unemployment has clearly increased in recent years, Nyman said.\n\nThe economist went on to say that the labour market in Sweden would likely be weaker than both the EU and United States averages in the coming year, and that predicted wage increases could lead to low inflation.\n\nWe believe that economic indicators will start to turn up during the year and that the Riksbank will therefore still leave interest rates unchanged at zero percent both this year and next year, she said.\n\nThe Swedish unemployment rate, according to newspaper Dagens Industri, is expected to sit at around 7.2 per cent this year and rise even further to 7.4 per cent in the following year.\n\nSwedish Municipalities Who Took in Too Many Migrants Face Service Cuts https://t.co/3ZnaxssAfY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 26, 2019\n\nSweden's unemployment rate shows a massive disparity when native Swedes are compared to foreign-born residents.\n\nA report released in October of last year showed that as many as 90 per cent of migrants who arrived during the height of the 2015 migrant crisis and received permanent residency were unemployed.\n\nAnother report from earlier this month revealed that in the 18 to 25 age bracket, close to half of Swedish debtors were migration-background young men.\n\nThe struggling economy has left many local governments in financial peril as costs for services for new migrants remain high and existing unemployed migrants do not add to the already strained tax base.\n\nEight out of ten municipalities will be forced to make serious cuts to local services as a result of mass migration and changing demographics.\n\nSweden: Around 90 Per Cent of 2015 Migrants with Residency Status Are Unemployed https://t.co/G4IhlnXBCx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019
A video of a father confronting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) about her plans to erase the bulk of student loan debt went viral on Thursday after he questioned the fairness of her proposal and added that those of us that did the right thing get screwed.\n\nA father confronted Warren during an event in Grimes, Iowa, on Monday about her plan to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt.\n\nI just wanted to ask one question. My daughter is getting out of school. I've saved all my money. She doesn't have any student loans. Am I going to get my money back? he asked.\n\nOf course not, Warren replied.\n\nSo you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed? he asked.\n\nMy buddy had fun, bought a car, and went on all the vacations, I saved my money. He makes more than I did. I worked a double shift, the man pressed before accusing Warren of not taking him seriously.\n\nYou're laughing at me, he said. Yeah that's exactly what you're doing. We did the right thing and we get screwed.\n\nI appreciate your time, Warren stated as he walked away:\n\nMy daughter is in school. I saved all my money just to pay student loans. Can I have my money back?@ewarren: Of course not So you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed?pic.twitter.com/EXoU2ci2Wt — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 23, 2020\n\nUnder Warren's plan, individuals with a household income of $100,000 or less could have $50,0000 in student debt erased. Those with a household income of up to $250,000 could also see some of their debt erased, but a lower amount.\n\nShe also vows to cancel the majority of student loan debt on day one of her presidency via executive action:\n\nWe have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I've already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I'll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately. https://t.co/bvhpuQmHH1 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 14, 2020\n\nWarren says it is nonsense to suggest that the U.S. cannot afford her proposal, contending that her Ultra-Millionaire Tax will cover the costly plan.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham‏ (R-SC) said if Republican legislators did not follow through with their promises they are dead.\n\nWhen asked if Congress was going to pass tax reform Graham‏ said, ‏If we don't we are dead.\n\nHe continued, If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace Obamacare then we're going to lose across the board the house in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell we know it. That is a symptom of a greater problem. If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.\n\nHe continued, Mitch McConnell is not our problem. Our problem that we promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and we failed. We promised to cut taxes, and we're yet to do it. If we're successful Mitch McConnell is fine if not we're all in trouble. We'll lose our majority, and I think President Trump will not get reelected.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Mike The Situation Sorrentino, of MTV's Jersey Shore fame, is facing up to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday.\n\nMarc Sorrentino, brother of The Situation, also pleaded guilty to aiding in the preparation of a fraudulent tax return and will face a maximum of three years. Five and three years are statutory maximum sentences; both men are likely to receive much less severe penalties.\n\n\n\nThe charges against the Sorrentinos stem from the concealment of cash receipts from businesses the brothers set up to monetize The Situation's fame. The bothers were alleged to have failed to report potentially millions of dollars of receipts, knowingly failing to file tax returns, and filing false tax returns and strategically depositing the cash to avoid oversight.\n\nAs we approach this year's filing season, today's guilty pleas should serve as a stark reminder to those who would attempt to defraud our nation's tax system, Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division's Newark Field Office, said in the DOJ press release accompanying the pleas. No matter what your stature is in our society, everyone is expected to play by the rules, and those who do not will be held accountable and brought to justice.\n\nAll of us are required by law to pay our fair share of taxes. Celebrity status does not provide a free pass from this obligation, the U.S. attorney supervising the prosecution, Craig Carpenito of the District of New Jersey, added.\n\n\n\nTheir accountant, Gregg Mark, already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government in 2015.\n\nThe plea agreement, which saw the brothers plead guilty to one felony charge each, avoided the much more serious charges detailed in the their 14-count indictment, including currency structuring (continually making deposits under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements) and conspiracy.\n\nThe Sorrentinos are scheduled to be sentenced April 25 before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton.
The GOP tax overhaul looks increasingly likely to win enough votes to pass in the Senate after Senator John McCain said he supports the bill.\n\nAfter careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMcCain also said he endorses the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate that is included in the Senate tax bill, describing the mandate as an onerous mandate.\n\nBy repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous that especially harms those from low-income brackets, McCain said.\n\nMcCain also said that while he takes seriously concerns some Senators have raised about the economy, it's clear this bill's net effect on our economy would be positive.\n\nMcCain's endorsement is a major milestone because it was his vote against the repeal of Obamacare that sunk the GOP bill this summer. His declaration of support narrows the range of issues that need to be resolved by GOP leaders to reach the fifty votes required to pass the measure (with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast the tie-breaking vote).\n\nThe list of GOP Senators whose votes are in doubt now includes just the deficit hawks Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the small business advocates Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, and healthcare holdout Susan Collins of Maine. Nearly all, however, have expressed confidence that their issues can be resolved in negotiations with Senate leaders.
The value of Tesla Inc. stock plunged by about $5.4 billion over a 48-hour period this week as the company declared a large quarterly loss and finally acknowleded that deliveries of its high-volume Model 3 will be delayed by at least 6 months.\n\nTesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.\n\nAlthough Tesla's $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts' estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.\n\nBreitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its all-time best quarter with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.\n\nBut Musk emphasized that through physics-first principles, Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by factors of 10 or even 100 times. He said Tesla's key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.\n\nWith investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla's stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.\n\nBut the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company's third quarter conference call that it is difficult to predict when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.\n\nMusk tried to reassure shareholders that he is leading from the front lines to battle production hell delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla's $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory's roof as a sign of his focus.\n\nMusk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company's largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.\n\nBut he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer's brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two Body in White (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky cold build line layout and quality testing at Tesla's factory.\n\nNiedermeyer added that disagreements between Tesla's designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order. The BIW vendor blamed Tesla's high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.\n\nIn another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic's Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply. Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.
With 2018 in the rear-view mirror, some of the world's largest, most influential, and most volatile states prepare to elect their heads of government this year. Below, five countries whose presidential races – or attempts at hosting presidential races – will help shape the political impact of 2019.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nThe government of Afghanistan confirmed this weekend that the 2019 presidential elections will occur on July 20, raising a host of questions regarding the nation's democratic norms and ability to maintain security for voters in light of ongoing, and increasingly frustrating, peace negotiations with the Taliban. The July date pushes the election back from April 20, the original election day; government officials cite security, operational, and technical related issues making that deadline impossible.\n\nAfghanistan will begin registering presidential candidates today, meaning a full list of the candidates is not yet available, though incumbent President Ashraf Ghani will likely appear on the ballot.\n\nWho wins the Afghan presidential election is less important than whether the country can pull off organizing a nationwide election without major intervention by the Taliban. The Taliban rejected yet another call for direct talks with Ghani's government this weekend, insisting that they had gained too much ground to bother entertaining Ghani. The Taliban has repeatedly rejected talks with Ghani because they consider themselves the legitimate government of Afghanistan and Ghani merely a puppet of the United States.\n\nU.S. peace talks with the Taliban could also endanger the election, as reports suggest that the Trump administration is seeking a FARC-like peace deal that would legitimize the Taliban as an Afghan political party. In the unlikely event that such a deal is signed before the election, there is a non-negligible possibility that the Taliban itself fields a presidential candidate.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria, Africa's largest economy, held its first successful democratic transfer of power in 2015, when incumbent Goodluck Jonathan lost to former dictator Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari won the presidency largely on his promise to eradicate the Boko Haram threat in northeastern Nigeria, a promise he has entirely failed to live up to despite repeatedly declaring victory against the terrorist group as early as December 2015.\n\nThe 2019 election is pivotal for the future of Nigeria not just because of the prolonged Boko Haram threat, but because it will be a test of whether the 2015 election was a mere fluke or whether Nigeria has fully embraced democratic institutions. Democratic traditions are built over time, and the lack of overt threat of a military takeover or coup d'etat bodes well for the state so far.\n\nDemocracy is so in demand in Nigeria that, by October, 79 political parties had registered to field candidates in the 2019 election. In the regional legislative elections, 89 parties registered to run candidates. Yet the frontrunners remain the candidate for the two major parties: Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The campaign has already turned bitter – Buhari's campaign is accusing Abubakar of having a sealed indictment against him for corruption in the United States, while Buhari has had to deny that he is a clone of himself deployed to replace the real, dead Buhari. According to some estimates, as Buhari kept some of his medical treatment for unspecified conditions a secret, he spent up to 15 percent of his term abroad receiving healthcare.\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina was the first major country in the Americas to turn rightward after the early 21st-century wave of leftist presidents took over the region – including the United States, as former Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri took over the country before President Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Macri won his election largely in response to the tremendous backlash against leftist predecessor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's ties to the Venezuelan dictatorship and Iran's Islamic theocracy in the aftermath of the suicide of the prosecutor investigating Iranian terrorism in Argentina, Alberto Nisman.\n\nDespite running as a pro-business candidate, Macri's biggest challenge in 2019 will be justifying the languishing status of his nation's economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently gave Argentina a $56 billion credit line to fix its recession, the largest ever, which only exacerbated concerns that the Argentine peso's value is about to plummet. The economic situation has deteriorated to a point that speculation has begun that Kirchner will attempt to reclaim the presidency from Macri despite an ongoing corruption investigation and the still-unresolved status of the Nisman murder.\n\nIt is impossible to fully assess the status of the Argentine election until candidates, Kirchner in particular, confirm their running status. Whoever confronts Macri, however, will have to navigate residual bitterness from the Kirchner presidency – and fear of becoming another Venezuela under yet more socialist rule – to adequately use Macri's woeful economy against him.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada's is not technically a presidential election, but the nation will choose its head of government in October 2019 through its parliamentary elections, granting the nation a chance to review the record of leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau will face off against Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, attempting to run on issues such as environmental regulation and regional trade.\n\nConservatives appear eager to discuss environmental regulation under Trudeau; this summer, Scheer spelled out the Carbon Tax! in black marker on a white plate, donned safety glasses, and smashed it in a gleeful if somewhat cheesy performance of the traditional Greek celebration at a political event. In parts of Canada dependent on the energy industry for its economy, Trudeau is highly unpopular, facing boos even at the peak of his popularity nationwide.\n\nTrudeau is also running as a sort of anti-Trump for the region, repeatedly referencing the alleged polarization of the Western political climate and how embracing leftist policies can temper its effect. The campaign, for now, appears to be working, though not by much – early polls show Trudeau's Liberals with a four-point lead over the Conservatives, whose major challenge will be Scheer's relatively lackluster name recognition.\n\nBolivia\n\nFew doubt that longtime socialist leader Evo Morales will win Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, scheduled to take place in October. What makes this election interesting is the growing concern that it will neither be free nor fair, as Morales should not legally be allowed to appear on the ballot in the first place.\n\nBolivia held a referendum on term limits in 2016, and the people spoke clearly: they did not want Morales to have the ability to run for yet another turn. Morales responded to this news by turning to the nation's Supreme Court, which ruled in December that, despite the referendum, Morales' name should appear on the ballot. If he wins, Morales will begin his fourth term in office.\n\nOpponents call the Supreme Court move a slow-motion coup and organizers have planned protests attended by thousands against Morales. Morales is currently facing five official opponents, the most prominent of which is former president Carlos Mesa, who has made the questionable legality of the Supreme Court ruling a key issue in his campaign.\n\nThe two biggest questions this election poses are whether Mesa can effectively unite the anti-Morales opposition and, in the case that he does, whether Morales' government will allow a free and fair vote, anyway.
Starting this year, the Hungarian government is set to offer free in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures for couples wanting children in order to boost the national birthrate to 2.1 children by 2030.\n\nThe Hungarian government has taken control of six private fertility clinics and plans to purchase new buildings in order to meet demands of the estimated 150,000 couples across the country who have fertility issues but want to have children, La Croix reports.\n\nPreviously, IVF procedures were largely out of reach for many Hungarian couples due to the costs associated with the procedure, but now the pro-family government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is planning to give all couples free access.\n\nSecretary of State for the Family Katalin Novák commented on the new measures saying: If all couples who want a child manage to have a baby, Hungary will no longer have demographic problems.\n\nHungary currently faces a demographic winter if trends are not reversed, with the population expected to decline from the current 9.7 million to six million by the year 2070.\n\nHungarian Government Will Give $33,000 Bonus to Married Couples Who Have Three Children https://t.co/twV072eq7e — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 1, 2019\n\nOther nations have largely relied on mass migration to counter demographic trends and ageing populations but the Orbán government has, instead, adopted arguably the most pro-family policies in the world in order to avoid turning to migration to reverse population decline.\n\nAmong the policies adopted by the government last year has been a 30,000 euro loan to couples which is completely forgiven if they have three children. Hungary has also introduced tax breaks for families as well as extending daycare options or an allowance for elderly relatives who care for children.\n\nAnother programme will also see women with four or more children becoming exempt from income taxes for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn our minds, immigration means surrender, Prime Minister Orbán said last year, and added: If we resign ourselves to the fact that we are unable to sustain ourselves even biologically, by doing so we admit that we are not important even for ourselves.
The homeless population in New York City has reached an all-time high.\n\nNew York City's Department of Homeless Services said 60,252 people remain homeless, up 200 in two weeks, CBS New York reports.\n\nIt's definitely something that we cannot stand for as a city, NYC Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said.\n\nViverto told CBS New York that one possible way to solve this problem in the city would be to expand the Living in Communities (LINC) voucher program, a program that gives money to those in homeless shelters to spend on more permanent housing options. But some landlords might be hesitant to participate in the program.\n\nI think the challenge that we've seen with the current voucher program, subsidy program, the LINC program, is for a very short period of time, there may be some hesitancy by landlords to engage with the city on it, she said.\n\nViverto is not the only city official to comment on this disturbing trend in New York City.\n\nComptroller Scott Stringer called the lack of child care at city shelters a tragedy for the city.\n\nFormer NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who now runs a program for the homeless called WIN, called on the city to create a position that would be in charge of finding permanent housing options for the homeless.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio insists that solutions are coming. Some of the biggest tools, weapons, we have to address homelessness are on the way, he said in response to a question about the issue. There's a lot more coming, and we intend to turn the tide, but it's going to be a long battle.\n\nSo far, the mayor's office is working on a new initiative that would require 25 percent of the apartments built under a tax exemption plan to be set aside for the homeless.\n\nBut the mayor's office declined to give any more specifics, saying more plans are in the works, but there is nothing that can be shared yet.
half of the blue-collar migrants who openly crossed the southern border between 2014 and 2019 remain in the united states, according to march 2020 data posted by the department of homeland security.\n\nagents registered 3.5 million arrivals and sent 1.8 million back home via deportations and repatriations by march 2020, said the december 31 report. the report did not include data about the additional migrants who successfully sneaked through the border.\n\nbut 280,000 of the 3.5 million were provided relief, so allowing them to stay in the united states and eventually get green cards.\n\nthat means one in 12 blue-collar migrants get the colossal prize of u.s. residency and citizenship for themselves and all of their descendants — in exchange for surviving the u.s. government's semi-formal obstacle course of cartels and coyotes, distance and bribes, judges and lawyers, deserts, walls, and border agents.\n\nmoreover, another 1.4 million blue-collar migrants are still living in the united states, mostly while they are waiting for a final court decision, said the report, titled fiscal year 2020 enforcement lifecycle report.\n\nmany of those 1.4 million not-deported migrants take jobs from u.s. employers. the imported labor reduces the marketplace pressure on employers to compete for american workers with offers of higher wages, better working conditions, and more investment in labor-saving machinery.\n\namid enthusiastic sympathy from white-collar progressives, the migrants hold down americans' blue-collar wages while also nudging up rents, and they crowd into the k-12 schools needed by the children of blue-collar americans.\n\ncitizenship is the first prize in the migration obstacle course, said mark krikorian, director of the center for immigration studies. but, he added, everybody who gets in wins something. he continued:\n\nif you get in, and can live and work here for a while — even if you ultimately lose, and even if you're taken into custody and sent home — you've still gotten a year or two or three years of ability to live in the united states, to work here, and to establish the connections and networks that lead to future migration.\n\nonly the migrants who get sent home immediately don't get anything, he said:\n\nsome people lose if they mortgaged their little farm or home to pay the smuggler and are turned around immediately (before they can get a u.s. job to repay the loan), or if they're victimized during the trip. that's a real loss. no question about it, a real cost.\n\nmost white-collar migrants arrive via the visa worker obstacle course. they include the roughly one million h-1b workers and spouses used by silicon valley companies and other firms, the j-1 workers at universities and healthcare chains, and the opt workers used in the outsourced software sweatshops at the bottom of the fortune 500's labor pyramid.\n\nthe dhs data shows that 1.8 million southern border migrants were repatriated from 2014 to march 2020.\n\nbut the dhs data does not show how many of those deported migrants were deported on arrival without being released into the job market.\n\nimmigration officers sent 840,000 migrants home via expedited processing. another 600,000 were sent home because they had been deported previously — dubbed reinstatement of removal — and 240,000 other arrivals were sent home as returns because they had faced incomplete deportation charges in prior years.\n\nthe data also shows that 300,000 migrants have been given a final order to go home — but have not returned home. that number includes roughly 76,000 people who skipped out on their court hearings. many of those illegals hold jobs in democrat-run sanctuary cities, much to the disadvantage of lower-skilled and younger americans.\n\nthe data shows that 1.1 million migrants remain in the united states while they wait for a final courtroom decision on whether they can stay or must go home.\n\nthe dhs report said:\n\nencounters with these different groups tend to lead to different paths through the enforcement system, both in terms of whether and how quickly encounters are resolved and what resolution is reached: encounters with mexicans tend to lead to repatriations; encounters with central americans tend to remain unresolved; and encounters with nationals from countries other than mexico or the northern triangle tend (on average) to lead to relief. encounters with single adults tend to quickly lead to repatriations, while encounters with fmuas [spouses and children] and non-contiguous uacs [unaccompanied alien children] tend to remain unresolved. encounters with aliens who do not claim a fear of return to their home countries tend to be repatriated, while those who claim fear are more likely to remain in the united states and some eventually get relief.\n\nan appendix to the dhs report shows that 315,000 uacs were accompanied from central america to the border by coyotes from 2013 to 2020. the vast majority were the children of illegal immigrants who had earned enough money in u.s. jobs to hire coyotes to escort their children to u.s. border officers, who then deliver the young migrants to their parents. only about 15,000 of these younger migrants have been sent home, while roughly 90,000 were allowed to stay — even though many were coming to work as child laborers in jobs that would have been held by americans.\n\nthe coyotes and migrants improve their odds when they overwhelm the border system, detention facilities, and courtrooms, the dhs report indicated:\n\nthe detention pattern yielding the greatest share of unresolved cases were encounters initially placed in detention but then released prior to a final enforcement outcome. these partially detained encounters resulted in repatriations just 3 percent of the time and relief just 12 percent of the time, with 85 percent still unresolved, including 18 percent with unexecuted removal orders (14 percent in absentia orders).\n\nthat coyotes' strategy was recently aided by three california judges who directed the agencies to reopen the 1997 flores catch-and-release gateway through the border.\n\noverall, the low ratio of total losers to partial or complete winners will encourage the next wave of migrants, said krikorian:\n\nhow could it not, especially once the [joe] biden administration comes and let's even more people in? even if you don't win first prize, the second or third prizes are still pretty good, and with a democratic administration that is going to be more lax in border enforcement, we're practically inviting people to sneak across the border.\n\npresident-elect joe biden says his border policies will emphasize the need for family reunification. his policy may help more illegal migrants get into the united states by pleading a need to join their spouses, parents, uncles, or aunts.
traumatised by its nazi past, post-war germany has carefully relegated right-wing populist movements to the fringes of politics, but the anti-migrant afd may have muscled its way in from the cold.\n\nwith discontent growing in germany over chancellor angela merkel's liberal refugee policy, the populist alternative for germany (afd) on sunday captured seats in the regional parliaments of baden-wuerttemberg, rhineland palatinate and saxony-anhalt.\n\nit garnered as many as close to one in four votes in saxony-anhalt while in the other two states, support reached between 12.5 and 15 percent, projections based on partial results showed.\n\nandreas roedder, contemporary history professor at mainz university, told afp that due to the migrant crisis, we are seeing a normalisation of right-wing populist movements in germany just like elsewhere in europe, even if here, it takes on a special form because we can't ignore germany's past.\n\nthis is not the first time that germany has experienced such a surge in populism since 1945. neither is it the first time that such right-wing parties have been able to capture seats in regional parliaments.\n\nin the 1960s, the npd, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s the republikaner — a splinter party from the csu, the bavarian sister party of merkel's christian democratic union (cdu) — both managed to send deputies to regional parliaments.\n\nbut each time, they have proved to be no more than passing fads.\n\nthe christian conservative alliance of the cdu and csu has thus far been able to occupy the right of the political spectrum, preventing any party from having any lasting claim further right.\n\nthat has until now made german politics unique, compared to austria, switzerland or france, where far-right parties have traditionally had a stronger presence in the political arena.\n\nmuch of the reason boils down to war guilt that has made germans determined to never give the so-called brown shirts a chance to rule the nation again.\n\n– 'shame for germany' –\n\nbut afd has arrived on the political scene at a fortuitous moment.\n\nafter a record 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in germany in 2015 alone, many germans are unsettled by what this sudden surge in newcomers mean for their homeland — a fear that afd has capitalised on.\n\nfirst founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform, it found its first supporters through its claims to defend germans against free-spending southern eu nations.\n\nsince then it has morphed into a party that has even suggested that police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them from entering the country.\n\nwhile its first successes were concentrated in the former communist east, which has been lagging the west in terms of jobs and opportunities, it is now gaining ground also in prosperous western states.\n\nafd has become a national german party, said the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung.\n\nopinion polls suggest that afd might even capture seats in the lower house of parliament in elections in 2017 in what would be an unprecedented success for such a movement.\n\nfinance minister wolfgang schaeuble, known for being a straight-talker, simply described afd as a shame for germany.\n\nuntil now, right-wing populist or extreme-right parties are considered taboo, considered like aliens in the political sphere, said german political analyst wolfgang merkel in a interview with tagesspiegel daily.\n\nmainstream parties have stridently refused any sort of television debate with afd members.\n\nbut the analyst believes that the taboo surrounding such right-wing populism could be soon shattered.\n\nin which case, we would have to live with afd like france does with the national front and switzerland with the svp (swiss people's party), and be confronted daily with xenophobia in political discourse, he said.\n\nsome believe that the chancellor herself is to blame for pushing a middle ground politics that tries to be all things to all people. although her strategy has led her party to win over some from the centre-left social democrats, it has left its right flank exposed.\n\nwith the 'social democratisation' and therefore a shift left of the cdu under the chancellor's mandate, it's more difficult for the christian democrats to cover all bases on the right, said bernhard wessels, political analyst at berlin's humboldt university.\n\ndie welt daily went as far as to say that afd is merkel's child because the cdu has ditched its identity.
in a wednesday op-ed, the los angeles times called for the initiation of wide scale de-trumpification and the shunning of exiting trump administration officials who are described as arsonists fleeing a wreckage they've made.\n\nthe essay, penned by university of california-irvine law professor and former u.n. special rapporteur on free speech david kaye, questions how trump administration officials and appointees, including the shameless liars, the sycophants and the cynical enablers in congress who knowingly sacrificed their reputations to support this president are to be held accountable after the end of president trump's term later this month.\n\nthough exiting political appointees have traditionally landed at prestigious institutions, with some becoming experts in the media, keynote conference speakers, memoirists with book deals, and others running for office or working for the public interest, these should not necessarily be available to former officials of the trump administration, according to kaye.\n\nnot so fast, the essay declares. elite institutions unthinkingly opening their doors to this crew will facilitate exactly what we must avoid: normalizing the trump years and evading a reckoning for trumpism.\n\nkaye then accuses departing trump administration officials as a group, without providing evidence, of having participated in undermining the democratic process, perpetuated lies from podiums, attacked the press, corrupted our foreign policy and intelligence agencies, damaged government departments devoted to the environment and education and much more.\n\nby doing all this, trump officials should forfeit the normally automatic benefits that come from a stint in government, he adds.\n\ncommending only a few who maintained their independence and spoke truth to power inside and out of government, the rest of the trump administration officials are to be met with skepticism about the value [they] bring to any mainstream institution.\n\nlaw firms, for example, should scrutinize trump lawyers carefully as they return to private practice, and corporate boards should just say no.\n\nin addition, the essay calls for journalists and their editors to think hard about how they integrate the voices of trump officials in their stories and to indicate their trump affiliation and role clearly when being quoted.\n\nlastly, kaye calls for a meaningful and high-profile process of public accounting for trump administration actions that overstepped the law.\n\nin the concluding paragraph, kaye seeks to ensure the reader that his propositions are not primitive, though they may appear to be so.\n\nshunning may sound primitive, but it is not, he writes. it can be a way to reinforce democratic values.\n\nthe essay is part of a host of calls on the left to shun conservative voices and at a time of unprecedented purges of such voices on various social media platforms.\n\nlast thursday, a forbes magazine op-ed warned companies about hiring fabulists from the trump administration.\n\nlet it be known to the business world: hire any of trump's fellow fabulists above, and forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie, forbes magazine's chief content officer, randall lane, wrote.\n\nalso last week, the anti-trump lincoln project announced that it was building a database of trump officials and staffers with the intention of holding them professionally accountable for supporting the president.\n\nat @projectlincoln we are constructing a database of trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the trump administration & track where they are now. no personal info, only professional. but they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved https://t.co/dkpxpawawb — stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) january 9, 2021\n\nlast month, a washington post essay encouraged the media to shun republicans who questioned the election results.\n\nthe essay itself admitted promoting a radical approach yet stood by it as the only way to safely proceed with live interviews with republicans who may be carrying a dangerous conspiracy theory that spreads on air.\n\nalso last month, the washington post published an essay comparing denying election results to denying the holocaust and using that as a pretext to silence opposing voices.\n\nwe would not allow a holocaust denier to speak on evening news programs or have free rein on social media, the essay's authors write unequivocally. old and new media alike should no longer give a platform to these dissimulations, starting with trump's.\n\nfollow joshua klein on twitter @joshuaklein.
secretary of state mike pompeo's speech monday at the heritage foundation marked a pivotal moment in u.s. foreign policy.\n\npompeo made several important arguments in the course of his half hour address, in which he set out president donald trump's policy regarding iran in the wake of his may 8 announcement that he is abandoning barack obama's 2015 nuclear deal with iran.\n\nthe key line in his speech was, inarguably, as president trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing and able to negotiate a new deal [with iran]. but the deal is not the objective. our goal is to protect the american people.\n\nthe basic insight that there is no intrinsic value to any agreement – or foreign policy initiative of any sort – that does not advance the interests of the united states or protect the american people is striking, because it has been absent from american foreign policy in relation to rogue regimes and entities for better part of the last generation.\n\nin 1994, when then president bill clinton sought to contend with north korea's illicit nuclear program, the first fantasist president, jimmy carter, turned up in pyongyang to see if there was a deal to be had.\n\nas claudia rosett has noted, north korea was on the ropes back then. its patron, the soviet union, had collapsed three years earlier, and its cash flow had dried up. china was still too poor to pick up the slack, as it had just undergone its first succession. famine was killing north koreans by the tens of thousands.\n\nand it had just been caught, red handed, violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, of which it was a signatory, and developing plutonium-based nuclear weapons at its yangbyon nuclear reactor.\n\nif clinton had confronted the north koreans for their duplicity and malign behavior towards the region and towards their own subjects, he stood a decent chance of bringing an end to the regime.\n\ninstead, following carter's odd intervention, clinton decided to hand the stalinist hermit gulag state a new lease on life. he sent wendy sherman, his special advisor for north korea, to negotiate what became known as the agreed framework.\n\nin exchange for padlocking — but preserving — their plutonium reactor at yangbyon, the north koreans received internationally financed light water reactors and some $4.5 billion in fuel and food aid. the regime was saved, empowered and legitimized.\n\nand north korea's regime wasted no time in cheating on the nuclear deal — developing intercontinental ballistic missiles; testing them; proliferating their missile and nuclear technologies and know-how to iran and syria; and building a nuclear arsenal that now threatens the u.s. and its allies.\n\nbut clinton was happy. he had a deal. he was a statesman. and no matter how much proof surfaced of north korea's continued nuclear activity, he and his advisors — and, later, his successors george w. bush and obama — were unwilling to do a thing about it. the notion that it was possible to cut a deal with north korea was more important than the substance of the deal. the fact that the regime's policies endangered the american people – not to mention all u.s. allies in asia and beyond — was beside the point.\n\nthe point was the deal.\n\nthe same was the case with the palestinians. as clinton, bush and obama all saw it, the only salient question regarding the palestinians was whether or not israel was willing to cut a deal with the palestine liberation organization (plo). they considered plo sponsorship and incitement of terror a mere distraction. the plo's partnership with hamas was said to be a passing phase. plo corruption and embezzlement of billions of dollars in u.s. and international aid dollars was just an irritant.\n\nthe only thing three successive administrations concerned themselves with regarding the palestinians generally, and the plo specifically, was whether or not they would say from time to time that they were willing to cut a deal – any deal – with israel.\n\nas far as all three administrations were concerned, the possibility of mediating a deal — the deal — between israel and the plo was the only u.s. middle east policy that mattered. everything else was secondary. the situation reached a level of absurdity where every issue was viewed as contingent on israel agreeing to make a deal with the palestinians.\n\nfor instance, in 2006, then-president bush appointed former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton to present him with a strategy for dealing with the insurgency in iraq. the two men said that the u.s. could safely withdraw its forces from iraq if it did so while forcing israel to cut a deal with the plo.\n\nwhy iran or syria or their terror proxies in al qaeda, hezbollah, and other militias would stand down if israel gave jerusalem to plo chief mahmoud abbas was never explained.\n\nit was never explained because as everyone who was anyone in washington agreed, u.s. foreign policy in the middle east wasn't about securing the american people per se. it was about cutting a deal.\n\nthis, then, brings us to the so-called joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), better known as the iran nuclear deal, which wendy sherman also negotiated. as she did in 1994 with the north koreans, sherman negotiated a deal based on the notion that it didn't matter what the deal said, but rather only that it was concluded.\n\nu.s. foreign policy officials from the clinton administration on down repeatedly argued that merely signing a deal would create a positive dynamic that would encourage rogue regimes – whether in pyongyang or ramallah or tehran – to change their behavior and assessment of washington and its allies.\n\nthe fact that this assumption has never been borne out by events — and indeed, has been repeatedly contradicted and proven wrong by events — never made an impression on the foreign policy experts who clung to the notion that process is more important than substance.\n\nin this context, the trump doctrine is brilliant in its simplicity and straightforwardness.\n\nthe trump doctrine involves a simple concept: u.s. foreign policy must be grounded in reality rather than fantasy, and its aim is to achieve the only goal that matters: securing and enhancing the security of the american people.\n\nit is a testament to president trump's iconoclasm and common sense that he has embraced reality after so many years of fantasy presidencies.\n\nbut his decision to prefer reality over theory is also borne of necessity. the bill has come due on his predecessors' unhinged deals.\n\nas president trump has noted repeatedly, the u.s. reached the end of the road with north korea. after pyongyang tested intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland of the u.s. last summer, it was clear there was nowhere to kick the can anymore.\n\nwith iran using the status and wealth it received from obama's nuclear deal to realize its imperialist aspirations in the middle east, while actively engaging in armed attacks against israel and saudi arabia, maintaining faith with the nuclear deal that enabled iran to bring the region to the brink of a massive war was no longer an option.\n\nas for the plo and israel, the jig finally is up on that fairytale as well. with its 83-year-old, corrupt, virulently antisemitic, anti-american, terror-supporting leader mahmoud abbas on the verge of death, the palestinian authority is about to decompose altogether or transform into something else. and whatever may happen there, it is now inarguable that the terror group is a bit player, not a power broker.\n\nno regional issue of concern to the u.s. will be ameliorated by appeasing the plo.\n\nas for israel, due to the wreckage of weakened arab allies on the one hand, and empowered enemies left by trump's predecessors on the other, the trump administration cannot follow the old practice of treating israel like a problem. the now-undeniable fact is that when israel strikes iranian installations in syria and iran's proxies in gaza, it is stabilizing the region, not destabilizing the region.\n\nanother undeniable fact is that israel is america's most powerful and trustworthy ally in the middle east. to the extent a deal between the plo and israel weakens israel – and every deal that has been presented over the past 25 years, like the phony peace process itself, has weakened israel – u.s. interests are harmed.\n\nmany commentators have interpreted pompeo's list of twelve specific demands from iran as an opening bid for future negotiations with tehran.\n\nbut his own statements indicate that this is not the case. pompeo rightly explained that all of his demands — from iran ending and dismantling its nuclear program and ballistic missiles program, to ending its sponsorship of terror groups; from withdrawing its forces from syria, to releasing all u.s. and foreign hostages it holds — are basic demands.\n\nthere are so many demands, pompeo explained, because at a fundamental level, iran is breaching the most basic norms of international behavior. every single activity he demanded that iran halt is an activity that undermines not only regional security, but also u.s. national security. as such, compelling iranian compliance with the trump administration's demands is vital to the security of the american people.\n\nthe media echo chamber has made much of the fact that the north korean regime is now making noises to the effect that it is unwilling to make a deal with the trump administration. insults against national security advisor john bolton in the north korean media are pointed to as proof that trump's america first foreign policy is undermining efforts to secure a deal with north korea.\n\nthese commentaries miss the point. as pompeo and trump himself have explained, american foreign policy is no longer driven by a slavish devotion to wendy sherman-esque deals with enemies of america.\n\namerican foreign policy is now about making americans safe in the real world.\n\nand, thanks to the slavish devotion of the previous three administrations to agreements-at-all-cost, achieving the goal of protecting americans has become urgent, dire, and no job for showboaters who want to be loved by europe and msnbc.\n\ncaroline glick is a world-renowned

leader of the conservative austrian people's party (övp) sebastian kurz has announced a coalition agreement with the green party that will see several green policies but no changes to migration policy.\n\nmr kurz, along with green party leader werner kogler presented their new government programme at a joint press conference on thursday, with kurz claiming the new government would be the best of both worlds and that its priorities would be tax reform and fighting illegal immigration, kronen zeitung reports.\n\nthe övp leader added that both parties had also agreed to ban the islamic headscarf for children under the age of 14 and would be expanding programmes to teach new migrants the german language and put more emphasis on getting asylum seekers into the labour force.\n\nkurz has been critical of migration policies within the european union since forming the previous government with the populist freedom party.\n\naustria's sebastian kurz warns of new migrant wave 'brewing' https://t.co/psxwazyfhp — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) september 25, 2019\n\nin 2018, he went as far as confronting german chancellor angela merkel on the issue, disagreeing on her proposal to link eu funds to migration quotas.\n\ngreen leader kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. he also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.\n\nthe two-party leaders then met with leftist austrian president alexander van der bellen, a former member of the green party, with kogler telling the austrian press that the entire programme for the new coalition was still being worked on.\n\nthe greens are expected to occupy four ministerial posts including the environmental ministry and the justice ministry, with the party demanding at least half of the ministers be female.\n\nthe successful government deal comes after kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the austrian national election in september of last year.
senator roy blunt (r-mo), chairman of the senate republican policy committee, said sunday on cbs's face the nation that removing trump from office with impeachment is clearly is not going to happen.\n\ndiscussing the riots, anchor margaret brennan said, are republican leaders going to hold him accountable in any way for it?\n\nblunt said, i think the country is is the right to hold presidents accountable. the president should be very careful over the next 10 days is that his behavior is what you would expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. my personal view is that the president touched the hot stove on wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.\n\nhe continued, i did, the day senator hawley announced he would be contesting those electoral votes, announced that i would not be. when senator cruz said he had a plan to put back in place a commission like the one formed in 1877, i said that wouldn't happen. i wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen just like the impeachment of the president to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he is in office.\n\nhe added, as nancy pelosi just said and jim clyburn said earlier today, this is more about a long-term punishment of the president than trying to remove him from office.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen
six gop senators briefed jared kushner and president donald trump's top congressional aide about a plan to swap two amnesties in exchange for border-wall funding.\n\nthe briefing shows the gop leaders' contempt for trump's immigration-reform campaign promise, said rosemary jenks, policy director at numbersusa. there is no talk in this about asylum reform, tvpra, detention spaces or sanctuary cities, or any of the enforcement needs — it is about amnesty and cheap labor, and that is exactly what candidate tump campaigned against.\n\nthe proposed amnesties-for-wall swap appeared wednesday as trump pressured democrats to reciprocate his compromises on the day after his successful prime-time address to the nation. on thursday, trump will visit the border to call for wall funding.\n\nthe senators' draft offer to the democrats, however, also includes incentives sought by gop-aligned business groups, such as an expansion of the h-2b blue collar visa-worker program.\n\nfew democrats support the h-2b visa program but its inclusion could encourage gop legislators to ignore protests from the gop's pro-american base. several gop senators in the group also support a daca amnesty because it would add more imported workers and consumers to their local markets.\n\ncnn reported:\n\ngop senators privately gathered in sen. lindsey graham's office wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. the long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include $5.7 billion for trump's border wall along with several provisions that could entice democrats. those items include changes to help those who are a part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program as well as immigrants from el salvador and other countries impacted by the temporary protected status program – along with modifications to h-2b visas.\n\nthe daca work-permit program for roughly 800,000 younger illegals was created by former president barack obama in 2012 but is likely to be declared unlawful this year by the supreme court. trump is rolling back the tps program, which grants temporary sanctuary and work permits to more than 300,000 visitors from countries hit by disasters. the tps grants were repeatedly extended by former presidents obama and george w. bush, even after the countries recovered from their disasters.\n\ncnn continued:\n\ngop senators pitched the idea to senior white house adviser jared kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got trump his border wall money and could pass the senate, the white house would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. he did not say trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nhowever, other media outlets did not corroborate cnn's claim that kushner said trump would endorse amnesties and cheap-labor wage-cuts in exchange for a wall.\n\nthe hill reported:\n\ngraham said that under a potential deal the president gets his security funding and can add some things to the mix that would draw some bipartisan support.\n\n… graham summarized the framework as the wall plus something else that he hopes would garner some democratic support.\n\nthe six gop senators included graham, north carolina's thom tillis, tennessee's lamar alexander, ohio's rob portman, alaska's lisa murkowski, and maine's susan collins.\n\nkushner was accompanied by shahira knight, the former banker who now runs trump's outreach to the hill. in august, knight declined to oppose a series of unpopular pro-migration and cheap-labor amendments added to to the draft 2019 homeland security budget by rep. kevin yoder. those giveaway measures were paired with a $5 billion budget for the wall but were blocked when yoder lost his seat in november.\n\nkushner meets with moderate gop senators

included the main backers of a double-amnesty bill that won nearly unanimous democratic support for a series of votes in february.\n\nif that double-amnesty bill — largely drafted by collins and

house.\n\nin the days before that vote, graham also said that employers in his district want to bring in more blue-collar workers. he told reporters on january 21:\n\nwe need more legal immigration. … i don't want green cards just for computer engineers. if you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, i want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, i want them to have a chance to get a green card. i just don't want to be a country in

boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nthe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nimmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.
democratic presidential hopeful sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) responded on sunday's broadcast of cbs's face the nation to remarks by israeli ambassador to the united nations danny danon, who addressed sanders calling prime minister benjamin netanyahu a reactionary racist.\n\npartial transcript as follows:\n\nmargaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the un says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?\n\nsanders: yeah, i do. i mean, they have a lot of money. they have a lot of power. look, i'm jewish and i'm very proud of my jewish heritage. as a kid, i spent time in israel. i am not in- anti-israel. i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people. but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel, but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well. you've got 70 percent youth unemployment in gaza. people can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. it is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even handed policy.\n\nbrennan: yeah.\n\nsanders: so, i am pro-israel. i am pro-palestinian. i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.
dubai, united arab emirates (ap) — netflix faced criticism on wednesday for pulling an episode in saudi arabia of comedian hasan minhaj's patriot act that criticized the kingdom's powerful crown prince.\n\nthe american comedian used his second episode, released on oct. 28, to lambaste crown prince mohammed bin salman over the killing of writer jamal khashoggi and the saudi-led coalition at war in yemen.\n\nminhaj said the crown prince was being hailed as the reformer the arab world needed until khashoggi's killing.\n\nbut the revelations about khashoggi's killing have shattered that image and it blows my mind that it took the killing of a washington post journalist for everyone to go: 'oh i guess he's not really a reformer,' he added. khashoggi wrote critically of the crown prince in columns for the newspaper.\n\nkhashoggi was killed and dismembered by saudi agents inside the saudi consulate in istanbul last year. the u.s. senate has said it believes the crown prince is responsible for the grisly killing, despite insistence by the kingdom that he had no knowledge of the operation.\n\nin the roughly 18-minute monologue, minhaj also mentions the ruling al saud family and its vast wealth, saying: saudi arabia is crazy. one giant family controls everything.\n\nthe saudi-led coalition's airstrikes in yemen have also come under intense scrutiny since khashoggi's killing. the war, which began in march 2015, has killed thousands of civilians and pushed millions to the brink of famine.\n\nthe financial times first reported that netflix yanked the episode from streaming in saudi arabia last week after the government's communications and information technology commission informed the internet streaming service that its content violated cyber-crime laws in the kingdom. the ft says the episode can still be seen on youtube in saudi arabia.\n\nnetflix told the ft it strongly supports artistic freedom worldwide and only removed the episode after it received a legal request and to comply with local law.\n\nofficials at the communications and information technology commission could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nrights group amnesty international said saudi arabia's censorship of netflix is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression.\n\nby bowing to the saudi arabian authorities' demands, netflix is in danger of facilitating the kingdom's zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people's right to freely access information, said samah hadid at amnesty international.\n\nnetflix did not immediately respond to an associated press request for comment.\n\nthe saudi cyber-crime law states that production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine, according to rights group amnesty international.\n\nsaudi prosecutors have used the broadly worded law to imprison rights activists, poets and others who've expressed views deemed critical of the government or its policies on social media.\n\nsince prince mohammed was named heir to the throne in mid-2017, dozens of writers, activists and moderate clerics have been jailed.\n\namong those detained since may of last year are women's rights activists who had long pushed for more freedoms, including the right to drive before it became legal in june. several people with knowledge of their arrest have told the associated press that some of the women detained have been subjected to caning, electrocution and others were also sexually assaulted.
a poll of united states service members and veterans finds that only 39 percent approve of transgender individuals serving in the military.\n\nwhen the sex of the respondent is a factor, the poll – which surveyed the views of 1,031 service members and veterans – shows that 37 percent of male members approve of transgender troops, while 62 percent of females approve.\n\nonly 32 percent of the greatest generation (world war ii) approve of transgender troops, while 39 percent of baby boomers, 42 percent of generation x, and 55 percent of millennials approve.\n\npresident donald trump continued the decades-long policy that bans transgender individuals from military service, but legal challenges to it continue. on friday, however, federal appellate judges in washington, d.c. vacated one injunction that had blocked the policy, though it continues to be blocked by other courts. the supreme court is considering whether it will review the policy.\n\nin response to a statement about having experienced gender or gender identity discrimination in the military, only 11 percent of survey respondents answered yes.\n\nwith sex as a factor, only six percent of male service members say they have experienced gender discrimination, while 68 percent of female members say the same.\n\nsimilarly, 11 percent of participants say they have personally experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment in the military.\n\nof the males, only six percent say they have been sexually assaulted or harassed, while 66 percent of females claim the same.\n\nwhen asked if they had witnessed another member of the service being sexually harassed or assaulted during their military service, 19 percent of those surveyed said yes.\n\nof the male participants, 17 percent said they had witnessed sexual assault or harassment, while 42 percent of the females said the same.\n\nthe survey was conducted by smithsonian in conjunction with both stars and stripes– a publication of the defense department – and the schar school at george mason university.\n\noverall, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percent.
the coronavirus outbreak continues to grow. on wednesday, 201 u.s. citizens who were evacuated from wuhan, china, arrived in the united states and were transported to the march air reserve base in california, where they are being informally quarantined and monitored for a three-day period.\n\nbut there's a crucial group of people who are not being quarantined and monitored—the thousands of chinese nationals sneaking into the united states from mexico.\n\nin december, eleven chinese migrants were caught illegally crossing the border in a rental truck carrying furniture from tijuana to san diego. a month earlier, six chinese migrants had been caught sneaking into the country at the same port of entry using a moving truck. these cases were not isolated instances. they are part of a problem that has been growing for the past two years.\n\nand it's not a problem that's limited to the border regions of california. illegal entries by chinese nationals are on the rise all across the mexican border.\n\nfor example, look at the rio grande valley (rgv) sector, which is the section of border in texas abutting the gulf of mexico. in fy 2019, the number of chinese migrants caught at the southern border in the rgv sector increased 85%, from approximately 700 to over 1,300.\n\nalthough figures for the entire border haven't been made public, it is likely that the number of chinese nationals apprehended at the mexican border is well over 4,000. and, for every illegal alien who is caught at the border, there are at least three who make it in without getting caught.\n\nthat means that, estimating conservatively, more than 12,000 chinese nationals entered the country illegally across the southern border in fy 2019. and none of them were screened for infectious diseases. this year a similar number are sneaking into the united states—coming from the country that is the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nat times like this, it is imperative that the process of immigration be orderly and controlled. a secure border is essential in our defense against not only crime and terrorism, but also against pandemics.\n\nif congress had given the president all of the money for border wall construction that he needed back in 2017, the united states would be in a much better position to address this crisis. the 450 miles of wall that are now in the stages of planning and early construction would already be completed. and it would be much more difficult to enter the united states illegally.\n\nand that means greater security during times of pandemic. the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the united states will undoubtedly grow from the six known cases—in california, arizona, washington state, and illinois. but worthy of note is the case in reynosa, mexico, right next to the u.s. border. the international border next to reynosa is wide open. and so is our vulnerability to the coronavirus being carried across it.\n\nkris w. kobach served as the secretary of state of kansas during 2011-2019. an expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the arizona sb-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ice agents who sued to stop obama's 2012 daca executive amnesty. he currently serves as general counsel for we build the wall and is a candidate for the u.s. senate. his website is www.kriskobach.com.
border patrol agents in the laredo sector discovered 36 illegal immigrants packed into a tiny stash house while assisting officers from the laredo police department on monday.\n\nspecial agents from u.s. immigration and customs enforcement's homeland security investigations division contacted the laredo station about suspicious activity in a house located near slaughter park. the park is a known location for smuggling humans and drugs across the border. the agents went to check out the house with the help of the local police department, according to laredo border patrol officials.\n\nafter making entry into the house, the agents found 36 illegal immigrants stashed inside. the migrants came to the u.s. from guatemala, mexico, el salvador, and honduras, officials stated.\n\nthe partnerships in laredo between the united states border patrol, homeland security investigations, and the laredo police department continue to show results in disrupting criminal organizations from operating in south texas. we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prosecute those responsible and prevent individuals from being subjected to deplorable conditions, laredo sector assistant chief patrol agent gabriel acosta said in a written statement.\n\nhomeland security investigations is leading the investigation into the possible human trafficking charges that could be filed.\n\nthe migrants are now subject to prosecution in criminal court for illegally entering the u.s. according to a zero tolerance policy put in place by u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on monday.\n\nthe attorney general said his department will refer anyone who enters the united states illegally for prosecution, breitbart news reported.\n\nand the department of justice will take up as many of those cases as humanly possible until we get to 100 percent, sessions said as part of a speech at a law enforcement conference in arizona.
a handful of republican and democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for president trump's proposed border wall along the u.s.-mexico border.\n\nrep. mark meadows (r-nc), as well as sen. lindsey graham (r-sc), and democrats such as rep. jackie speier (d-ca) and debbie dingell (d-mi) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.\n\nin an interview with yahoo news, meadows said he has had multiple conversations with graham about a daca amnesty-for-wall funding deal:\n\ncompromise and finding common ground are not void from the conversations that he and i have had, as well as some of the conversations i've had with some of my democratic colleagues, meadows said. [emphasis added] though the freedom caucus has previously opposed extending protections from deportation for the children of undocumented immigrants, meadows suggested he would be open to a deal to preserve such concessions in exchange for wall funding. [emphasis added]\n\ngraham has touted an amnesty for daca illegal aliens for months as part of a deal on funding at least a portion of trump's proposed wall.\n\ncoincidentally, the daca amnesty deal is supported by the billionaire donor class that delivers campaign funds every election cycle to republicans and democrats who support the country's mass illegal and legal immigration policy of importing about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers every year to compete against america's working and middle class.\n\nas breitbart news most recently reported, the billionaire koch brothers and their network of organizations have made passing an amnesty for daca illegal aliens their goal for the new year.\n\nsimilarly, billionaire facebook ceo mark zuckerberg's cheap labor lobbying group fwd.us is asking republicans, democrats, and the trump administration to reach a deal whereby daca illegal aliens are allowed to permanently remain in the u.s.\n\nthe organization, founded and funded by silicon valley's tech plutocrats, has been demanding an amnesty for daca illegal aliens since at least 2017.\n\nso here is what ⁦@fwdus⁩ would like to see happen with the incoming congress, this harmful shutdown and urgently needed immigration policy changes… pic.twitter.com/zffgeppvbg — todd schulte (@thetoddschulte) january 3, 2019\n\non fox news, operated by billionaire rupert murdoch, a deal wherby daca illegal aliens are given amnesty in exchange for some border wall funding has been floated repeatedly. last week, a fox news host touted such a plan with white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney.\n\nbut let me ask this, we're talking about money, $5 billion $1.5 billion, $2.7 billion, the host said. why aren't there other things on the table? daca for example, is that being negotiated?\n\nmulvaney said that while the money for a border wall is being negotiated, other changes to the country's immigration system are being discussed as well, though he did not specifically cite the daca program as one of those changes.\n\nany form of amnesty coupled with funds to build a wall along the southern border would render the barrier almost useless in stopping illegal immigration, breitbart news has noted.\n\nwhile a border wall would take years to build, amnesty for illegal aliens would be nearly immediate, delivering benefits to illegal aliens and foreign nationals first, while americans only see the hope of a border wall down the road.\n\nin terms of legal immigration, a daca amnesty would implement a never-ending flow of foreign relatives to the daca illegal aliens who can be readily sponsored for green cards through the process known as chain migration — a flow of potentially more than 8.5 million legal immigrants.\n\nmeanwhile, a daca amnesty would drag increasing u.s. wages down for the country's working and middle class, delivering benefits to the business lobby while squashing the intended goals of the trump administration ahead of the 2020 presidential election. the plan is also likely to hit the black american community the hardest, as they are forced to compete for blue collar jobs against a growing illegal and legal immigrant population from central america.
thursday on fox news channel's the o'reilly factor, host bill o'reilly offered his takeaways from the terrorist attacks in brussels earlier this week.\n\no'reilly argued much of this could have been prevented if not for european governments' policy decisions on immigration and on policing.\n\nso to repeat, [obama] is not going to use american resources to defeat isis, o'reilly said. second thing we've learned: europe is in chaos. as you know, millions of mostly islamic refugees are pouring into western europe. nobody knows who they are, nobody knows what they're doing. in belgium where the bombers struck this week intelligence agents cannot tap telephones, they cannot look into computers, and police are restrained from raiding private homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and belgium wonders why it is a terror target? the incredible laxity on immigration and the ultra-liberal policing have made europe the easiest target in the world for isis. and believe me if the far left had its way here, we'd be just like belgium.\n\nfollow jeff poor on twitter @jeff_poor
many americans may not know her name, but gary kaltbaum appeared on breitbart news thursday to explain why federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen is the most important woman in our lives.\n\njanet yellen is able to move the purse strings around in ways unimaginable, said kaltbaum. keep in mind, this started with ben bernanke, who decided to go with this grand experiment of zero percent interest rates, and the printing of trillions of dollars, which led to janet yellen.\n\nkaltbaum charged bernanke's money-manipulation policies with causing the housing market bubble and crash, leading in turn to the desperate bank bailouts of 2008. that meant big money for big bankers… and the screwing of the average american.\n\nthat's because average americans find it difficult to earn money through savings in a zero-interest environment.\n\nas breitbart news host stephen k. bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. the punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.\n\nthe riskless income investor was taken away and was given to the banks, said kaltbaum. it was gifted to the banks, and that's why the banks have done better over the last few years.\n\nfew politicians see political gain in railing against this state of affairs, including the socialists from the ostensible party of the little guy. the democratic party is not for the middle class and poor, said kaltbaum. they're for the middle class and poor's votes. go look at all their policies. just recently, barack obama is proposing a ten percent tax on oil companies, where everybody knows it's gonna be flushed down into the consumer. who gets hit the worst? the poor and the middle class.\n\nbut nobody says anything, he sighed. this is about currying votes… keep marketing to these people that you're the end-all and be-all. you're going to do this, that, and the other thing for them. but they end up doing nothing for nobody, except themselves, and their own power base.\n\nkaltbaum saw little hope of a popular revolt against these exploitative policies until the masses have been properly educated in economics – an education they will never receive from a mass media with the democrat party's political interests at heart, and a natural tendency to revere big, splashy, centrally-planned solutions to the nation's problems.\n\nin an interconnected global economy, the world's problems become america's problems, too. while the coming financial implosion of china is seen as both a financial and national-security threat by almost every u.s. government agency, kaltbaum said the even worse news is that america's fiscal situation is more troubling than china's.\n\nwe are the country that's $20 trillion in debt, he warned. we are the country that has papered over this with $5 trillion in printed money, and zero percent interest rates. we are the country where taxes, and mandates, and regulations are going up, and government is taking over our life.\n\nit's a combination of china, and europe, and its socialist states and their massive debt, and our country – which has gone from a great, market-based, free market economy into something that is controlled by these big, power-hungry, power-centric maniacs that present a looming crisis for the american taxpayer… which, of course, will also be forced to clean up the wreckage afterward, and pick up the tab for the failures of their political elites.\n\nbannon noted that janet yellen wasn't prepared to say that even a lunatic policy like japan's negative interest rates would be beyond her authority. i've got news for you – even if it's illegal, they'll make it legal anyway, kaltbaum agreed, citing president obama's abuse of executive power as precedent.\n\nanything is possible at this point in time, he concluded. as the markets go lower, we're going to see more acts of desperation, and they're going to try to come up with things that, in our lifetimes, we would never even dream would occur. and i suspect negative interest rates will probably be a part of it.\n\nlisten:
sen. pat roberts (r-ks), chairman of the senate agriculture committee, announced friday he will not seek another term in the u.s. senate.\n\njust in: gop sen. pat roberts of kansas announces he won't seek reelection in 2020. never, never in my wildest dreams did i think i would become the longest-serving member of congress in our state's history pic.twitter.com/soz1bpplbd — tictoc by bloomberg (@tictoc) january 4, 2019\n\nspeaking before reporters in manhattan, kansas, roberts said: i am announcing i will serve the remainder of this term as your senator, fighting for kansas in these troubled times. however, i will not be a candidate in 2020 for a fifth senate term.\n\nnever, never in my wildest dreams did i think i would become the longest-serving member of congress in our state's history, he added.\n\nroberts, 82, maneuvered the 2018 farm bill through congress with support from both parties — a move ultimately embraced by president donald trump as a rare bipartisan success. however, some republican critics argue roberts' work across the aisle resulted in a deeply flawed and costly farm bill that represents a betrayal of conservative values. it's a slap in the face to ronald reagan, said robert rector, senior research fellow at the heritage foundation. it's a victory for a massive welfare state without work requirements and an out-of-control budget.\n\nno one had yet announced a primary challenge against roberts, but conservative activists viewed him as vulnerable from the right. he narrowly survived a primary against tea party candidate milton wolf in 2014. republicans including outgoing gov. jeff colyer (r) and rep. roger marshall (r-ks) are eyeing a race in anticipation that roberts might not run.\n\nin a december opinion-editorial, the kansas city star's editorial board called on roberts to retire and step aside to allow other qualified candidates to seek the office.\n\n[t]he 21st century will demand fresher ideas — not just on farm policy, but on trade, immigration, taxation, spending, defense and other national challenges. roberts isn't the senator who will provide those new ideas, the bluntly stated op-ed read. this isn't a matter of the senator's age, although roberts will be 84 years old in 2020. it's much more about roberts' four decades of service in the house and senate, a long tenure that makes it difficult for him to see things in a different way.\n\nroberts has served as the senior senator from kansas since 1997 and was elected in his home state's first congressional district to the house of representatives in 1980.\n\nsen. lamar alexander (r-tn) announced last month that he will not run for re-election in 2020.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report.
the director of national intelligence called transnational organized crime a growing threat to the security and health of u.s. citizens. the director said these groups, including mexican drug cartels and ms-13 cliques, contribute to increased social violence and the erosion of governmental authority in many countries.\n\nmexican criminal groups will continue to supply much of the heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana that cross the us-mexico border, while china-based suppliers ship fentanyls and fentanyl precursors to mexico-, canada-, and u.s. based distributors or sell directly to consumers via the internet, daniel r. coats, director of national intelligence (dni) wrote in a worldwide threat assessment report released on tuesday (attached below).\n\nin 2016, the report states that drug overdoses accounted for more deaths than suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and all forms of homicide. the number of drug overdoses skyrocketed during the past two years–doubling in 2016 because of the national opioid epidemic.\n\ntransnational organized criminal groups probably will generate more revenue from illicit activity in the coming year, which the un last estimated at $1.6-$2.2 trillion for 2014, the dni continued.\n\nin addition to drug smuggling, the director also listed the continuing human trafficking enterprises carried out around the world by transnational criminal organizations. the dni estimates that about 25 million people are victimized by human traffickers.\n\nthe dni listed epidemic criminal activity as one of the key political issues for 2016.\n\npresidential elections, including those in mexico and colombia, will occur at a time when support for political parties and governing institutions is at record lows and could bolster the appeal of outsider candidates, the report states.\n\nregarding mexico specifically, the director coats wrote:\n\nmexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for july 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. the mexican government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. president enrique pena nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the september 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential us policy shifts ahead of the elections. in recent years, mexican us-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.\n\nbreitbart texas has reported extensively on the unstable political climate created by the mexican drug cartels through its cartel chronicles series. the series utilizes citizen journalists who are willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\n\nthe reports from mexico record the ultra-violent activities of the drug cartels — particularly in the civil war-torn region of tamaulipas, just south of the texas border.\n\ncartel chronicles reported on tuesday about the kidnapping and murder of a federal narcotics agent near cancun.\n\nthe anonymous writer reported:\n\nmexican federal law enforcement sources revealed to breitbart texas that late last week, 27-year-old hugo enrique rafael peña went missing and was discovered hours later–shot multiple times, blindfolded with tape, and hands tied. according to police file 65/2018, authorities found 11 9mm bullet casings at the scene.\n\nbreitbart texas also reports on u.s. prosecutors' efforts to extradite former mexican governors for their alleged roles in narcotics trafficking and public corruption.\n\nbreitbart texas editor-in-chief and managing director, brandon darby, and investigative journalist ildefonso ortiz reported:\n\nformer tamaulipas governor eugenio hernandez flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the southern district of texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. the case against hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by u.s. homeland security investigations and the u.s. drug enforcement administration. … hernandez and his predecessor, tomas yarrington ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by u.s. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into texas. as breitbart texas reported, yarrington is currently in an italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the u.s. related to los zetas, the gulf, and the beltran leyva cartels.\n\ndirector coats also addressed the massive migration of people from central american and attributed this crisis to gang-related violence, particularly in countries like el salvador, honduras, and guatemala.\n\nthe report concludes:\n\ninsecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the northern triangle countries of el salvador, guatemala, and honduras. homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting central americans to flee.\n\nthe director prepared the worldwide threat assessment report for 2018 in preparation for testimony before the senate intelligence committee on tuesday.\n\nbob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx, gab, and facebook.\n\nworldwide threat assessment — 2018 — us director of national intelligence by bob price on scribd

the official twitter account for the international civil aviation organization (icao), the united nations airspace body, spent much of monday and tuesday blocking social media users who noted that its exclusion of taiwan is particularly dangerous in the context of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in china.\n\nthe icao, like the world health organization (who) and the u.n. itself, refuses to recognize taiwan's sovereignty as part of its relationship with china. china considers taiwan a rogue province under its legitimate control despite the fact that taiwan is fully independent of beijing and the island has never in history formed part of the people's republic. beijing insists that any state seeking diplomatic relations with china, or any international body seeking its cooperation, ignore taiwan's sovereignty and reject any attempts by the taiwanese government to establish ties.\n\nthe head of the icao, secretary-general fang liu, was formerly an aviation official for the chinese communist party. the party has a history of disappearing its alums who go on to head international organizations if they do not strictly obey its commands, even abroad.\n\ntaiwan has documented eight cases of the new coronavirus – which causes respiratory system damage, pneumonia, and death – as of wednesday morning, according to its government. the who considers taiwan a province of china and thus does not distinguish taiwanese cases as separate from the nearly 6,000 cases documented in that country. the virus has killed 132 people at press time, all within china. most cases have been documented in wuhan, the central chinese metropolis where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\ntaiwan operates some of the world's busiest airports and, close to some of the hardest-hit provinces in southern china, is geographically critical to monitoring travelers and containing the virus. yet the icao, which claims to be playing a supporting role in u.n. coronavirus response, rejects any attempts by taipei to join the global conversation on how to contain the outbreak.\n\nthe hong kong free press (hkfp) reported on tuesday that the growing scandal surrounding the icao began on saturday, when user jessica drun, a non-resident fellow at the project 2049 institute, revealed that the icao blocked her on twitter after she questioned the organization's exclusion of taiwan from coronavirus response measures.\n\nhey everyone, check this out– i've been blocked by the international civil aviation organization (@icao), a @un specialized agency, for assumedly tweeting about the need for taiwan's inclusion (not membership) in light of a global health crisis. 1/ pic.twitter.com/yezur36xvp — jessica drun (@jessicadrun) january 25, 2020\n\ndrun had originally questioned both the icao and the who, writing, want to drive the point home that two orgs, @who & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ taiwan authorities. this means civil aviation authorities for one of busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential icao-who efforts. this is how a virus spreads.\n\nfollowing drun's revelation that the icao had blocked her, several others also objecting to taiwan's exclusion reported having the same experience. others criticized the icao for not doing enough to save lives and instead received ill-timed mockery.\n\nas reports of the icao blocking users concerned about the coronavirus outbreak spread, american officials issued statements condemning the united nations organization. the foreign affairs committee of the house of representatives issued a statement on twitter on monday denouncing the icao for silencing dissent.\n\nthe united nation's @icao plays a valuable role in ensuring aviation security. but silencing voices that oppose icao's exclusion of taiwan goes against their stated principles of fairness, inclusion, and transparency, the twitter post read. individual members of congress also expressed outrage at the u.n. organization, which is tasked with representing the interests of all global civilians, silencing legitimate questions on its treatment of taiwan.\n\ntaiwan's foreign ministry thanked those supporting its inclusion in the global response to coronavirus on twitter. the ministry has also lodged a solemn protest before the icao, which is headquartered in canada.\n\nsupporting #taiwan's inclusion in @icao is communicating misinformation?

in a recent thread on his own platform, twitter ceo jack dorsey discussed the recent suspension of president donald trump, stating that he believes it was the right decision and that the mass blacklisting of trump by the silicon valley masters of the universe was not coordinated, writing more likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\nin a recent tweet thread, twitter ceo jack dorsey discussed the company's recent decision to permanently suspend president trump from its platform. the company stated last week that president trump was suspended from the platform due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\n\nnow, dorsey has discussed the decision at length in a tweet thread which can be found here. dorsey wrote in the thread:\n\ni do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realdonaldtrump from twitter, or how we got here. after a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter. was this correct? i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\n\ndorsey went on to say that the ban had significant ramifications, adding that while there are clear and obvious exceptions, i feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.\n\nhe further added that he didn't believe that the mass de-platforming of president trump was coordinated, stating: i do not believe this was coordinated. more likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\ndorsey finished the tweet thread stating: i believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. i also recognize it does not feel that way today. everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together.\n\nbreitbart news recently reported that twitter stock dropped by as much as 12.3 percent on monday morning this week, reaching a low as $45.17 per share.\n\nit was noted by multiple analysts that the decision to suspend president trump could reignite legislation to revoke section 230, which protects internet companies from liability for content users posts according to analyst notes. bank of america securities analysts said in a note to clients: while a democratic administration may be less focused on significant reform of section 230, recent events may make content legislation more likely.\n\nread more at breitbart news here.\n\nlucas nolan is a reporter for breitbart news covering issues of free speech and online censorship. follow him on twitter @lucasnolan or contact via secure email at the address lucasnolan@protonmail.com
friday on msnbc's andrea mitchell reports, chuck todd, the moderator of nbc's meet the press, said one of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton's vulnerabilities is the miscalculation to topple libyan dictator muammar gaddafi because it helped to create the dangerous conditions that lead to the 2012 benghazi terror attack.\n\ntodd said, competency has been her strength but i do believe what benghazi and libya present was this was an example of her being miscalculating, the policy was wrong. i've always believed she's more vulnerable than on the policy than on what happened. you know, why was benghazi a dangerous situation? because of the decision to topple qaddafi. that has always been her real policy vulnerability there. i actually think the incompetent tag, i see what he's trying to do there.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen

president tsai ing-wen of taiwan responded vigorously to a speech this week by chinese communist party chief xi jinping announcing that china would no longer tolerate taiwan's sovereignty, urging xi to bravely move towards democracy and face the reality of the existence of the republic of china.\n\nin his speech on tuesday, xi called taiwanese independence a dead end and warned that, in 2019, china would no longer accept the status quo.\n\nwe make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he warned.\n\ntsai, speaking on wednesday, responded by lamenting that china has consistently rejected the democratic values that, according to her, define the national identity of taiwan and condemned china for spending much of 2018 attempting to bribe taiwan's allies away from recognizing the nation's sovereignty.\n\ndemocratic values are the values and way of life that taiwanese cherish, and we call upon china to bravely move towards democracy, tsai declared. this is the only way they can truly understand taiwanese people's ideas and commitments.\n\ntsai called on china to face the reality of the existence of the republic of china (taiwan), and not deny the democratic system that the people of taiwan have established together. she insisted that taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems,' the policy in place for hong kong, which nominally allows hong kong to remain democratic but technically deprives it of sovereignty. xi's regime has increasingly crippled hong kong's ability to govern itself under one country, two systems by banning political candidates anathema to the communist party's interest from running for office.\n\ntsai also implied that china's behavior towards taiwan, particularly since she took over as president in 2016, had brought it international embarrassment. i want to remind the beijing authorities that a superpower must act with the demeanor and take the responsibility of a superpower, she noted, and international society is watching china to see if it can make changes and become a trustworthy partner.\n\npressuring international corporations to change their designation for taiwan won't bring about a spiritual union, nor will buying off taiwan's diplomatic allies or circling taiwan with military aircraft and naval vessels, tsai concluded.\n\nthe latter remark referred to china's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. throughout 2018, companies such as ikea, american airlines, and marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive chinese market. three major airlines in the united states ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying taiwan as a country even as the u.s. government dismissed china's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a twitter post by a group called friends of tibet, which opposes communism.\n\nchina has also used its belt and road initiative (bri, or one belt, one road) to offer high-interest loans to nations that maintain friendly relations with taiwan, notably in latin america. nations like the dominican republic and el salvador announced last year they no longer recognized taiwan's sovereignty after lucrative business meetings with beijing's representatives. an enraged tsai warned the world in august that china's increasingly out of control behavior was not only a threat to cross-strait peace … [but] caused high levels of global instability.\n\ntsai's speech on wednesday followed new year's remarks from xi jinping warning that 2019 would be the last year china would tolerate taiwan's existence.\n\nreunification is a historical trend and it is the right path. taiwan independence is an adverse current of history and is a dead end, xi announced. the issue of taiwan is part of china's domestic politics. it is a core interest of china, and the … feelings of the chinese people, and foreign interference is intolerable.\n\nhe added that chinese officials make no promise to abandon the use of force to end taiwan's independence.\n\nasked about the aggressive remarks on wednesday, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang claimed to reporters that xi was not speaking for china, but for the world.\n\nxi made it very clear in his speech that adherence to the one-china principle is a consensus shared by the international community, lu said. the international community generally understands and supports the just cause of the chinese people in opposing 'taiwan independence' separatist activities and realizing national reunification.\n\nwe make no promise to renounce the use of force. this does not target compatriots in taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of 'taiwan independence' separatists and their activities, he added, likely alluding to the united states as an external force against beijing's interests on the matter.\n\nthe threat of use of force is not new for xi's regime. in october, chinese defense minister wei fenghe said during remarks to the press that if someone tries to separate out taiwan, china's military will take the necessary actions at any cost. two months later, the people's liberation army (pla) reportedly deployed a significantly larger fleet of naval vessels to the taiwan strait, presumably to surround taiwan's military and intimidate u.s. ships in the area. the chinese foreign ministry argued this was necessary because a u.s. navy ship had traveled through the sovereign vietnamese waters

pro-life groups oppose a democrat spending bill on thursday that increases money for abortion programs while including no increased border wall funding.\n\nthe house democrat majority plans to vote on a spending bill that will end the partial government spending program. the spending bill includes a provision that repeals a provision instituted by president donald trump that would require foreign non-government organizations (ngos) to assure that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nthe stipulation, known as the protecting life in global health assistance policy, used to be called the mexico city policy, known by some critics as the global gag rule.\n\nthe democrat bill increases the united nations population fund by $5 million to $37.5 million. pro-life groups contend that the program leads to coercive abortions and involuntary sterilizations.\n\nthe legislation also increases funding for the united nations populations fund, which provides contraception and hopes to reduce childhood deaths. trump ended american financing for the group because pro-life groups oppose its relationship with china, which discourages its citizens from having more than two children.\n\nthe legislation mirrors some of the provisions contained in the senate appropriations committee spending bill, which passed through the committee unanimously. the bill does not include president trump's requested $5 billion in border wall funding.\n\nmarjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, said that democrats are already trying to foist a radical pro-abortion agenda on the nation.\n\na strong majority of americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, dannenfelser said.\n\nthe leader of the susan b. anthony list said that repealing trump's policy would make taxpayers complicit in the exportation of abortion and destruction of countless unborn children around the world. this is unconscionable, and we oppose the bill in the strongest terms.\n\nthe democrat spending bill faces slim prospects of passing through the republican-controlled senate. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) said he would only put a vote on the chamber's floor if president trump endorsed the bill and it included border wall funding.\n\nmatt wolking, communications director for sen. bill cassidy (r-la), tweeted on thursday that nancy pelosi will not provide money to protect americans from illegal immigrants; however, she will increase funding for abortion.\n\nnancy pelosi's funding plan won't provide a single dollar to protect americans from being murdered by illegal immigrants, wolking wrote. but it will provide $5 million dollars for a un program that promotes abortion and the forced sterilization of people of color:
former longtime univision anchor maría elena salinas revealed on tuesday evening that many latinos are buying the arguments president donald trump is making about illegal immigration.\n\nsalinas, whom the new york times once described as the voice of hispanic america, told cnn host don lemon after trump's tuesday evening oval office address that she is saddened that latinos are buying some of these arguments against undocumented immigrants that trump has been making.\n\nand it's very sad to see that our own people, who are immigrants themselves, are attacking these immigrants that are trying to come in, knowing themselves how difficult the situation is in a lot of these latin american countries, she continued. and, you know, they're buying it, and some people, just like some other trump supporters, are saying, well, you know, so what if he tells lies, as long as we have lower unemployment among the latino community.\n\nin his oval office address, trump specifically mentioned that illegal immigration hurts african-americans and hispanic americans.\n\nit strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages, trump said of illegal immigration. among those hardest hit are african-americans and hispanic americans.\n\nduring the 2016 presidential campaign, trump, in addition to making the economic case for fewer illegal immigrants, also explicitly pointed out that the media often ignore latino families who have been victimized by illegal immigrant crimes.\n\ntrump ended up shocking the political and media establishments by doing better among hispanic voters than mitt romney did four years before. and though the media have tried to vilify trump as a racist who hates brown people, trump's support among latinos has remained steady.\n\na december associated press report pointed out the gop's position among hispanics has not weakened during the trump administration, despite the president's rhetoric against immigrants and the party's shift to the right on immigration.\n\nthough latino voters are a key part of the democratic coalition, there is a larger bloc of reliable republican latinos than many think, the associated press explained.\n\nap's votecast data from the 2018 midterm elections reportedly found that  32 percent of latinos voted for republicans while other midterm election surveys also found roughly one-third of latinos supporting the gop.\n\nthe associated press noted that the stability of republicans' share of the latino vote frustrates democrats, who say actions like trump's family separation policy and his demonization of an immigrant caravan should drive latinos out of the gop.
the times of israel reports: u.s. president donald trump sent his peace envoy back to the middle east on tuesday in a move seen as a sign that he intends to make a push for a peace deal.\n\nthe envoy jason greenblatt met late tuesday with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas at a resort on the dead sea in jordan, which is hosting this week's arab league summit. abbas's spokesperson nabil abu rudeinah described it as a follow-up meeting to exchange ideas, according to the official pa news agency wafa. abbas heads to washington for his first meeting with the new president in the next few weeks.\n\ngreenblatt also met with a series of arab leaders and is expected to hold further talks on wednesday as the summit starts. ahead of those meetings, greenblatt met with european union foreign policy chief federica mogherini for talks focused on advancing the israel-palestinian track. it's a priority for both of us, he tweeted.\n\nread more here.
the algemeiner reports: jns.org – may 2017 set a monthly record for the number of tourists arriving in israel. since the start of 2017, tourism has infused $2.18 billion into the israeli economy, according to figures published thursday by israel's tourism ministry. the month of may saw 347,000 tourists enter israel, an increase of 16.7 percent from may 2016.\n\ntourism minister yariv levin attributed the tourism boom to the israeli government's marketing efforts.\n\nit's not a coincidence; it's a clear policy, he said. the positive trend that has continued for over six months is making a tremendous contribution to israeli employment and the economy, and i'm convinced that if we work correctly, we'll see this trend continue into the coming months.\n\nread more here.
finland's much-celebrated experiment in rolling out universal basic income (ubi), a proposed replacement for out-of-work benefits in post-industrial nations where all citizens are paid by the government regardless of their income, is to end as the local government seeks other alternatives to welfare reform.\n\nthe limited trial which began in 2017 selected 2,000 unemployed finns to receive a monthly payment of €560, regardless of whether they consequently found employment or not. rather than expand the experiment to more jobseekers, the finnish government has instead decided to let the trial expire at the end of 2018, signalling the end of the road in the nordic nation for ubi.\n\nthe bbc reports the remarks of finnish ubi designer professor olli kangas, who said: the eagerness of the government is evaporating. they rejected extra funding [for it]… i'm a little disappointed that the government decided not to expand it.\n\nthe exact reasons why finland decided not to extend the trial against the advice of professor kangas are not yet known and won't be revealed until after the project is completed in 2019, but the news will be a disappointment to many who saw ubi as a new and enhanced way force increased taxation levels and redistribute wealth.\n\nthe concept has proven popular with silicon valley elites, with the hyper-wealthy facebook ceo mark zuckerberg and tesla ceo elon musk, as well as slack ceo and flickr co-founder stewart butterfield joining together to endorse ubi in the united states, with zuckerberg stating giving all citizens tax money would give everyone a cushion to try new things.\n\nothers have argued that ubi will become necessary when increasing automation in the workplace renders some human work redundant, creating — it is claimed — mass-unemployment.\n\nyet findings by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) may hold some answers to the early end of finland's experiment — after the report showed that basic income paid by the government could actually increase inequality rather than solve it, and would require a 30 per cent income tax rise to pay for the policy.
manchester, n.h. (ap) — three days before the critical new hampshire primary, seven democratic presidential candidates debated, with many of them fighting to survive in the race to challenge president donald trump.\n\nhere are some key takeaways.\n\nmayor pete makes his case\n\npete buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of south bend., ind., was the candidate of the moment friday. all eyes were on him friday night to see if he could make his case.\n\nand he did — with one significant stumble.\n\nattacked for his thin resume, buttigieg shot back, if you're looking for the person with the most years of washington, d.c., experience under their belt, that candidate is not me. he promoted his youth compared with the lawmakers onstage talking their achievements from decades ago.\n\nwe cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, buttigieg said. we have to be ready to turn the page.\n\na former military intelligence officer, buttigieg seemed comfortable discussing foreign affairs, such as the trump administration's killing of iranian general qassem soleimani. there is no evidence that that made our country safer, he said, adding later, this is not an episode of '24.'\n\nbut buttigieg's trouble spot has long been race. asked about a spike in arrests of black people for marijuana possession in his city after he became mayor, buttigieg began to decry systemic racism but seemed to acknowledge he couldn't escape it in the city that he ran.\n\nsanders under attack\n\nit didn't take long for the candidates to make clear whom they saw as the front-runner. sen. bernie sanders of vermont was piled on by competitors fighting to become the moderate alternative to the self-declared democratic socialist.\n\nthere were two lines of attack — sanders' uncompromising liberal positions and, specifically, his proposal to immediately have the federal government take over the entire health care system.\n\nthe most notable punch was thrown by buttigieg, who said democrats will have a problem working to unite this country at a moment when we need unification when our nominee is dividing people. asked if he meant sanders, he said yes.\n\nminnesota sen. amy klobuchar scoffed at sanders' health care proposal. former vice president joe biden noted that sanders says he has no idea how much his proposal could cost, though experts have put it at at least $30 trillion.\n\nbut he showed a characteristic durability. in the deeply divided field, sanders is now leading in many polls by virtue of that following.\n\nbiden bounce back?\n\nafter his disappointing showing in iowa, biden was fighting to survive. sometimes it didn't seem like it, but biden also displayed flashes of the fire and emotion that have traditionally endeared him to democratic voters.\n\noffered a chance early to swing at his two main rivals — sanders and buttigieg — biden opened by basically admitting he was going to lose new hampshire.\n\nbernie won by 20 points last time, biden said softly. his criticisms of sanders and buttigieg weren't nearly as sharp as those offered by other candidates. biden's had difficulty talking about the gop investigation into his own son that triggered trump's impeachment and that has coincided with the former vice president's slide in the polls.\n\nthe former vice president was left asking the crowd to give a standing ovation to lt. col. alexander vindman, who was led out of the white house hours earlier. vindman had testified in december before democrats investigating trump's dealings with ukraine.\n\nbiden, 77, was more energized in the later hours of the debate. he was visibly enraged at trump's dismissive comments on u.s. casualties during the iranian retaliation for the u.s. killing of an iranian general. he sharply attacked sanders over the vermont senator's prior support for gun rights, defended his long record on the supreme court and promoted his historic support from african-americans.\n\nbut it's not clear whether his performance will quell worries.\n\nwarren didn't have a plan for breaking through\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren invested deeply in neighboring new hampshire as a key part of her 2020 run, but she struggled to find a standout moment as she begins to make her final case to the state's voters.\n\nwarren skipped a chance to differentiate herself more from sanders, a fellow progressive whom she calls a longtime friend. given the chance to create some distance, warren said, we have a lot of things in common, we have a lot of things that we differ on.\n\nshe quickly shifted to making a party unity plea and echoing her stump speech lines about big money in politics and corruption.\n\nwe bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, warren said. we're the democrats. we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and republicans on that. they hate the corruption as well.\n\nwarren also did little to explicitly come to sanders defense as her vermont rival was attacked by the more moderate candidates over his prized medicare for all policy goal, an idea warren supports.\n\nklobuchar made a mark\n\nklobuchar was quick with the quips as she tried gain an edge in the primary's moderate lane. she repeatedly made a virtue of her ability to compromise and work with republicans. there was an urgency to her presentation, with good reason: she needs an upset in new hampshire.\n\nshe hit familiar notes of criticizing medicare for all as she touted her midwestern appeal and legislative success in the senate. klobuchar's plea boiled down to making a case for democratic sensibility as a break from the smash-mouth nature of trump's presidency.\n\ni didn't come from money, klobuchar said, insisting voters want to have someone that they can understand in the white house.\n\nsteyer's fiery play … for south carolina\n\nbillionaire activist tom steyer does not have much of a chance in new hampshire. so he used the debate to make a strong appeal to african american voters in south carolina, where his campaign has invested heavily and black voters make up two-thirds of the primary electorate.\n\nthe billionaire noted that well into the debate, we have not said one word tonight about race.\n\nare you kidding me? he asked as a discussion of race ensued.\n\nhe added later, i am for reparations to african americans in this country and anyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.\n\nyang not burdened\n\nbusinessman andrew yang was not burdened by low expectations. he was at ease and having fun on the debate stage friday night, even though his chances to win new hampshire, let alone the democratic nomination, are minuscule.\n\nhe bounced onto the stage without a tie, in stark contrast to his more buttoned-up male rivals.\n\nbut yang was largely left out of the heated exchanges that simmered through the debate, focusing instead on stepping back and looking at the larger picture.\n\ndonald trump is not the cause of all of our problems, yang said. and we are making a mistake when we act like he is. he is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades.\n\nthe elephant not in the room\n\ntwo words were spoken friday night that have rarely come up on the trail or in prior debates: mike bloomberg.\n\nthe former new york mayor and multibillionaire is skipping the early nominating states and instead spending hundreds of millions on super tuesday states with far more delegates at stake.\n\na viewer-submitted question asked why the candidates were better than bloomberg.\n\ni don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the united states, warren said.\n\ni just simply don't think people look at the guy in the white house and say, 'can we get someone richer?' klobuchar said.\n\nthere are millions of people who can desire to run for office but i guess if you're worth $60 billion and you can spend several hundred millions of dollars on advertising you have a slight advantage, sanders said.\n\nthe responses were clear signals that they take bloomberg seriously.
british exports are at their strongest since 2010, according to a report by heathrow airport and the centre for economics and business research (cebr) — making a mockery of claims that post-referendum uncertainty would crash the economy.\n\nthe value of export goods destined for markets beyond the european union and switzerland have risen by some 150 per cent, with heathrow carrying £48.9 billion — or 30 per cent — of this cargo, city a.m. reports.\n\njohn holland-kaye, heathrow's chief executive officer, said that the figures proved that britain needs to secure its status as an outward-looking global trading nation — although he stopped short of calling out the eu loyalists in parliament seeking to tie britain to an eu customs deal which could see the bloc continuing to set britain's trade policy.\n\ntrade is so brisk, in fact, heathrow is operating at capacity, with holland-kaye claiming that the airport must expand so we can connect all corners of the uk to the growing markets of the world.\n\nbrexit boom: manufacturing set to outpace the rest of economy as exports surge https://t.co/4scfrgg0pd — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) march 5, 2018\n\nthe figures are just the latest nail in the already overcrowded coffin lid of the remain campaign's project fear, whose centrepiece was a treasury report warning voters that a leave vote would inflict an immediate and profound shock to the british economy, tipping the country into recession and putting hundreds of thousands out of work.\n\nin fact, the economy has continued to grow post-referendum, with factory output especially strong as the fall in sterling lets the air out of what princeton university academic ashoka mody described as a finance-property bubble and redirects economic activity towards manufacturing and exports.\n\nbreitbart london reported on march 5th that manufacturing growth is now expected to outpace the rest of the economy, with international firms such as siemens and unilever announcing multi-million-pound plants and research centres, expected to create thousands of new jobs.\n\nfollow jack montgomery on twitter: @jackbmontgomery
president-elect joe biden unveiled a coronavirus plan thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.\n\nthe proposal reflects the priorities of democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. it also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by democrats long before the pandemic struck.\n\nthe proposal includes:\n\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\n\n$170 billion for k-12 schools and institutions of higher education\n\ndirect payments of $1,400 to most americans, costing around $320 billion according to a breitbart news' estimate\n\nenhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of september\n\n$50 billion for covid-19 testing\n\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\n\nraising the child tax credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\n\nthe non-spending proposals include:\n\nhiking the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\n\nextending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of september\n\nextended family leave\n\ncalled the american rescue plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building american infrastructure.\n\nthose things will have to wait for a second bill that biden says will be introduced in february, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.\n\nthe proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. instead, it provides for what breitbart news estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most americans. biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill president donald trump signed last year.\n\nthe proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for k-12 schools and colleges.\n\nunder biden's multipronged strategy, only about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.\n\nbiden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.\n\nin an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. that is likely to make it harder for low-income americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.\n\nthe proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.\n\nthe political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. in a joint statement, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer praised biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. but democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of congress, and republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.\n\nremember that a bipartisan $900 billion #covid19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago, tweeted sen. john cornyn, r-texas.\n\nthe emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. aides said biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. inflation is below the federal reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.\n\nbiden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. our work begins with getting covid under control, he declared in his victory speech. we cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.\n\ndespite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.\n\nthe plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. so far, more than 385,000 people have died of covid-19 in the u.s. and government numbers out thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.\n\nabout $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by congress. biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.\n\nthe plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. about $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.\n\nthe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.\n\nthere's also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, and to help track new virus strains, including the more contagious variants identified in the united kingdom and south africa.\n\nthroughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.\n\nwith the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.\n\nbiden is asking americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. he contends it's still the surest way to slow the covid-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on tuesday.\n\nbiden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the american people to follow his lead, said dr. leana wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.\n\nwith the backing of congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.\n\nbiden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. the trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.\n\nthis is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said dr. nadine gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan trust for america's health. there is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.\n\nbiden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. the pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the american hospital association. wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.\n\nit's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. polls show it's particularly a problem among black americans. it's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said gracia.\n\nnext wednesday, when biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of covid-19 in the united states.\n\n___\n\nthe associated press and ap writer josh boak contributed to this report.
when it comes to setting policy in syria, secretary of state john kerry is not taken seriously and is laughed at in the larger middle east, breitbart jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter aaron klein stated in a radio interview on wednesday.\n\nklein was speaking during his weekly segment on john batchelor's popular national radio show.\n\nclick below to listen to klein's full segment on batchelor's program.\n\nklein, reporting from tel aviv, told batchelor that he heard the anti-kerry sentiment from diplomats in the region regarding u.s. policy in syria:\n\nwhat i'm hearing is that the middle east right now is entirely disappointed by john kerry, by the united states. there is no leadership. there is almost nothing being done on the american side. america has almost completely abandoned syria to russia; to what russia wants in the ceasefire agreement. … the united states has been largely absent. …\n\njohn kerry, by the way, is not taken seriously in the middle east and beyond. he's laughed at. there is no policy. he hasn't presented anything serious.\n\nkerry has been attempting to broker a ceasefire agreement in syria. but klein says it is russian president vladimir putin who has taken the leadership position in trying to arrange a vaguely-defined halt in hostilities scheduled to take effect saturday.\n\nthe guardian reported:\n\nthe russian president spoke by phone to leaders in iran, saudi arabia, israel, and syria in an attempt to garner support for the ceasefire, and explain its complex details.\n\nhe has also opened a coordination centre to which the warring parties can send complaints of specific breaches of the truce.\n\nthe truce will not apply to zones controlled by the islamic state and the al-qaeda-affiliated nusra front.\n\nhowever, klein said ceasefire efforts may be complicated by the assad regime's insistence on labeling rebel groups as terrorists.\n\nklein is not the only one mocking kerry's syria diplomacy. shadi hamid, a senior fellow at the brookings institute, was quoted stating, the only one holding out hope is john kerry.\n\nright now, it's hypothetical and not based on anything real. how kerry even explained it in his own words, it's hard to take seriously, hamid stated.\n\nklein, however, was speaking to what he said was the absence of a larger cohesive u.s. policy in syria.\n\non thursday, kerry cited previously unheard pentagon estimates essentially making public the dim chances of creating any future safe-zone or no-fly-zone in syria.\n\nabc news reported:\n\nkerry said today that creating a safe zone isn't as simple as it sounds. in addition to controlling the airspace, kerry said, a large troop presence would be required to shield the population from isis attacks on the ground.\n\nall this talk about safe zones does not go through the process of what it really means, kerry said.\n\nour pentagon estimates that to have a true safe zone in the north of the country you may have upwards of fifteen to thirty thousand troops. now are we ready to authorize that? are we ready to put them on the ground?\n\naside from the inherent physical and political risks of putting a large number of u.s. troops on the ground inside syria, the u.s. worries about potential conflicts with russia, which is also conducting an aerial bombing campaign over syria.\n\ncreating a no-fly zone would most likely mean the u.s. would have to enforce that rule against russian jets – a potentially dangerous scenario.\n\nnevertheless, kerry said that the u.s. is considering other options if a ceasefire can't be reached inside syria.
las vegas (ap) — as early voting surged in nevada's nominating contest, former vice president joe biden lashed out at democratic rival bernie sanders on saturday for not doing enough to control his most aggressive supporters.\n\nbiden's attack during an interview for nbc's meet the press came as he fights to rescue his struggling presidential bid and sanders works to strengthen his strong standing with the contest speeding into a new phase. biden also sought to downplay expectations for next saturday's nevada caucuses, telling reporters that he did not need to win.\n\nin the interview, the former vice president seized on reports that sanders' supporters insulted and made online threats against leaders of an influential union that declined to endorse any of the eight candidates still in the democratic race.\n\nhe may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability, biden charged. he continued: if any of my supporters did that, i'd disown them … flat disown them.\n\nthe sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about biden's assertion.\n\nearlier saturday, the fiery progressive senator went on the offensive against his moderate competitors for accepting campaign cash from billionaires, although he declined to go after his opponents by name.\n\ndemocracy is not candidates going to the homes of billionaires raising money, sanders charged during a rally at a suburban las vegas high school.\n\nboth biden and pete buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in seattle at roughly the same time sanders made the comments.\n\nit was a familiar line of attack in a relatively unfamiliar setting as the 2020 primary contest descended upon nevada for a weekend of frenzied campaigning, colored by mobile campaign billboards cruising the las vegas strip and a diverse set of voters weighing in for the first time.\n\nwhile the state's formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. state party officials at some sites across nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.\n\nin northern nevada's washoe county, a line of more than 300 people snaked through aisles of book shelves at a public library as another 100 queued up at the county party's headquarters. dozens left without voting.\n\na spokeswoman for the nevada democrats, molly forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after iowa's presidential caucuses turned disastrous.\n\nwe are happy to see the number of energized democrats participating in our first ever early voting period, forgey said, noting that early voters have four days to participate. our volunteers and staff are working to make every site runs as efficiently as possible and to ensure every voter gets to make their voice heard.\n\nearly votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on feb. 22, when democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. the nevada state democratic party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.\n\namid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the las vegas-based clark county democratic party to feature a half-dozen white house hopefuls.\n\nbiden, looking to nevada's diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in iowa and new hampshire, seized on president donald trump's hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.\n\neverybody knows how donald trump is. we gotta let him know who we are, biden said, drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a las vegas middle school gymnasium for a latino organizing event.\n\nbiden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. he later told reporters that he didn't need to win nevada's caucuses to mount a comeback.\n\ni just have to do well, the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. asked whether he has to win, he replied, no, i don't think i have to, but i think we have a shot at winning.\n\nformer sen. harry reid, an icon in nevada's democratic politics, told reporters that people should not be counting joe biden out of the race yet, but also offered warm words for sanders' candidacy. when asked he downplayed concerns from some democrats that sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.\n\ni care a great deal about bernie sanders. and he has gotten where he has by having people support him, said the 80-year-old reid. and so i'm not going to be critical of bernie sanders.\n\nelizabeth warren, meanwhile, also reeling after a weak performance last week in new hampshire, looked to nevada's women for momentum.\n\nthe massachusetts senator pitched her universal childcare plan as she addressed about 30 people, mostly women, at a downtown las vegas reggae and cocktail bar. after being introduced by actress yvette nicole brown, warren said her childcare plan would be paid for by a wealth tax of 2 cents on every dollar for fortunes of more than $50 million.\n\nit's good for our babies, warren said. think about what it means for every mama. every mama who can now finish her education, even if she's just had a baby. every mama and every daddy who could take a job.\n\nmike bloomberg, who isn't competing in nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for wednesday's presidential debate in la vegas. the billionaire businessman and former new york mayor has increasingly become a target of the democratic party's far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.\n\nboth warren and sanders criticized the role of big money in politics and billionaires seeking the presidency. bloomberg and tom steyer are in that category.\n\ndemocracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice, sanders declared.\n\nthe campaign of bloomberg, who campaigned saturday in virginia, announced the opening of seven new campaign offices in florida, bringing the total to 10. the former new york mayor has more than 2,000 paid staff spread out across the nation and has already spent over $300 million on tv, radio and digital advertising, according to the ad tracking firm

the department of homeland security (dhs) is releasing from custody more than 2,000 border-crossing adults and the children they arrived with over the course of a few weeks.\n\na dhs official confirmed to breitbart news that the u.s. border patrol and the immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency is releasing more than 2,000 family units caught at the u.s.-mexico border, citing a lack of detention space.\n\nthe border-crossing adults and the children they arrived at the border with will be released and given a court date for an immigration hearing. the adults will be given ankle monitors, though the dhs official says the process of keeping track of border-crossers via ankle monitors is not effective.\n\nborder patrol and ice are experiencing major issues with detention space at the yuma, arizona sector of the border, as well as in san diego, california, el paso, texas, and the rio grande valley sector of the southern border.\n\nthe dhs official said there is not nearly enough bed space for family units at border detention facilities, while border patrol encounters about 2,100 border-crossers a day with more than 60 percent of those adults bringing children with them in the hope to be quickly released into the interior of the country.\n\nphotos captured over the last couple of weeks reveal the mass release of border-crossing family units by dhs:\n\na dhs spokesperson blamed the country's immigration loophole, known as the flores settlement agreement, in a statement to breitbart news.\n\nwe are living through an immigration crisis that is in part driven by a disastrous ruling by a district court judge in the ninth circuit that incentives illegal alien adults to put their children in the hands of smugglers and traffickers, waldman told breitbart news in a statement. the flores settlement agreement has created an immigration loophole that rewards parents for bringing their children with them to the united states.\n\nthe flores settlement agreement — to which the president trump's administration has demanded an end — requires border-crossing family units to be released after 20 days, even before their immigration hearing. the result is a growing illegal alien population, as less than two percent of border-crossing family units are deported.\n\nsince 2015, we have seen a 169 percent increase in family units crossing the border. there has been a 110 percent increase in males traveling with children over the last two years, waldman said. as long as activist judges continue to set national immigration policy they continue to put family units and innocent children in harm's way.\n\nas the trump administration mass releases border-crossing family units, illegal immigration continues surging at the southern border. breitbart news's bob price reports that about 22,000 border-crossing minors crossed the border last month.\n\nin november 2018, there were close to 52,000 border crossings on the southern border, alone, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of november since 2006. projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade.
international human rights lawyer anne bayefsky reported on un ambassador nikki haley's latest statement about the un human rights council on tuesday's breitbart news daily. bayefsky expressed disappointment with the mild character of haley's brief remarks, compared to the boldness of her earlier criticism of the council.\n\ni'm afraid that she didn't say very much. she was very hopeful. her attitude was one of hope that the human rights council would do a better job going forward, bayefsky said of haley's remarks.\n\nit was a very short speech. you get very little time at the human rights council to speak, so she couldn't say very much of anything, she noted.\n\nshe might have said that unless the council does a, b, c, the united states will remove itself, but she didn't say that. she said that venezuela should voluntarily step down, which of course is completely and utterly unrealistic. she said no human rights violator should be on the council, should be allowed to take a seat. that isn't going to happen because the general assembly and the council itself determines who are its members, and they have no intention of changing their procedures, bayefsky noted.\n\nand she said it's essential that the council address its anti-israel bias, but again, u.s. ambassadors to the united nations have said that for the last three decades, to no avail. there was no 'or else,' she said.\n\nsiriusxm host joel pollak noted that haley's hopeful tone was not dramatically different from the obama administration's attitude when it decided to improve the human rights council by re-joining it and working from within. he asked if those years of effort had produced any positive changes.\n\nthat's a good question, bayefsky replied. first of, they didn't 'rejoin' because president bush had never joined. it was created in 2006. obama, it was one of his very first foreign policy moves to join it, to lend it credibility. he left president trump holding the bag because he ran the united states for a three-year term that began only on january 1, 2017, hoping to essentially rule from the grave. so they were faced with an issue of whether to get off it from the get-go at the trump administration, and they didn't.\n\nthe obama administration made very specific reform efforts to a) change the composition so that countries like saudi arabia and so on were not members, and secondly they attempted to change the entrenched anti-israel bias. they failed miserably on both counts, she said.\n\nto see ambassador haley raise this as a potential viable reform effort is unfortunate because she's playing a shell game. she doesn't have the votes, the united states doesn't have the votes. the procedures don't permit those kinds of reforms. there is a complete lack of political will, and it isn't going to happen, bayefsky contended.\n\nthe current situation is that the council is collecting a blacklist of american and other companies doing business with the state of israel, and when we're on it, the american taxpayer is paying for that blacklist. it's shameful. we shouldn't be anywhere granting the kind of legitimacy that the leader of the free world brings to the table at the human rights council, she urged.\n\nit is possible to still go there and give speeches, non-members can still do that, even co-sponsor resolutions, she noted. but to lend our money and our clout, in terms of membership, is completely inexcusable.\n\npollak asked for president trump's options, if he decides not to wait until america's three-year membership in the human rights council expires.\n\nhe could withdraw tomorrow, bayefsky replied, noting with a chuckle that the deadline for withdrawing today has passed. he has very clear options. he could say, 'the united states taxpayer is no longer going to pay for this travesty that builds equality rights on the backs of inequality of jews. we're going to get off now.' that's the first option.\n\noption number two is to play the reform game, which the un enjoys, and has enjoyed for a very long time, she continued. which simply perpetrates a fraud. i can't put it in any other way. they're not going to do the major reforms necessary – changing of composition and removing of the anti-israel bias.\n\nbayefsky said the trump administration could play that reform game until the cows come home, and then simply allow membership in the human rights council to lapse when the current term expires.\n\nthat would have lent the council another three years of legitimacy, which they don't deserve, she said. and it's not just that. their demonization of the state of israel is leading to what we see as anti-israel bias on college campuses. it gives a license to the bds, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions regime. it isn't cost-free, and i think that's what we have to understand.\n\nengagement and the way nikki haley has legitimized the council by going there and giving it that kind of cachet of a u.s. un ambassador who never goes to geneva, it's a very unusual move. it has a downside. it simply isn't cost-free. we are now legitimizing it, and every moment we're still there, we're doing the same thing, she cautioned.\n\nbreitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. eastern.
president donald trump's administration issued a formal veto threat to democrats in congress, vowing to oppose their government funding bill without border security.\n\nin a statement from the office of management and budget, the administration wrote that they cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the nation's urgent border security needs.\n\ntrump has demanded that any bill funding the government include $5.6 billion for border security.\n\nthe white house noted that the house democrat spending bill also undermined the president's mexico city policy, an executive order that trump imposed to bar taxpayer funds from subsidizing overseas abortions. the house bill also included funding for the west bank/gaza strip as well as syria and pakistan and certain united nations funds, which the administration said were frozen or under review during the trump administration.\n\nthe administration looks forward to working with the congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the american people as soon as possible, the statement read.\n\ndemocrats took power on thursday in the house of representatives, electing nancy pelosi as the new speaker of the house. they planned to pass two bills to fund the government, although senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has refused to take up the bills without trump's approval.
airbnb announced on monday that it would be reviewing reservations in the washington dc area ahead of the presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. the company is also cross-referencing arrest records from the capitol hill incident with its customer base to ban attendees from using the platform in the future.\n\ncbs news reports that the online rental marketplace airbnb has announced plans to review reservations in the washington dc area ahead of next week's presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. the decision comes shortly after city officials asked airbnb, vrbo, and other rental hosts to remove listings until the january 20 inauguration is over.\n\nwashington city council member janeese lewis george said in a twitter post: there's no way to guarantee that your guests are not coming to incite violence. please protect your neighbors and the district from more attacks.\n\nairbnb has had a policy of removing guests that are confirmed to be members of hate groups since 2017 after the company blocked guests who were traveling to a white supremacist rally in charlottesville, virginia.\n\nairbnb stated that it will warn all guests in the washington area that it may bring legal action against them if they are found to be members of a hate group or planning violent activities. hosts are also encouraged to call a hotline if they suspect guests are violating airbnb policies.\n\nairbnb also announced that anyone who engaged in criminal activity in last week's protest at the u.s. capitol will be banned from the platform. airbnb is reportedly cross-referencing arrest records to determine who should be removed from the platform but has not yet stated how many have been banned.\n\nthe company also stated it will not give political donations to republicans who voted against certifying the results of the election last week, joining marriot, at&t, and others in taking that stance. airbnb's political action committee donated $866,519 to candidates and political parties in the 2020 election cycle, according to open secrets. joe biden was the biggest recipient of airbnb donations.\n\nlucas nolan is a reporter for breitbart news covering issues of free speech and online censorship. follow him on twitter @lucasnolan or contact via secure email at the address lucasnolan@protonmail.com
house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff indicated during his opening remarks at the senate impeachment trial wednesday that lawmakers must remove president donald trump from office to avoid his reelection in november, claiming that we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.\n\nechoing other democrats, schiff indicated that democrats are trying to impeach and remove trump from office to avoid his winning a second term.\n\nschiff declared:\n\nas we will discuss, impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise and without urgency at the ballot box. instead, we are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election. for precisely this reason, the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won:\n\nimpeach him or else he'll win kinda gives the game away https://t.co/gdl9xi7fmf — ben mcdonald (@bmac0507) january 23, 2020\n\nschiff served as the chief impeachment inquiry inquisitor in the house. now, he is one of seven managers arguing the case for convicting and removing trump in the ongoing senate trial.\n\nthis week, he argued that if the senate rejects democrats' demands for more witnesses, trump will be considered guilty despite the verdict reached by the republican-controlled senate.
claim: sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) claimed during tuesday night's democrat debate that he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world.\n\nverdict: mostly false. sanders has repeatedly praised communism in cuba, china, and nicaragua, with weak caveats acknowledging that they are authoritarian regimes.\n\nsanders aggressively denied supporting authoritarian regimes when asked to justify comments made repeatedly this week praising cuban dictator fidel castro's literacy campaigns, indoctrination plans that forced children to read communist propaganda and worship mass murderers like ernesto che guevara. sanders never mentioned in his prior supportive comments that cuba had an extremely high literacy rate before the 1959 communist revolution that did not necessitate the alleged literacy programs.\n\ni have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, sanders insisted on tuesday. of course you have a dictatorship in cuba, what i said is what barack obama said … that cuba made progress on education.\n\nsanders then proceeded to yell at the crowd, which booed his support for communism.\n\nreally? literacy programs are bad? sanders asked.\n\noccasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy, that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world, sanders continued, without explaining what his claims of american meddling in iran and chile had to do with fidel castro's childhood indoctrination schemes.\n\nafter insisting he has opposed authoritarianism consistently, he then defended authoritarianism on the debate stage.\n\nwhen dictatorships, whether it is the chinese or the cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, he said, over the unintelligible shouts of several other candidates on the stage.\n\ni have condemned authoritarianism … authoritarianism of any stripe is bad, but that is different than to say that governments on occasion do things that are good, sanders concluded.\n\nin the comments that sanders defended on the stage – offered to anderson cooper on 60 minutes sunday – the socialist senator applauded cuba and condemned those who criticized castro for saying everything is bad.\n\nwe're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of cuba but, you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad. you know? when fidel castro came into office, you know what he did? he had a massive literacy program. is that a bad thing? even though fidel castro did it? he asked.\n\non monday, sanders offered a similar defense on cnn.\n\n[w]hen fidel castro first came to power he initiated a major literacy program. there [were] a lot of folks in cuba at that point who were illiterate, and he formed a literacy brigade … they went out and they helped people learn to read and write, sanders said. you know what? i think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. i have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world … but, you know, you can't say — china is another example. china is an authoritarian country, becoming more and more authoritarian. but can anyone deny — i mean, the facts are clear, that they have taken more people out of extreme poverty than any country in history.\n\nsanders did not offer his authoritarian caveats in the 1980s remarks that prompted the 60 minutes interview question on cuba.\n\nyou may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the castro was the worst guy in the world. all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro, sanders said at the time. they had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\n\ngranma, the official state newspaper of the cuban communist party, approvingly translated sanders' comments for an article tuesday applauding him as today one of the strongest aspirants to the democrat party nomination to the november presidential election.\n\nfollow frances martel on facebook and twitter.
as the presidential race shifts into high gear, college students and recent graduates are still being largely ignored, except by one candidate whose promises of rainbows and unicorns are dreams – not reality.\n\nas the smartest and, possibly, poorest generation in our nation's history, millennials will soon have their day of reckoning. here are the key issues threatening our generation, that we hope the next administration will tackle, so that we, too, can live the american dream.\n\n1. colleges are robbing students.\n\ncollege tuition costs have skyrocketed by over 500 percent since 1985. as long as schools continue to tell young people that a degree will guarantee them a better future, they'll keep footing the bill. the government helps them load up on debt – and leaves them with little to no help after the fact.\n\n2. to get a job in america you need to spend money you don't have.\n\noutstanding student loan debt has reached a staggering $1.2 trillion, with over 70 percent of ba degree graduates borrowing to pay for college. some 21 million students now each owe an average of $29,400. what's worse, students have rack up all that debt even for jobs that pay $10 an hour. good luck working that off.\n\n3. that $200,000 degree may not be worth the paper it's printed on.\n\ncollege students graduating today are more likely to work a low-wage job that doesn't require a college degree – the worst imbalance since at least 1990, according to the federal reserve.\n\neven worse, the average median earnings for the class of 2013 was the lowest since 1980, adjusting for inflation.\n\n4. we're kept financially illiterate by a broken education system.\n\none of the most indebted generations in american history is also the least equipped to manage its debt. only 24 percent of millenials qualify as financially literate, according to pwc and half expect that they wouldn't be able to handle an emergency bill of $2,000.\n\nfew colleges and fewer high schools teach pocketbook economics. no wonder we're slaves to the system.\n\n5. the government puts up roadblocks to starting our own businesses.\n\ndespite the majority of millennials and college students indicating that they want to start their own business at some point, the number of actual entrepreneurs is going down. the share of new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 and 34 declined by 12% when compared to the same demographic in 1996.\n\naccording to the manhattan institute, one of the biggest barriers to new business creation among those under 30 is the mountain of federal, state and local regulations.\n\nwithout modernizing government regulations to encourage new startups, we're likely to see entrepreneurship continue to decline. we'll also have less chances of making money driving an uber or renting out a room on airbnb, as the taxi and hotel industries and regulators crack down on innovation.\n\n6. not only does government stop us from working, it takes what little cash we may have.\n\npoliticians use millennials to pay for programs such as social security and medicare that would otherwise be insolvent. the amount of debt held by the public will be more that 79 percent of gdp by 2024, when millennials will make up most of the labor force. to pay for that debt, taxes will have to rise.\n\nthe think tank demos calls this generational theft.\n\n7. of course, in the end, politicians don't care about us. we're, um, fkd.\n\na survey from genfkd confirms our suspicions: presidential candidates don't discuss the issues important to america's largest eligible voting demographic, millennials.\n\nwhen asked whether or not the presidential candidates were addressing the issues close to them, roughly 86 percent, all aged 18 to 34, reported feeling ignored.\n\nwhat now?\n\nif grandma and grandpa wonder why today's kids are angry, they may need to look at the economic policies that have us trapped. today's political candidates need to:\n\nlay out realistic and viable plans to boost job growth;\n\noverhaul last century's regulations,\n\nstop ripping us off to pay for the generations that stand in front of us;\n\nlet us get on with our careers, our business ideas and our dreams\n\nor maybe they want us to believe pigs can fly.\n\njustin dent is the co-founder and policy and director at genfkd. justin grew up in new york city and studies agricultural resource economics and government at the university of maryland.
newly-installed rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) is calling for 70% taxation on the wealthy as a way to pay for her green new deal, which proposes to use government to create new jobs by investing in renewable energy.\n\nin an interview set to air sunday on cbs news' 60 minutes, ocasio-cortez — who has begun referring to herself by the nickname, aoc — told anderson cooper that the green new deal would require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, including raising taxes to a marginal rate of 70%, as in the 1960s.\n\naoc referred to the 70% rate on people at the tippy-tops as the rich merely paying their fair share of the tax burden.\n\nshe compared the green new deal to other radical policies like president abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation, and president franklin delano roosevelt launching social security in the new deal.\n\nas breitbart news has noted, the green new deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by president barack obama's green jobs czar, van jones. it seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.\n\nto that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. aoc herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the united states moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.\n\nin comparison, california — the most ambitious state in green energy policy — has merely set itself a goal of 100% renewables by 2045, more than 25 years away.\n\nobama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company solyndra, which failed after obama, vice president joe biden, and others held it up as a model.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
branden river high school in bradenton, florida, could make bras officially mandatory for female students following a controversy surrounding one of their students who was forced to put band-aids over her nipples after showing up for class without a bra on under her shirt.\n\nin an attempt to address the situation, the school said it would change its dress code next year to make bras mandatory for all female students, reported the washington times, who added that the american civil liberties union (aclu) stepped in this week to defend the choice of students who don't want to wear a bra, saying the school's threat to impose a mandatory bra policy for girls amount to sex discrimination.\n\nin a statement, the aclu declared, a school's dress code cannot make generalizations about what types of clothing or appearance are appropriate for a boy or a girl to wear to school. unfortunately, we often see gender stereotypes and discrimination play a prolific role in the enforcement of school dress codes across the country.\n\nlast month, 17-year-old lizzy martinez recounted her experience with the school.\n\nshe told me that i needed to put a shirt on under my long-sleeve shirt to try to tighten my breasts — to constrict them, claimed martinez. and then she asked me to move around.\n\nmartinez was then sent to the school nurse, who gave her four band-aids to put over her nipples, which reportedly caused martinez to break down in tears and leave school early.\n\naccording to the bradenton herald, martinez is organizing a bracott against the school.\n\ncharlie nash is a reporter for breitbart tech. you can follow him on twitter @mrnashington, or like his page at facebook.
corporations should be encouraged to support gay rights as a means to further economic gain, attendees at the world economic forum in davos will hear this week.\n\nworld leaders gather this week at the swiss ski resort to discuss how to make globalism more inclusive in response to the rising tide of populism.\n\nas part of that agenda chief operating officer of the thomson reuters foundation antonio zappulla has suggested private and public sector leaders be encouraged to be more inclusive of lgbt staff.\n\nsingling out organisations who have been leading on that agenda for praise, zappulla cited the british intelligence agency, mi5, as an example of the progress made over the last decade.\n\nmi5, the uk's national counter-intelligence agency, currently ranks as stonewall's top employer of the year: a remarkable achievement when you think that until the early 90s, lgbt people were altogether banned from working at the british intelligence services, he wrote.\n\nstarbucks, too, was also lauded as a company in touch with current lgbt culture, as evidenced by its advert featuring drag queens bianca del rio and adore delano, while starbucks's ceo howard schultz gained applause from zappulla for famously [putting] his money where his mouth is by telling a shareholder who opposed the company's vocal support for gay marriage to invest elsewhere.\n\nexamples such as these are good p.r., but they're also good for an organisation's bottom line, zappulla argues.\n\na report by out now estimates the us economy could add an extra $9 billion a year if companies improved their ability to retain lgbt talent through the implementation of inclusive policies. countries where such policies do not exist are missing out: the world bank estimates india is losing $32 billion a year in economic output precisely because of widespread discrimination against lgbt people.\n\nthe numbers are clear: there is an economic case for lgbt inclusion, and it's strong, he insists.\n\ncompanies with strong lgbt policies tend to innovate the most, to have loyal employees, and to experience significantly less [sic] cases of discrimination lawsuits. in addition to that, they are also positively perceived by their customers. it's a win-win.\n\nhowever, he acknowledges that furthering lgbt interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge. his answer is to think and act 'glocally': underscoring the business benefits of diversity locally, and adopting global policies that make the workplace safe, fair and accepting for all.\n\nzappulla's agenda contribution comes as the world economic forum releases its inclusive growth and development report 2017, arguing that countries' economic development should not be judged on gdp alone, but on social participation.\n\naccording to the authors, the report, which covers 109 economies, seeks to improve our understanding of how countries can use a diverse spectrum of policy incentives and institutional mechanisms to make economic growth more socially inclusive without dampening incentives to work, save and invest.\n\nafter ranking the countries based on twelve key performance indicators of inclusive development including poverty, two inequality measures, and carbon intensity, norway came out at the top of the list, followed by luxembourg, switzerland, iceland, denmark, sweden, and the netherlands.\n\nthe united kingdom was ranked 21st, while the united states was in 23rd place.\n\nthe authors hope to inspire a coordinated international initiative to raise median living standards, in part through the replacement of free trade deals with the facilitation of trade by encouraging convergence around best practices and standards to reduce frictions and boost development.
german government ministers have agreed on the outline of a new law, which, if passed, would make it easier to deport immigrants who break german laws.\n\nwe will tighten criminal law to make deportation easier, said justice minister heiko maas.\n\nthe new proposal would lower that threshold to pursue deportation such that any immigrant convicted of a crime with a jail sentence longer than one year would be eligible. in addition, specific crimes which will be looked at as cause for deportation include sexual assault, threatening someone's life, or attacking a police officer. currently, these crimes usually result in probation and thus, do not result in deportation.\n\nchancellor angela merkel, who has been under pressure since news of the assaults in cologne broke last week, said of the proposal, we must make sure the law can take effect as soon as possible. merkel supported an open border policy that led to over one million new immigrants entering the county, primarily from northern africa and the middle east.\n\non new year's eve, as many as 1,000 drunk men, identified by victims and police as mostly immigrants, filled the plaza outside the train station in cologne and sexually assaulted passing women. a total of 553 police reports have been filed with law enforcement in cologne, germany, based on incidents that took place on new year's eve. the bbc reports 45% of those–about 250 reports–allege sexual assault on women.\n\ndespite the complete breakdown in public order, the police report published january 1 claimed the previous night had been relaxed and peaceful. it was only a week later that word of what had really happened began to make its way into newspapers.\n\na leaked police report described the scene as chaos, with police completely unable to restore order or protect women being attacked. one direct result of the fiasco came last week; cologne's police chief was ordered to take an early retirement.
in recent weeks, the boy scouts of america announced the organization would admit girls to take part in its programs. and now, charisma news reports that condoms will be made available for its 2019 world scout jamboree in west virginia and alcohol permitted in some areas.\n\ncharisma news reported:\n\nthe guidelines require that host organizations, who in this case include the former boy scouts of america (now scouts bsa), … ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and ist [staff] at a number of locations on the site. heads of contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their participants, unit leaders, contingent staff, and ist in an appropriate way. (see guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) stunningly, the world jamboree guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event. (it appears the jamboree guidelines were drafted after the 2015 world jamboree in japan in preparation for the 2019 event and were just recently released in an email.)\n\nthe theme for next summer's jamboree is unlock a new world and will celebrate cultural exchange, mutual understanding, peace, and friendship, charisma news reported.\n\nthe scouts have defended their recent decision to admit girls, citing inclusivity.\n\nthe program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted eagle scout award, the associated press (ap) reported.\n\nthe new world market is the only source for your official 24th world #scoutjamboree merchandise and swag! today, we're… posted by 24th world scout jamboree – north america 2019 on friday, april 20, 2018\n\nap has reported that the boy scouts have been for boys and young men only for more than 100 years.\n\nbut in early may, a new name was announced to reflect the decision to admit girls: scouts bsa. the change will become effective in february 2019.\n\nchief scout executive mike surbaugh said many possibilities were considered during lengthy and 'incredibly fun' deliberations before the new name was chosen, ap reported.\n\nwe wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward, surbaugh said. we're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and young women.\n\nthe parent organization will remain the boy scouts of america, and the cub scouts — its program for 7- to 10-year-olds — will keep its title, as well, ap reported. but the boy scouts — the program for 11- to 17-year-olds — will now be scouts bsa.\n\nthe girls scouts issued a statement about the boy scouts' decision to admit girls by touting what makes its organization uniquely suited for girls.\n\ngirl scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, sylvia acevedo, ceo of girl scouts of the usa, said in the statement. we are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills, explore stem and the outdoors, participate in community projects, and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults.\n\nwe're also dedicated to building that critical stem workforce pipeline that businesses and communities across the country are looking for, acevedo said. girls are our country's great untapped resource and are the key to our nation's competitive advantage in the new digital economy we're living in.\n\nthey'll be the drivers and the designers of our industries of the future, filling and creating jobs that don't even exist yet, acevedo said. and at girl scouts, we're preparing them for these opportunities.\n\nthe 24th world scout jamboree will be held july 22 to august 2, 2019.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter.
president trump is seeking to halt the flow of birth tourism, the practice of foreign visitors arriving in the united states only to secure their u.s.-born children birthright american citizenship, by issuing a new regulation for state department officials.\n\nevery year, as breitbart news reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 u.s.-born children, commonly referred to as anchor babies, who secure birthright american citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000.\n\na new rule issued by the trump administration states that consular officers who grant b-1 and b-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, must deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on u.s. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship.\n\nthe department does not believe that visiting the united states for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the united states — an activity commonly referred to as 'birth tourism' — is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, for purposes of consular officers adjudicating applications for b nonimmigrant visas, the state department regulation states.\n\nan official with the white house said the rule is not only to enhance national security, but also to protect american taxpayers from being forced to subsidize the medical costs of foreign nationals solely trying to secure american citizenship for their u.s.-born children:\n\nthe birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in federal prosecutions. closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the united states from the national security risks created by this practice. it will also defend american taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism. [emphasis added]\n\nthe rule will codify in federal statute a requirement that b visa-holders prove they can pay the full costs associated with any medical treatment they are seeking in the u.s. as opposed to current policy, consular officers will be ordered to presume that a pregnant national seeking a b visa is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for the child.\n\nthe integrity of american citizenship must be protected, a white house official said.\n\nstate department officials have said foreign nationals seeking b visas are increasingly stating during the application process that they are traveling to the u.s. to give birth to their children.\n\nthe majority of beneficiaries of birth tourism arrive in the u.s. from china and russia, two nations that are not visa waiver countries, meaning their nationals do not have instant temporary access to come to the u.s.\n\na white house official told breitbart news that nationals arriving from the 39 visa waiver countries, including south korea, singapore, poland, and taiwan, are not subject to this new rule.\n\nto date, the u.s. supreme court has never explicitly ruled that the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic american citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.\n\nmany leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.\n\nfor almost two years, trump has signaled that he has reviewed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, otherwise known as the anchor baby policy. that executive order, though, has yet to come up for consideration.\n\ntoday, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the u.s. under 18, exceeding the annual roughly four million american babies born every year and costing american taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.\n\njohn binder is a reporter for breitbart news. follow him on twitter at @jxhnbinder.
the house committee on science space and technology released a report on thursday detailing how russia has been using social media platforms to disrupt domestic energy markets and influence domestic energy policies.\n\nthe 21-page report includes russian posts on twitter, facebook, and instagram, some with photographs and slogans.\n\nthe committee began investigating russian attempts to influence u.s. energy markets in the summer of 2017 when chairman [lamar] smith wrote [to] the secretary of treasury regarding russia's intricate money-laundering scheme. russian-sponsored agents funneled money to u.s. environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets, the report states.\n\nupon discovering that russia may have exploited american social media platforms to accomplish its disruptive objectives, the committee broadened the scope of its investigation, the report outlines. on september 26, 2017, the committee requested data from facebook and twitter as part of this expanded investigation.\n\nthe documents social media companies provided to the committee confirm russia's influence peddling, according to the report.\n\nthe report also includes an article posted on the buzzfeed news website that revealed how the russians used instagram to influence native americans on oil and gas pipelines, including the dakota access pipeline, the site of native american protests.\n\nsmith requested more information about russian actvity from social media companies last october, according to the report.\n\nthe committee received and reviewed the companies' produced documents for evidence of russian influence, the report states. twitter, facebook, and instagram were able to identify russian accounts linked to the internet research agency (ira), a russian company based in saint petersburg established by the russian government for the purpose of deceptively using various social and traditional media platforms to advance russian propaganda.\n\nthe information received from twitter, facebook, and instagram shows that russian agents indeed sought to disrupt u.s. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy by exploiting american social media platforms, the report states.\n\nsome of the key findings of the report include:\n\n• between 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 9,097 russian posts or tweets regarding u.s. energy policy or a current energy event on twitter, facebook, and instagram.\n\nbetween 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 4,334 ira accounts across twitter, facebook, and instagram.\n\naccording to information provided by twitter, more than four percent of all ira tweets were related to energy or environmental issues, a significant portion of content when compared to the eight percent of ira tweets that were related to the election in the u.s.\n\nthe ira targeted pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy in the u.s.\n\nthe report also reveals that russia wants to disrupt the cutting edge technology that has resulted in an american domestic energy renaissance, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\n\nhorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as a means for producing oil and natural gas began in the early 2000s, the report states. at that time, there were approximately 26,000 hydraulically fractured wells in the united states, which accounted for 'less than 7%' of all u.s. marketed natural gas. by 2011, fracking had become the primary method for oil and natural gas development in the united states.\n\nsince 2014, fracked wells have 'accounted for most of all new wells drilled and completed,' the report states. the number of fracked wells had climbed 'to an estimated 300,000' by 2015, and were responsible for approximately 67 percent of all u.s. natural gas output.\n\nin january 2017, the office of the director of national intelligence released a report that contained clear evidence that the kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the united states, the report states.\n\nthe report also highlights how u.s. energy exports reaching the global marketplace is a threat to russia's dominance in some of those markets. for example, according to the report, poland recently signed a five-year agreement with the united states to import liquefied natural gas into the country in an attempt to decrease dependency on russian energy supplies.\n\nclimate change is also an issue the russians are exploiting on social media, according to the report.\n\nnumerous russian posts focused on the ongoing debate about climate change by linking catastrophic weather events to climate change and divisively labeling one viewpoint as right and one as left, the report states. one post characterizes americans as ignoring major events that are allegedly signs of climate change. additionally, these posts frame the conservative viewpoint regarding climate change as a 'liberal hoax, all in an effort to generate further domestic controversy surrounding the issue of climate change.\n\nthe report concludes:\n\nthe committee will continue its ongoing efforts to identify foreign interference in domestic energy policy, whether from russia or any other country so that the american people can formulate their positions based on facts rather than foreign propaganda.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter
hungarian prime minister viktor orbán said thursday that french president emmanuel macron is the champion of europe's pro-immigration forces and therefore he has a duty to oppose him.\n\nthere is no denying that emmanuel macron is an important figure, in fact, the leader of the pro-immigration forces, mr. orbán told a press conference in budapest.\n\nresponding to a question from le monde, the prime minister said that he has good relations with macron, but when it comes to views of migration, the two are on opposite sides.\n\nit is nothing personal, but a matter of our countries' futures, orbán noted.\n\nif what he wants with regards to migration takes place in europe, that would be bad for hungary, therefore i must fight him, he said.\n\nmr. orbán said he hopes that parties committed to curbing illegal immigration will win a majority in the european parliament elections next may, in order to modify the current policy of the eu executive.\n\nhe also denounced the policy of chancellor angela merkel and the attitude of the german media, which are constantly pushing for europe to welcome more and more migrants, in opposition to the will of the hungarian people.\n\non that, there is no compromise possible, he insisted. german politics does not respect the hungarians' decision not to become an immigrant nation.\n\nthe prime minister also welcomed the initiative of poland and italy to form an alliance for the next european elections, to fight for the renaissance of european values ​​against the immigrationist schemes of the globalists.\n\nthe italian-polish alliance, the warsaw-rome alliance is one of the biggest events that could mark this beginning of the year, mr. orbán said, while holding up italian interior minister matteo salvini as a hero who managed to stop the influx of migrants in italy.\n\nmr. salvini met wednesday with his polish counterpart joachim brudzinski to discuss migration policies and european union (eu) border security.\n\nthe europe that will be formed in june will guide us all, unlike the one that exists today and is led by bureaucrats, salvini said during his visit to warsaw.\n\nthis is not the first time that mr. orbán has called out mr. macron as a key player in europe's pro-immigration forces.\n\nlast august, mr. orbán and mr. salvini labeled the globalist french president the leader of pro-migration parties in europe today at a joint press conference in milan, italy.\n\nthe two pro-sovereignty politicians singled out macron as their political enemy, announcing that they would form an anti-mass migration coalition ahead of european parliament elections to challenge his vision for the european union.\n\nhe leads the european force that backs migration, he's the leader of those parties who back migration to europe, and on the other side there's us who want to stop illegal migration, orbán said.\n\nfor his part, mr. macron welcomed the title, announcing that he is the chief adversary of the european populist bloc spearheaded by matteo salvini and viktor orbán.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
thursday on the hugh hewitt show, sen. ron johnson (r-wi) said it is likely if president donald trump declared a national emergency to build a border wall it would be overturned in the courts.\n\npartial transcript as follows:\n\njohnson: well, first of all, i think the president will. he's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. and from my standpoint, i think one of the things republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. you know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. we should be preparing, and i'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that i'm a co-sponsor of to fund the coast guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. hopefully, mitch mcconnell will bring it up on the floor of the senate. i don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. and of course, nancy pelosi was very clear in the white house yesterday that when president trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? you know, will i get my barrier funding? and she said no. and so again, the democrats are being hypocritical. they're paying lip service to border security. barriers actually work. they absolutely do. we need them. it's kind of a first step table stakes issue. but they're playing politics. and i hope the president stands strong.\n\nhewitt: should the president invoke a national emergency declaration even though there are good arguments on both sides whether or not that is constitutional?\n\njohnson: yeah, you know, i hope he doesn't. i think that does open up a pandora's box. i think we'd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. you know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don't fund it. and i think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.\n\nhewitt: but the consequences are spreading. i know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because fema can't issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. and so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. i'm not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an article i guy, you're not going to like the idea that article ii can act unilaterally.\n\njohnson: no, i don't think any of us should. and let's face it, i think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. i mean, they're going to take it up to the 9th circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won't get the barrier. so i want the barrier. i want a secure border. and i think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the president was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. you know, i'm all for doing that. i'm happy to hang with him. there will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. i mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. there's no doubt about it. so let's address that specifically. don't completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with plan b as democrats, as nancy pelosi, chuck schumer continue to dig in, let's give them basically an offer that they simply can't refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.\n\nhewitt: but that ends up, again, leaving if not 800,000 people out of a paycheck, 400,000 people without a paycheck and the consequences of a shutdown, whereas a national emergency declaration allows you to reopen the government and moves the question of the president's power concerning the border squarely, and jonathan turley has written a great piece on this in the hill. i know you're an article i guy. but i'm not sure, it goes to the 9th circuit, they'll lose in the 9th circuit. it would go up to the supreme court. are you sure it would lose at the supreme court, senator johnson?\n\njohnson: no, i have no idea. i'm not a lawyer. but let's face it. the administration hasn't been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. it's going to be based on their policy preference. so let's face it. our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.\n\nhewitt: now, but do you believe if it got to the supreme court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?\n\njohnson: i really don't know.\n\nhewitt: i don't think anyone does. that's the right answer. i don't think anyone does. so given that it's an open question, and i know jonathan turley thinks it's an open question, you'll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it's a closed question. it's not. nobody knows what they would do. the key case here is youngstown sheet and tube. given that that is an open question, isn't that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? or do you think yours is the preferred solution?\n\njohnson: well, again, i want to maintain pressure, because i actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. you know, hugh, we do have a crisis. you know, it drives me crazy how democrats are minimizing this problem. you know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? everybody recognized it. the obama administration responded to it. the cbp was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. about 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. in the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. you know, we have the flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. and once they get here, they are home free. and when i hear democrats talk about technology on the border, i mean, that's fine. we can track somebody, we can apprehend them. we process them. and then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. that's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally and hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, i think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted. i've seen the pictures of a dead, desiccated animal-chewed bodies in the desert because we incentivize people to try and come to this country illegally. there's nothing humane about that. that is the crisis.
california governor gavin newsom proposed his first budget for the state on friday, and it includes a tax on drinking water.\n\nthe budget, titled california for all, declares drinking water a fundamental right, and adds: the budget includes short-term measures to bring immediate relief to communities without safe drinking water and also proposes an ongoing sustainable funding source to address this problem into the future.\n\nthat source is a new fund, the safe and affordable drinking water fund:\n\nsafe and affordable drinking water fund—establish a new special fund, with a dedicated funding source from new water, fertilizer, and dairy fees, to enable the state water resources control board to assist communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, in paying for the short-term and long-term costs of obtaining access to safe and affordable drinking water. this proposal is consistent with the policy framework of sb 623, introduced in the 2017-18 legislative session. the budget also includes $4.9 million general fund on a one-time basis for the state water resources control board and the department of food and agriculture to take initial steps toward implementation of this new safe and affordable drinking water program, including (1) implementation of fee collection systems, (2) adoption of an annual implementation plan, and (3) development of a map of high-risk aquifers used as drinking water sources.\n\nthe san francisco chronicle notes: the details of the proposed tax are unknown, but a similar proposal was abandoned by then-governor jerry brown last year after failing to garner enough support in the legislature.\n\ncritics have already slammed the plan, with former republican gubernatorial candidate travis allen urging fellow republicans to take back the state, and the howard jarvis taxpayer association and the association of california water agencies saying the state should tap into its budget surplus to pay for the needed clear water supplies.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
senator lindsey graham led a group of republican senators warning that they would oppose a swift passage of the economic rescue package unless changes are made to its unemployment benefits section.\n\nthat prompted vermont senator bernie sanders to say he too would hold up the bill over his objections to the aid to u.s. businesses.\n\nunless republican senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, i am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund, senator sanders tweeted.\n\ngraham's last-minute objections to the deal agreed to by the white house, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and democrat leader chuck schumer sent shudders through financial markets. stocks lost about half their gains for the day as it became apparent that the deal was not as sure to pass as it had seemed.\n\ngraham said in a statement issued with senator tim scott, the south carolina republican, and senator ben sasse, the nebraska republican, that there was a massive drafting error in the economic stimulus bill.\n\nunless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work, the senators said. we must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the department of labor issues regulatory guidance that no american would earn more by not working than by working.\n\nin ordinary circumstances, unemployment benefits are designed to pay workers less than they would earn by working, creating an incentive to seek and accept work. the economic rescue package under consideration by senate provides for bolstered benefits that could, in some circumstances, pay some workers more than they had earned while employed.\n\nthis bill pays you more not to work than if you were working, graham said during a press conference wednesday. if this is not a drafting error, then this is the worst idea that i've seen in a long time.\n\nproponents of the more generous benefits say that in the current situation, where many businesses have been closed by anti-pandemic efforts and workers are being urged to stay home, this objection is meritless. when people are told not to work for the sake of public health, disincentivizing work is not a serious problem.\n\nsenator rick scott, the florida republican, joined the other three senators at a press conference on the issue wednesday.\n\nonce we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn't have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce,  the florida senator tweeted.\n\ngraham's comments suggest he did not understand that millions of american workers are being shut out of their workplaces by government policy, minimizing the cost created by alleged incentives not to work. what's more, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits.\n\nsanders' responded by raising his own objections to the bill. it's likely that if graham and his fellow republicans open up parts of the bill to renegotiation, democrats will also demand changes.\n\nunless republican senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, i am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund. pic.twitter.com/7x0o9c4boo — bernie sanders (@sensanders) march 25, 2020\n\nthat could result in delays to the rescue package that could make the economic damage from the pandemic much more severe.
the lack of taxpayer payments to central american economic migrants is a crisis on the border, says california democrat scott peters, who presented the party's weekend message.\n\nit's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations, he said in the carefully drafted january 11 speech.\n\npeters did not say how much financial aid and healthcare must be given by u.s. taxpayers to the economic migrants as they head for u.s. jobs, communities, and schools.\n\noverall, the speech tried to blame president donald trump for public alarm over the growing flood of economic migrants into u.s. job markets and neighborhoods. peters said:\n\nthere is a humanitarian crisis created by him. it's a crisis when the president threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick. it a crisis when the president spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in november, as a political stunt to rally the base. it's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.\n\nin reality, migrants bring their children because multiple democrat-backed loopholes in u.s asylum law allow them to walk through the border walls and into u.s jobs, welfare programs, schools, and communities.\n\nthe democrats' speech tried to reassure voters that democrats are not pushing for a policy of open borders, even though nearly all democratic legislators oppose any policies which might reduce the flow of migrants. nearly all democrats also oppose the deportation of economic migrants, even after judges say they do not meet u.s. legal requirements for asylum.\n\npeters said:\n\nwhen president trump says democrats are against border security and for open borders, he's lying. we do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. no. that's not border security. that's borderline crazy.\n\ninstead of a border wall – like the triple-layered wall which effectively protects his district from migration out of mexico — peters touted the democrats' promise of a virtual wall of technology and sensors. legislators know the virtual wall does not stop migrants — but it does shield some pro-migration politicians from worried voters.\n\npeters pushed that claim while touting a draft bill that would require the border agencies to postpone action until they have studied the migration problem they have studied and grappled with for decades:\n\nin the last congress, my colleagues pete aguilar of california, a democrat, and will hurd of texas, a republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. it would have directed homeland security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer congress a strategy for each section of the border. it might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in san diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. it might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. it might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. but if homeland security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.\n\nnancy pelosi is pushing the no-wall 'technology wall' alternative to trump's actual wall. the pr scam worked for biz under bush/obama – until the public picked trump to build a real wall. but it now might help provide pr cover for democrats to compromise. https://t.co/hqx024ecty — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) january 11, 2019\n\nnationwide, the u.s. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nthe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nimmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing

this year's oscar broadcast could be a lot less boring as the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced monday that acceptance speeches can no longer contain the endless lists of thank yous that have become a staple at the awards ceremony.\n\nat the annual oscar nominee luncheon in beverly hills on monday, the academy announced that for the first time, all nominees would submit written lists of those they wish to thank that will then be displayed on screens at the dolby theatre and on viewers' screens at home.\n\nas you probably are aware, and we don't want to embarrass anybody, but there is a long list of winners who have totally forgotten their directors, their husbands, their wives, their children and their animals, producer david hill said, according to the independent. it's a permanent record which could be kept, even framed and kept in the family forever. how cool is that?!\n\nacceptance speeches were capped at 45 seconds beginning in 2010. the new move allows the academy to skip past what is traditionally the most boring part of any oscars ceremony, and nominees will be under less pressure to remember every single producer or associate they ever worked with.\n\nwhile the new policy will help cut down on famously long speeches like those from dallas buyers club winner matthew mcconaughey and monster's ball's halle berry, it could also deprive viewers of some of the most memorable oscars moments ever, like cuba gooding, jr.'s acceptance speech at the 1997 oscars:\n\njoe pesci, however, is unlikely to be affected.
the times of israel reports: united nations — the united states absolutely supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict but is thinking of new ways to push for a peace deal, us ambassador nikki haley (pictured) said thursday.\n\nit would be an error to say the united states is abandoning its decades-old policy of backing a palestinian state as part of a final settlement, she told reporters.\n\nwe absolutely support a two-state solution, but we are thinking out-of-the-box as well, haley said following a security council meeting on the israeli-palestinian conflict.\n\nread more here.
lawmakers in north dakota are taking up legislation that would allow competing in sports in high school and college based on one's biological sex.\n\nif it becomes law it would mean that girls or boys could not participate in sports based on their preferred gender, they would have to compete based on their actual sex.\n\nthe grand forks herald reported on the bill:\n\nhouse bill 1298 would prevent publicly funded institutions, like high schools and universities, from allowing any individual who was assigned the opposite sex at birth to participate on an athletic team that is designed exclusively for females or exclusively for males. additionally, the bill would outlaw any state-owned athletic facility from hosting a competition in which an athlete competes against anyone outside of the gender they were assigned at birth. but while lgbtq advocates argued the bill would have far-reaching implications for transgender people in north dakota, its lead sponsor, rep. ben koppelman, r-west fargo, said the legislation has nothing to do with transgender athletes. instead, koppelman said he is pursuing changes to the law out of a concern for fairness in sports and to prevent women from being disadvantaged by having to compete against men. while transgender athletes are not explicitly noted in koppelman's bill, critics argued that it clearly targets the transgender community. house minority leader josh boschee, d-fargo, said he couldn't think of any other reason that this bill would be introduced.\n\ni kind of dismiss the idea that it should be about trans, because it's not about trans — it's about fair competition, koppelman said. what it's based on is science that says, 'here are the physiological differences between people when they are born.' and these are irreversible things.\n\ni don't know the problem that's trying to be solved, koppelman said.\n\nright now under a north dakota high school activities association 2015 statute transgender students taking hormonal supplements can compete in sports under their gender identity on a case by case basis.\n\nunder this policy, a student who has transitioned from female to male may compete in boys sports but is no longer eligible to compete in girls sports, the tribune reported. a student who has transitioned from male to female may continue to compete in boys sports and is eligible to compete in girls sports after completing one year of testosterone suppression.\n\nthe tribune interviewed opponents to the legislation, including libby skarin, a regional campaign director with the american civil liberties union (aclu), who said the bill is an attack on transgender north dakotans.\n\neither don't compete at all, or compete in a sport that doesn't match their gender identity, skarin said.\n\nsen. janne myrdal, r-edinburg, is a co-sponsor on the bill and said it was about women's rights and disagrees.\n\ni would never want my daughter to play in sports and have a guy beat her out in track or out in javelin, where she has no chance, myrdal said.\n\nunlike a transgender athlete bill defeated in the south dakota legislature in 2019, koppelman's bill also applies to collegiate athletics, a difference that skarin said could put north dakota out of step with national governing bodies like the national collegiate athletic association, the tribune reported.\n\nthe ncaa supports athletes competing according to their perceived gender rather than their biological sex.\n\nmydral said in the report that students have to make choices, including whether they want to pursue athletics.\n\npeople will scream and holler and say, 'oh, you denied them being in sports,' she said. yeah, maybe we do. so maybe by making that choice to try to change your gender, you lose some opportunities. but you're not going to take all women and girls' opportunities away just because you wish to do that.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
the united kingdom has shrugged off concerns of handing china a back-door key to the nation's critical national infrastructure and spiking post-brexit trade with key anglosphere allies, signing off the involvement of huawei in the future 5g data networks.\n\ntech giant huawei, a company critics claim is controlled by the chinese government and uses its advanced, cheap, and pervasive equipment to commit espionage on foreign powers — claims the company strongly denies — will have a so-called limited role in the rollout of next-generation 5g technology, the british government has decided.\n\ndelingpole: huawei, coronavirus and boris's great brexit betrayal https://t.co/xdfshrd9cj — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) january 27, 2020\n\nthe move was decided tuesday by the uk national security council, a group of senior cabinet ministers chaired by the prime minister and attended by civil servants and military bosses, following advice from the civil service, which decided in spite of the many warnings and potential pitfalls presented by the huawei deal to rubber-stamp the deal last week.\n\nunder the decision, huawei will not be permitted to supply equipment to sensitive parts of the network core, but will provide a third of the equipment to what the bbc reports to be the periphery of britain's future 5g network. the report states the permitted equipment will include masts, clearly implying the radio backbone of the network itself which will handle consumer and business data will use huawei technology.\n\nthe distinction between the core and the periphery has been enough for the government to overlook security warnings from both senior intelligence figures as home, and key allies abroad. but the united states, for instance, which has been absolutely clear in its calls for huawei to be totally excluded, believes the distinction now will not protect the network from potential espionage and sabotage in future.\n\nwhat is less clear, is why the british government has so willingly entered into a relationship with huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the european union. australia and new zealand have warned the uk against imperilling the five-eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the united states has explicitly said huawei involvement would imperil a post-brexit trade deal.\n\nu.s. warns britain accepting huawei 5g will imperil post-brexit trade deal https://t.co/rik3ojyxhk — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) january 25, 2020\n\nthis is of particular importance because signing a trade deal with the united states quickly after brexit appears to be a key lynchpin of the post-eu strategy, as an easy passage of that agreement would be a major signal to the rest of the world that the uk is emerging ready to trade, and easy to do business with. it also holds the european union's feet to the fire, as their anticipated prevarication over signing a deal with the uk would be shown up as a sham in the light of a quick deal with the u.s.\n\nyet, the bbc reports, china seems to have given the united kingdom a simple choice — choose huawei or face substantial repercussions to trade and investment. given the choice between the u.s. and china, prime minister johnson appears to have chosen beijing.\n\ngiven this disconnect in stated policy and public action, some may view the advice of unelected civil servants to the national security council to ignore security and trade concerns and sign with huawei anyway with concern.\n\nresponding tuesday, a white house spokesman said the trump administration was disappointed with the decision, while conservative statesman and former party leader sir iain duncan smith has said the decision beggars belief.\n\nklon kitchen of the heritage foundation said of china's previous bad-faith behaviour on leveraging their tech equipment installed in foreign nations: china has already shown it's perfectly willing and able to exploit others in this way, having siphoned data from the african union headquarters in ethiopia, over networks its state-owned companies constructed earlier this decade. recent history and common sense are united: it would be utterly foolish for britain to give china similar access.\n\njames delingpole writes of this in breitbart london:\n\nthe huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything boris johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. it's also a betrayal of the very thing on which boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful brexit. one of the key elements in boris's vision of a bright, post-brexit future for britain outside the european union is international trade: all those incredible deals britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by eu regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by president trump with the u.s. but trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the huawei deal. if you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the remain-biased civil service — led by arch-remainer mark sedwill — is using the huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage boris's post-brexit deals in order to make the brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the eu more likely. you would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. we have scotched the remainer snake but we have not killed it. no doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.\n\nread more
brazil's new president, jair bolsonaro, was sworn in on january 1. he won a landslide election in october on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-united states, and pro-israel. at the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-cuba, and anti-venezuela.\n\nin his inaugural address, bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. for instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words ordem e progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: the national motto is order and progress. no society can develop without respecting these:\n\na recent poll showed his approval rating to be 75 percent.\n\nyet at the same time, bolsonaro has plenty of enemies, especially in the international media. although he embraces the label tropical trump, the media escalate from there; it's common to see him characterized as a neo-fascist, or just a plain old fascist.\n\nyet brazilians will likely judge bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. the country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.\n\nby territory, brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. it's been estimated, in fact, that brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. that's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every brazilian man, woman, and child.\n\nit is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.\n\nyet if fairly dividing the pie is important, strongly expanding the pie is even more important. there's wealth in brazil, but not nearly enough of it—at least not now.\n\nand part of that problem is that brazil is remarkably undeveloped. if we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the atlantic ocean. we might compare this situation to that of the u.s.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across north america, to texas, california—and everywhere else west of the atlantic seaboard.\n\nso why haven't brazilians gone west, as we did? part of the answer is that the territory is mostly amazonian rain forest, and as such, for most of brazil's history, it has been inhospitable to settlement, let alone development.\n\nyet by the time that new technologies to foster development in amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.\n\nthe new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.\n\nas a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.\n\ncombined with other environmental restrictions on land use, amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. and, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.\n\nindeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. and brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.\n\nwe can say that brazil today is a bit like what the u.s. would be like if the land west of the appalachian mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (in fact, the u.s. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)\n\nmoreover, as we all know, in recent years there's been a sudden surge of attempted restrictions on economic activity in every country in the world—namely, international mandates to clamp down on carbon dioxide, all aimed at doing something about climate change.\n\nthe average brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible. indeed, brazil is rated as having the highest crime rate in the world, and street crime is terrifyingly rampant.\n\nyet still, before bolsonaro, leftist brazilian governments had meekly accepted the western green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.\n\nthen came bolsonaro. his campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 paris climate framework, and he has named ernesto araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in october, the tactic of the left essentially consists of the following: to sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:\n\nso we can see that in his fierce antagonism toward foreign hegemonists, araújo almost sounds like a leftist himself. and yet he's not: he's simply a brazilian nationalist, tired of other countries imposing their will on his country.\n\nin december, bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: environmental politics can't muddle with brazil's development. today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.\n\nyet in addition, brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.\n\nas bloomberg news has reported, bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. one of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual gdp totals barely more than $2 trillion. the metal is already being mined in brazil, but bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.\n\nas an aside, we might note that rare-earth elements are a key strategic concern of the u.s., since they are vital to our military technology, as well as to our civilian tech. and yet today, the u.s. is 100 percent dependent on china for 29 minerals.\n\nif such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. the trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. and so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from brazil.\n\nneedless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.\n\ngiven this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that western greens would be well advised to work with brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. that is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. after all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.\n\nyet instead, it seems as though western greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with bolsonaro. on december 27, the sierra club magazine headlined a story, what will it take to rein in the trump of brazil? brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. in that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that ernesto araújo was railing against—the sierra club declares, bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.\n\nwe might pause over that word: contain. that is, the people of brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. and yet now, the sierra club, and other western greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the brazilian standard of living.\n\nwill brazilian nationalists be pleased to discover that the greens are actively using international financial levers against their country? and how will ordinary brazilians respond to these threats to their standard of living? it will be interesting to see what happens in this looming standoff.\n\nlike donald trump in north america, jair bolsonaro in south america is an experiment. both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:\n\ntrump has his track record, and bolsonaro is starting his. mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention.
well-heeled customers of the new york times paid more than $7000, not including airfare, to tour the country of iran and even visit the home of the late ayatollah khomeini. this at a time when a washington post reporter had been in a brutal tehran prison for more than two years.\n\nthe official tour guides of these trips included by-lined reporters and columnists of the times, raising ethical questions and questions about the times' often favorable coverage of the repressive regime. lee smith of the tablet goes so far as to accuse the times of buying the iran concession.\n\nthe trips are a part of the new york times' glitzy times journeys that typically sends wealthy readers to places like austria and great britain.\n\njames kirchik, writing in foreign policy, said it is dismaying that the times would collaborate in a business venture with a government currently imprisoning an american reporter.\n\ncalled iran: tales from persia, the 13-day tour included on the ground experts who will help untangle this nation's complex timeline. starting in tehran, you will journey across the country, through beautiful landscapes, arid mountains and rural villages, learning about the traditions and cultures of a land who influence has been felt for thousands of years.\n\nthe business aspect of the arrangement would almost certainly have to be approved by the iranian government, with the regime taking a cut of the new york times action.\n\nsmith accuses the times of going into this business arrangement to spare their own people the fate of jason rezaian [washington post reporters who was just released] while also ensuring that they would have plenty of access to the regime — or the people who speak to western reporters, namely the moderates. he calls the arrangement a bribe.\n\nsmith calls this a new journalism model where the times makes money not on getting new readers, but on selling travel to authoritarian regimes and gaining journalistic access in the bargain.\n\nwould the regime have struck a deal with the times if the paper of record promised to send its toughest, hardest-hitting reporting — the kinds of tough guys like burns or c.j. chivers who would rather have their fingernails pulled out one by one by the torturers in evin prison than pull their punches in print? he asks.\n\nrather, the times uses name reporters like roger cohen, elaine sciolino, and john f. burns, who moonlight as tour guides. smith excoriates the times' man in tehran thomas erdbrink, who has consistently lauded current iranian president hassan rouhani. smith says, selective ignorance seems to be erdbrink's journalistic trademark.\n\nsmith accuses erdbrink of going out of his way defend the iranian president, such as the time erdbrink reported that rouhani went on cnn and condemned the holocaust though it was pointed out rouhani never used that word. erdbrink also reported that rouhani wished israelis a happy rosh hashanah though the times later had to correct that.\n\nit is unclear whether jews or homosexuals are allowed on the new york times tours to iran.\n\nfollow austin ruse on twitter @austinruse.
democrat presidential candidates entered the ninth democrat presidential primary debate on wednesday in attack mode.\n\nthe candidates launched at least 50 different attacks in the debate that, at times, appeared to overwhelm the nbc debate moderators.\n\nthe candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on wednesday.\n\nmr. bloomberg had policies in new york city of stop and frisk, which went after african american and latino people in an outrageous way, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) said in his first debate answer. that is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) went further, reminding voters that bloomberg called women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, comparing him to president donald trump.\n\nlook, i'll support whoever the democratic nominee is, she said. but understand this: democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar (d-mn) attacked bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.\n\ni'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from mayor bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.\n\njoe biden began the debate by challenging bloomberg on new york city's policy of stop-and-frisk.\n\nhe didn't get a whole lot done, biden said about bloomberg. he had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\npete buttigieg began his remarks by warning democrats that the democrat race could end up between bloomberg and sanders.\n\nlet's put forward somebody who's actually a democrat, he said, alluding to sanders' political identity as a democratic socialist and bloomberg's flip from a republican to an independent to a democrat.\n\nwe shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. we can do better.\n\nsanders then pivoted to buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like michael bloomberg, prompting buttigieg to accuse sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the culinary union in las vegas.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar jumped in to attack sanders' insurance bill, citing the millions of americans who could lose their health care under his plan.\n\nwarren then attacked buttigieg, klobuchar, and sanders on their health care plans.\n\nbuttigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. klobuchar, she said, was like a post-it note, that read, insert plan here. and sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.\n\nklobuchar pivoted to a las vegas gambling attack on both warren's and sanders' plan for health care.\n\nwhy is medicare for all not on the wheel? she asked. why is it not on the wheel? because two-thirds of the democratic senators are not even on that bill.\n\nbiden then stepped in to warn that sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked bloomberg for calling obamacare a disgrace.\n\nwhat am i, chicken liver? bloomberg responded when warren jumped in to attack buttigieg's plan.\n\nas the moderators turned the debate topic to bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in new york, biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.\n\nlet's get the order straight. and it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. it's the policy. the policy was abhorrent. and it was a fact of violation of every right people have.\n\nwarren attacked bloomberg by accusing him of willful ignorance of the stop-and-frisk impact on communities of color.\n\nwhen the moderators questioned whether sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.\n\nbut buttigieg responded by attacking sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.\n\nklobuchar attacked sanders for failing to release the records from his physical and called for bloomberg to release his tax returns.\n\nafter bloomberg said he was working on it, warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nsanders attacked bloomberg by reminding democrats that he supported former president george w. bush for president in 2004 and donated to republicans.\n\nbiden reminded voters that bloomberg did not support obama for president.\n\nafter the moderators switched topics, buttigieg then jumped to attack klobuchar for failing to remember the name of the mexican president.\n\nare you trying to say that i'm dumb? klobuchar replied. or are you mocking me here, pete?\n\nas klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the senator of minnesota, buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate walter mondale, also from minnesota.\n\nthe nbc debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.\n\nsanders hit bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.\n\nbloomberg hit sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.\n\ni was thinking there was going to be a boxing rematch on saturday in vegas, and those guys should go down there, klobuchar replied, referring to an upcoming boxing fight in the state.\n\nsanders continued, attacking bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted bloomberg to call sanders a communist.\n\nwe're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. we tried. other countries tried that. it was called communism, and it just didn't work.\n\nsanders continued to attack bloomberg for his wealth until the former new york city mayor reminded him that the vermont senator owns three houses.\n\nwhat a wonderful country we have. the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.\n\nbuttigieg then flattered sanders by saying he was into bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.\n\nwhen warren got time, she attacked biden and klobuchar for being eager to be liked by mitch mcconnell and buttigieg for taking money from big donors and changing his positions.\n\nbuttigieg used his time to attack bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while sanders was trying to burn the house down.\n\nhe also criticized klobuchar for voting to confirm trump's nominee for customs and border protection.\n\nas klobuchar and buttigieg bickered back and forth, debate moderator chuck todd intervened.\n\nguys, guys, we are at the end here. we are at the end here, he said. i've got to let that one go.

norristown, pa. (ap) — former attorney general kathleen kane was sentenced monday to 10 to 23 months in jail for illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation to embarrass a rival and lying about it under oath.\n\nkane was also sentenced to eight years of probation by a montgomery county judge who said kane's ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law.\n\njudge wendy demchick-alloy said kane assumed an off with your heads mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. the judge called kane a political neophyte who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.\n\nthis case is about ego – the ego of a politician consumed with her image from day one, demchick-alloy said. this case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant … felt had embarrassed her in the press.\n\nkane, the first woman and first democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. she will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.\n\nafter she posts bond, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.\n\nshe had been a stay-at-home mother, and former assistant county prosecutor, before using her husband's trucking fortune to run for statewide office in 2012. she quickly became a rising star in the state democratic party before her office devolved into turmoil as career prosecutors came and went.\n\nkane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.\n\nyour children are the ultimate … collateral damages. they are casualties of your actions, the judge said. but you did that, not this court. \n\nearlier monday, kane's 15-year-old son, chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by nixonian espionage.\n\nkane, 50, had argued that the loss of her career, law license and reputation was punishment enough. she had asked the judge to sentence her to probation or house arrest so she could be home to raise her sons.\n\ni really don't care what happens to me, kane said during before leaning toward the defense table to grab tissues. there is no more torture in the world than to watch your children suffer and know you had something to do with it.\n\nthe one-term attorney general said her younger son, 14-year-old zachary, did not attend monday's sentencing because he couldn't even bear it.\n\nkane's family declined to comment after the sentencing.\n\nprosecutors called her crimes egregious and pushed for jail time. they said a paranoid kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.\n\nkane didn't testify at her trial. she was convicted in august of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.\n\non monday, former deputy clarke madden said in court that a dark cloud permeated every corner of the attorney general's office and victims, witnesses and other law enforcement agencies feared working with them.\n\nthrough a pattern of systemic firings and nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office, said erik olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.\n\nkane enjoyed mostly good press early on as she supported gay marriage, ramped up a child predator unit run by her twin sister and questioned her predecessor's handling of the penn state sex assault case.\n\nbut turmoil inside the office became apparent as top deputies and career prosecutors headed for the doors. kane's feud with one of them, frank fina, who had helped run the penn state probe and other sensitive investigations, led to the leak.\n\nkane, taking aim at him, had a campaign consultant pass confidential files to a reporter about a corruption case fina had declined to charge before he left the office. she then tried to frame someone else for the leak, aides testified at the perjury and obstruction trial.\n\naside from the conviction, kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. two state supreme court justices resigned amid the fallout.

a group supportive of russian president vladimir putin have announced their intention to hold a gays for putin rally ahead of march's presidential election, despite the country's stringent laws on homosexuality.\n\nthe moscow times reports that the group, which calls itself gays for putin!' has asked authorities in st. petersburg for permission to hold a rally with around 600 supporters.\n\nwe decided to express the impetus of the gay community by openly supporting vladimir putin as a presidential candidate, the group, led by organizers vyacheslav vereshchagin and alexei nazarov, said in a statement on tuesday.\n\nthey continued:\n\npeople often say that activists are cut off from the people. in russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-putin] demonstrations. therefore, homosexuals support president putin's towards lgbt people. putin signs laws that serve the strengthen the moral and spiritual foundations of russian society. notable homosexuals are awarded with orders and medals. many gay people in our country say, putin is our president. gays are for putin!\n\nafter submitting their request to local authorities, the group reportedly congregated at a local church service to pray for the success of the good endeavor.\n\nplans for the rally come days after a homophobic campaign video supporting putin appeared on social media, warning that his opponents will take the country into a nightmare future where people are forced to cohabitate with gays and lesbians.\n\nthe video, which has already attracted over three million views on facebook alone, shows the thoughts of a middle-aged man imagining a russia without putin, where a man can be seen in his kitchen and suggestively eating a banana and filing his nails.\n\nthe advert is intended as a contrast to putin's opponent ksenia sobchak, who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage and seeks to move the country in a less socially conservative direction.\n\npresenting lgbt people as a threat in a homophobic country is no joke, she wrote in an instagram post, while also condemning the video as vile.\n\nsobchak has faced widespread claims that she is actually part of a controlled opposition designed to give the impression that the election will be free and fair.\n\nother opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner alexei navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.\n\nsince returning to the presidency in 2012, putin has backed laws restricting the rights of lgbt people, which include a ban on loosely-defined homosexual propaganda in a bid to uphold russia's traditional conservative values.\n\nfollow ben kew on facebook, on twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
the loose confederation of churches affiliated with the worldwide anglican communion is experiencing growing tensions over the issue of homosexuality, with the u.s. episcopalian church tugging toward the liberal embrace of all things lgbt and the african churches struggling to maintain a more biblically based sexual morality.\n\nthe anglican church of nigeria has announced it will boycott the next international meeting of church leaders over the matter, and is now requesting special status in the worldwide church to allow it to faithfully preserve its position on homosexuality.\n\nin a forceful statement, the nigerian anglican primate, archbishop nicholas okoh, said that the anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.\n\ntraditional anglicans like the nigerian church, he said, are walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the scriptural provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\n\narchbishop okoh said his province will shun next month's anglican consultative council meeting in lusaka, zambia over the way the worldwide church has handled the wayward episcopal church in america, which he described as a toxic relationship.\n\nat a meeting of anglican primates in january of this year, it was decided that for a period of three years the episcopal church (tec) should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or policy. the measure was intended as a sanction over tec's approval of gay marriage and consecration of openly gay bishops.\n\nthose sanctions proved to be hollow, okoh said, and disapproval shifted toward those still embracing traditional beliefs regarding sexuality. okoh said that during the canterbury meeting, those who hold the orthodox view of human sexuality and marriage were denounced as 'homophobic,' underscoring that we were in the wrong place, he said.\n\nokoh's impression was that the anglican authorities thought they were exercising patience in order to gradually persuade the scripture-believers to embrace homosexual doctrine, something he says they will never do.\n\nin his statement, okoh reminds readers that nigeria was one of the provinces that protested against the consecration of the gay american bishop gene robinson, that boycotted the 2008 lambeth conference and helped set up the conservative global anglican future conference in jerusalem that same year.\n\nas a result, okoh has requested special status for the provinces who will never embrace the sexual culture being promoted by some provinces of the church over and against the bible.\n\nhe compared the idea of special status to the relationship between the united kingdom and the european union, where total union is impossible, but some degree of cooperation is deemed useful.\n\nthe anglican church claims some 85 million members worldwide and is divided into 38 provinces. only eight of these are favorable to changing doctrine on marriage to allow for same-sex unions, namely, the u.s., canada, scotland, wales, new zealand, south india, south africa and brazil.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
she goes by the name sa'a because — even three years after jumping from a moving truck to escape the boko haram terrorists that had kidnapped her and 275 other mostly christian schoolgirls in chibok, nigeria — she fears for her safety and that of the rest of her family.\n\nmy message to everyone is that it's been three years now, sa'a told breitbart news three years to the day of her abduction.\n\nnot three days, or three months, but three years, sa'a, who now lives in the united states, said at an event at the newseum's religious freedom center in washington d.c. to mark the anniversary of the event. every individual that has power to do something that would bring those girls back should just do something.\n\nsince that fateful day, 57 girls, including sa'a, escaped from the radical islamic terrorists. last october, the nigerian government worked out a deal with boko haram to return 21 more of the girls, many of whom has been raped, some returning with children in tow.\n\nthat leaves 195 girls who are still missing.\n\nit is fitting that this happened on good friday, said emmanuel ogebe, a nigerian human rights attorney based in washington d.c. who has sponsored 15 young women survivors from nigeria, including sa'a, to come and study in the united states.\n\nwhen jesus died the sun hid its face in shame because of what happened, ogebe said. now the world should hide its face in shame because it has forgotten the 195 girls that are still missing.\n\nogebe, who has traveled to nigeria on many occasions to help survivors and to lobby the nigerian government to do more to secure the release of the remaining victims, said he knows that some of the girls have died. one girl, he said, was stoned to death when she refused to convert to islam.\n\nthis is way beyond just hashtags, ogebe said of the social media #bringbackourgirls movement that happened after one of the largest mass abductions in modern history.\n\nthere are practical things that can be done, ogebe said, adding that keeping the story in the public consciousness is one of those things.\n\nand, ogebe said, boko haram continues to abduct nigerian girls and uses them for the unspeakable practice of suicide bombing.\n\nthis week, the united nations children's fund (unicef) confirmed that fact.\n\nunicef emphasized wednesday that beyond the high-profile chibok abductions, the practice of kidnapping children and forcing them to associate with the armed group has been prevalent, the associated press reported.\n\nyoung girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds, unicef reported. in some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process.\n\nthis is typically followed by an extended journey to a boko haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery, unicef reported.\n\nogebe said that the nigerian government is not transparent about its dealings with boko haram or about the girls who were released in october. all remain in the custody of the government and have not been reunited with their families.\n\nwe don't think the nigerian government is doing anything much about rescuing the girls, seshugh akume of the bring back our girls organization, told usa today on thursday. we are disappointed.\n\nthe general attitude is they wish everybody to keep quiet about it and move on because they get angry whenever the missing chibok girls are mentioned, akume said.\n\nbut nigerian president muhammadu buhari marked the anniversary by calling it one of the worst crimes committed against his country.\n\ni wish to reassure the parents of the chibok girls, all well-meaning nigerians, organizations and the international community, that as a government, we are unrelenting on the issue of the safe return of our children, said buhari, who campaigned for office by promising to recover the victims.\n\nif i stop telling my story people will forget my classmates, sa'a said.

the once wholesome miley cyrus has partnered with feminist artist marilyn minter to raise funds for planned parenthood, the abortion business announced thursday in new york.\n\nminter photographed cyrus, now 23, as if she was behind a steamy shower door. only 50 of the limited edition prints are being sold at artsy for $5,500 each, with 100 percent of the proceeds supporting planned parenthood. for those with a smaller piggy bank, marc jacobs will sell t-shirts featuring other more sexually provocative images from minter's session with cyrus, including miley hearts planned parenthood, and pro choice miley. the cost of the t-shirts is $60 each and will be available at marc jacobs shops on may 16.\n\nsoon 2 be unveiled pic.twitter.com/pvr70ljpnq — miley ray cyrus (@mileycyrus) april 13, 2016\n\nas artsy reports, minter – now in her 60s – has been known for her depictions of women in the throes of sexual pleasure or adorned with dirt and diamonds since the 1970s. a supporter of both the lgbt agenda and abortion rights, she joined forces with planned parenthood last year for its most lucrative benefit auction, which raised $2.3 million for the abortion business from the sale of works by various artists.\n\nas artnet reports, minter earned planned parenthood's woman of valor award.\n\nthis is a really vital time, i think, the artist said during her acceptance speech. i want planned parenthood to start coming out of the closet, and i want to take our cues and inspiration from the marriage-equality movement.\n\nminter, who designed planned parenthood pins that say, don't f**k with me, don't f**k without us, says she chose to photograph cyrus because she's an activist and she has 40.5 million instagram followers.\n\nshe's been famous since she was 11 and she's a great artist, so she doesn't care about making money—she wants to give back, she continued. she founded the happy hippie foundation, which supports lgbtq youth. she flies commercial because she's conscious of her carbon footprint. now she's going to help us with planned parenthood.\n\nasked by artsy about why she chose planned parenthood as her charity, minter replied:\n\nthat was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. we hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since bill clinton was elected—we thought that war was over. laurie, cindy, and i—and so many others—worked so hard for abortion rights in the '70s and '80s, and all of a sudden that work started to unravel. planned parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.\n\nin addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, planned parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.\n\nthough planned parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in october announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. the organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by the center for medical progress (cmp), were deceptively edited.\n\nhowever, a democrat opposition research firm named fusion – hired by planned parenthood itself to review the videos — said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, the analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\n\nadditionally, fusion noted, [a]nalysts found no evidence that cmp inserted dialogue not spoken by planned parenthood staff.\n\nan analysis by coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by alliance defending freedom, found that the videos were not manipulated and that they are authentic.\n\nthe great @mintermarilyn being honored by planned parenthood for her important advocacy for the… https://t.co/jp652iyvh5 — nancy spector (@nespector) april 15, 2016\n\nlooking back on the feminist influences in her life, minter said she has been an activist since high school, when she was always getting kicked out of class and in the dean's office.\n\nthen it was civil rights, and later it was the vietnam war, she recalled. i was there when they shut down the pentagon; i've been going on protest marches my whole life … and now, this fight against controlling and policing women's bodies feels like a war.\n\nminter, who said she was on cloud nine when obama was elected president, explained she was incensed when she heard on the radio that some planned parenthood clinics were closing down due to their failure to meet the new safety laws some states have passed.\n\nbut soon after, people—and public figures—started getting behind planned parenthood publicly, she said. lena dunham was one of the first, and all the women who contributed to her psa, and then miley [cyrus], and now marc [jacobs]. maybe he'll convince other companies to support, too.\n\nmost young women – and the general population of the united states – are no longer as supportive of abortion as were the old guard feminists in the 60s and 70s.\n\na recent marist college institute for public opinion poll found a full 81 percent of americans favor some restrictions on abortion — including limiting the procedure after the first three months — and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.\n\nin the survey of 1,700 americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.\n\nminter said she will likely do a fundraiser for hillary clinton's presidential campaign. clinton has already been endorsed in the primary by planned parenthood and much of the abortion industry.
the new york times editorial board says the trump administration is quietly advancing an anti-science agenda by supporting teen pregnancy prevention programs that encourage young people to refrain from sex to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (std).\n\nin an editorial sunday, the board condemns the promotion of abstinence among teens by the current department of health and human services (hhs). the reproach is delivered without one word about the scientific fact that the only certain way young teens can avoid having to deal with the unfortunate situations of an unplanned pregnancy or being infected with an std is to not have sex.\n\nthe administration is promoting a 'just say no' approach and is 'poised to shift title x family planning dollars … toward programs that advocate abstinence outside of marriage, says the editorial board, sure that only horrific outcomes will ensue from encouraging young people to delay sex until they are older, have completed school, and have met someone special.\n\nthe administration's approach defies all common sense, the editors write, claiming there is no evidence that teaching young people to make healthy decisions about sex will reduce teen pregnancies or stds.\n\nthe times continues that comprehensive sex education (cse) programs of the sort promoted by the obama administration are the reason why teen pregnancy has declined in the united states in recent years.\n\na senior hhs official, however, recently told breitbart news that this narrative is not supported by research data from the federal government itself.\n\na 2016 report from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) shows nearly 60 percent of high school students today have never had sex, an increase of 28 percent since 1991. this data complements research that also shows a historic drop in teen pregnancy rates since 1991.\n\nyet, despite this scientific data that was produced during his own tenure, in his proposed budget for fiscal year 2017, former president barack obama eliminated funding in his administration's teen pregnancy prevention program (tpp) for sex education programs that focus on reinforcing the healthy decision to delay sex made by many adolescents. his administration proposed only funding cse programs, which assume all middle school children need to know where to get the morning-after pill and how to use a condom.\n\nthe previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the hhs official said. and our commitment requires that we change that approach.\n\nan hhs document points to 37 evaluations of tpp programs performed for grant applications to fund the programs.\n\noverall, of the 37 funded and evaluated projects, 73% either had no impact or had a negative impact on teen behavior, with some teens more likely to begin having sex, to engage in unprotected sex, or to become pregnant, hhs explained. very few positive results were sustained over time.\n\nadditionally, as cdc has also observed, while teen sex and pregnancy rates are at record lows, sexually transmitted diseases (stds) are at record highs. hhs said sex education, therefore, should be centered on science in the promotion of optimal health outcomes.\n\nif we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? hhs asked. similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. there's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.\n\nthe times editors, however, are more concerned about keeping up appearances at places like the u.n., where, they gasp, trump administration officials have been heard referring to the united states as a pro-life nation.\n\nthe editorial board further condemns what it calls trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' the editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.\n\nmany parents throughout the united states say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like planned parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have lgbt-inclusive sex:\n\nwe are disgusted that our taxpayer money is going to teach children how to question their gender, perform anal and oral sex, and masturbate, said elizabeth johnston, the activist mommy, who led an international sex ed sit out in april.\n\nplanned parenthood's ideas about sex education have been exposed on other occasions.\n\npro-life organization live action produced a video in 2014 that highlighted the abortion vendor's normalization of bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism (bdsm) for young people.\n\nmore recently, planned parenthood itself released a video titled how to tell someone you have an std, in which the group minimizes the significance of sexually transmitted disease.\n\nso, you've got an std, the video's narrator nods casually. guess what? so do lots of other people. half of all people will get an std at some point in their life. seriously. not kidding – half. it's ok.\n\nfor the new york times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.\n\nsuch education keeps all people who are subjected to it in the dark about critical aspects of their health, and treats a normal part of life — sexuality, and women's sexuality in particular — as aberrant and shameful, they say.\n\nscience, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. and encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful.
seattle seahawks quarterback russell wilson is outspoken about his christian beliefs, but now some critics are attacking him for racy photos posted to social media by his pop singer wife, ciara.\n\non wednesday, ciara posted a series of photos to her instagram account depicting her in some rather intimate situations and scantily clad in some shots.\n\nthe 32-year-old singer was seen wearing nothing but a white button-down shirt arranged to show off parts of her highly toned body, according to christian post.\n\nalso, the photos were apparently taken by her nfl player husband.\n\nthe photos elicited a variety of reactions some praising them, others reportedly lusting after the nfl player's wife. but soon the pair came under fire for seeming to violate their christian beliefs by posting such intimate images.\n\none reply, for instance, jabbed the two saying, these pictures should be seen only by your husband, not on public display. are you not a christian family?\n\nanother post criticized ciara for perpetuating sex stereotypes.\n\n@ciara, i adore you and @dangerusswilson, and you have nothing to prove; y'all are the bomb. however, posting semi-naked pics only perpetuates the myth that women are merely sexual objects for all to see, the commenter wrote.\n\nthe nfl player was famous for advocating abstinence before marriage. before they wed, for instance, wilson told the audience at a san diego church event that he and ciara were doing it the jesus way and refusing to engage in sexual relations until they took their vows.\n\nwilson did admit that refraining from sex wasn't an easy decision, especially with such a beautiful woman as ciara. i ain't gonna lie to y'all now, i need y'all to pray for us. i know y'all seen her on the screen, he said.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston.
thursday on msnbc's all in, sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) said president donald trump's supreme court nominee to replace supreme court justice anthony kennedy would be someone who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women.\n\nwarren said, let's talk about what we know for sure is at stake and some of the questions that the nominee is going to face. donald trump has already said that he's going to pick somebody who has been prescreened off a list that that was put together by a group whose number one job—an extremist group—is to make sure that roe versus wade gets overturned.\n\nshe added, this means that he's looking for a nominee who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women. that's what's at stake in this one. and then from there, so much more. this is about health care cases that are percolating up through the courts, including the one we know about right now about pre-existing conditions. this is about the swing vote in our environmental protections, whether or not giant corporations are going to have the right to poison the water and foul the air. this is about workers' rights and whether or not the supreme court is going to stay on the path of trying to bust unions. this is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. this is one of those moments where justice kennedy has been the swing vote. look, i'll be blunt, he swung a lot of times in a direction i don't like, but he's been a swing vote. he was the one who helped stand up for equal marriage. all of that is now at risk—whether he, donald trump, gets to replace the swing vote with somebody off a pre-approved extremist list.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen
presidential candidate and billionaire mike bloomberg released his vision for putting in place a comprehensive policy to ensure lgbtq+ equality on tuesday.\n\nthe vision includes transgenders' rights to free sex surgery and hormone treatment, rights to shelter based on gender identity, and forcing law enforcement and health care providers to undergo cultural competency and implicit bias training.\n\nbloomberg said in a statement on his campaign website:\n\ni have been honored to stand with the lgbtq+ community in the fight for equality and justice, from new york, where we won marriage equality in 2011, to states across the country. that fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. as president, i will work to protect every member of the lgbtq+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. we will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. we cannot settle for anything less – and i won't.\n\nbloomberg's radical transgender agenda included supporting the do no harm act that would gut the religious freedom restoration act's provision to protect americans right to live and act according to their religious convictions.\n\nmike will … end the trump administration's practice of granting federally funded organizations a license to discriminate against people based on their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity, the website stated.\n\nbloomberg also supports passage of the equality act, which would bar governments and sports organizations from recognizing the biological/physiological difference between men and women and replace it with gender identity.\n\nthe website stated:\n\nmike will also protect and expand aca enrollment efforts and restrict the sale of plans that don't meet aca standards, ensuring coverage for medically-necessary gender-affirming care (e.g., gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy).\n\nbloomberg vowed to restore and enforce the department of housing and urban development (hud) equal access rule to ensure that transgender people are able to stay in shelters that match their gender identity.\n\nthis housing agenda would allow transgender women to stay in homeless and domestic violence shelters based on gender identity.\n\nbloomberg also would prioritize transgender rights in federal law enforcement:\n\nas president, mike will establish a comprehensive approach to addressing violence against lgbtq+ people, especially transgender women of color. mike will make hate and bias crimes a top federal priority, directing the fbi to take the lead on bias crime investigations, training local authorities to identify hate and pressing states to report all hate crimes to the federal government, and improving data collection on violent deaths of lgbtq+ people.\n\nas breitbart news reported, bloomberg and the left are embracing the transgender ideology despite scientific facts:\n\nattorney and writer jane robbins observed at the witherspoon institute's public discourse:\n\nthe concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. an individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. and as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. but the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. the cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.\n\nbloomberg also said he would restore u.s. leadership on lgbtq+ rights at home and around the world, even if the trump administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter
rep. ilhan omar (d-mn) has introduced a series of sweeping foreign policy bills, including one that would let congress limit the president's power to place international sanctions and declare national emergencies.\n\nomar describes the legislative package, titled pathway to peace (progressive, equitable, and constructive engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of america's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. i believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.\n\nendless war is not making our country safer. it is costing lives, destroying futures, and damaging our reputation in the world. today, i'm introducing the #pathwaytopeace, a new vision for american foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy. https://t.co/tpg8oqk1x7 — ilhan omar (@ilhanmn) february 12, 2020\n\nshe spoke about the bills at a panel discussion on capitol hill wednesday, framing them as a globalized approach to u.s. foreign policy.\n\nthese sets of bills are not about a single country or singling out one particular country, said omar, who serves on the house foreign affairs committee. it's about setting a common set of standards for the world.\n\none of the bills, the congressional oversight of sanctions act, would give congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the international emergency economic powers act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.\n\nwe need to restore congressional oversight, omar said. she explained that the bill requires an explanation for what foreign policy goal is supposed to be achieved with the given sanction and what the process for delisting an individual, entity or country should be.\n\nomar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. in the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as iran and venezuela. last april, she accused president trump of declaring a fake emergency at the u.s.-mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.\n\nthis is a fake emergency! donald trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. https://t.co/hvovzlydhw — ilhan omar (@ilhanmn) april 3, 2019\n\none of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of israel. the stop arming human rights abusers act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the commerce dept. (tear gas, etc.). while israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the israeli-palestinian conflict. last year, when she was denied entry to the jewish nation, she suggested that the u.s. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to israel to ensure full rights for palestinians.\n\nanother bill redirects defense spending – something omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the state department.\n\n[the] global peace building act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the pentagon's overseas contingency operation budget to the state department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.\n\nher press release does not specify this entity's relationship to the united states institute of peace, created in 1984 and funded annually by congress. the institute describes its work as  a vital investment in reducing violent international conflicts that threaten u.s. national security in its latest budget justification letter sent to congress.\n\ntwo more bills would require the united states to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.\n\nomar called it an international embarrassment that the united states has not signed onto the controversial united nations convention on the rights of the child.\n\nhowever, that agreement would severely undermine u.s. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from americans united for life in 2010:\n\nunder article vi of the united states constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme law of the land. therefore, ratification of the uncrc will make the document binding under american law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. this will also ultimately limit united states sovereignty by placing american family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.\n\nomar also called on the united states to join the international criminal court, a global entity that president donald trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by u.s. troops, afghan forces, and the taliban.\n\ntrump has denounced the icc, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its 'broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers,' reuters reported. washington revoked travel visas for icc personnel in response to its work on afghanistan.\n\nomar's press release touts support for the bills from left-wing heavyweights like ben rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to barack obama.\n\ncongresswoman omar is putting forward an ambitious and comprehensive package that outlines progressive approaches to some of the most important issues facing the united states and our world today, rhodes said.\n\nhuman rights watch's andrea prasow praised omar as a leader on the subject:  with an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.\n\nomar and rep. rashida tlaib (d-mi) were the first muslim women elected to congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. they are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as the squad, led by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) and including rep. ayanna pressley (d-ma). since her election, omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying israel has hypnotized the world, may allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of israel. days after taking her oath of office, omar spread a conspiracy theory that sen. lindsey graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. the next month, she was denounced by senior democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that aipac influences u.s. foreign policy with bribes and pro-israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. she ultimately kept her seat on the powerful house foreign affairs committee.\n\nmore recently, omar has been mired in more personal controversies. in late 2019, she filed for divorce from ahmed hirsi, the father of her children, amid swirling reports of an affair with democratic operative tim mynett. she is now facing scrutiny for alleged campaign payments to his consulting firm. likewise, long-simmering questions about her marriage to ahmed nur said elmi in 2009 — which critics have alleged was a marriage to her brother for immigration purposes — have reportedly reached the fbi.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter
a court in india ruled on monday that the term hindu bride must also include transgender women, thus directing authorities to register a marriage solemnized between a man and a transgender woman.\n\njustice g r swaminathan of the madras high court, the capital of tamil nadu state, issued a ruling on monday that the term bride as defined by the hindu marriage act must also include transgender women, who are biologically male. the case was brought by a man and his transgender partner after registration authorities refused to certify their marriage, citing section 5 of the hindu marriage act 1956 that states that a transgender woman cannot be considered a bride.\n\nswaminathan chose to discard the ruling by referring to cases such as the recent decriminalization of homosexuality while observing that equal rights are afforded to transgenders under the indian constitution.\n\nafter making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the hon'ble supreme court held that article 14 of the constitution of india which affirms that the state shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of india would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.\n\ntransgender persons fall within the expression 'person' and hence entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of state activity as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country, he continued.\n\n\n\nswaminathan observed that gender identity falls within the domain of her personal autonomy and involves her right to privacy and dignity, arguing that it was not for state authorities to question this self-determination of the second petitioner herein.\n\nwhen the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the hon'ble supreme court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the hindu marriage act, he added. one can have a civil marriage. one can also have a sacramental marriage. the petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. therefore, their fundamental right under article 25 has also been infringed in this case.\n\nswaminathan also took steps to outlaw gender reassignment surgeries on children who identify as intersex, saying that they required more time and maturity to make such a decision. however, he said the government must launch campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the issue so that parents and children did not feel a sense of shame.\n\nparents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled. any intersex child is entitled to stay within the folds of the family, he observed. the running away to the margins and beyond is a fatal journey that must be arrested. time has come when they are brought back from the margins to the mainstream.\n\ndespite being known for its ultra-conservative society, india has taken steps to implement various lgbt rights over recent years. last year, the supreme court overturned a ruling criminalizing homosexuality, while sexual reassignment surgery remains legal and readily accessible.\n\nfollow ben kew on facebook, twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
the u.s. bishops' conference (usccb) has again voiced its opposition to the equality act, warning it would discriminate against people of faith and inflict numerous legal and social harms on americans.\n\nin a strongly worded letter to the u.s. congress, the bishops assert the equality act would impose novel and divisive viewpoints regarding 'gender' on individuals and organizations while dismissing sexual difference and falsely presenting 'gender' as only a social construct.\n\nthe feb. 23 letter, signed by five leaders of the usccb, notes sex and gender can be distinguished but not separated, while denouncing underlying ideologies that attempt to sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality.\n\nrather than affirm human dignity in ways that meaningfully exceed existing practical protections, the equality act would discriminate against people of faith, they insist.\n\nbecause of its abolition of real sexual differences in favor of subjective gender identities, the proposed legislation would force girls and women to compete against boys and men for limited opportunities in school sports, and to share locker rooms and shower spaces with biological males who claim to identify as women, the bishops contend.\n\nmoreover, the act would exclude people from the careers and livelihoods that they love, just for maintaining the truth of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality and discriminate against individuals and religious organizations based on their different beliefs, they argue.\n\nin their litany of the many problems with the proposed law, the bishops also assert it would punish faith-based charities such as shelters and foster care agencies, and in turn their thousands of beneficiaries, simply because of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality.\n\nthe letter was signed by new york cardinal timothy dolan, chairman of the committee for religious liberty; oklahoma city archbishop paul s. coakley, chairman of the committee on domestic justice and human development; oakland bishop michael barber, chairman of the committee on catholic education; tulsa bishop david konderla, chairman of the subcommittee for the promotion and defense of marriage; and kansas city archbishop joseph naumann, chairman of the committee on pro-life activities.\n\nfollow @tdwilliamsrome
angelina jolie has filed for divorce from her longtime partner brad pitt, according to a report.\n\ntmz reports that the 41-year-old actress and united nations special envoy filed court papers monday citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.\n\nthe outlet further reports that jolie was unhappy with the way pitt, 52, was raising their children. the couple — who married in 2014 but have been together since 2004 — are parents to six children: maddox, 15, pax, 12, zahara, 11, shiloh, 10, and twins knox and vivenne, both 8.\n\na source close to the couple told tmz that jolie was extremely upset with pitt's parenting methods.\n\nan unnamed source also reportedly told the outlet that jolie was fed up with what the source said was his alleged use of marijuana and anger issues. the source added that jolie felt the children were in danger around pitt.\n\nmeanwhile, the new york post's page six reports that jolie had hired a private detective to spy on pitt on the set of his new london-set movie allied, where she suspected he had been cheating with co-star marion cotillard. the outlet reported that the private eye did catch pitt cheating with cotillard.\n\npage six also reported several other details related to the split: jolie reportedly wants to become more involved with her humanitarian work, while pitt wants to continue to make movies and enjoys hollywood parties. jolie appeared at the united nations just last week to lobby on behalf of syrian refugees.\n\nthe outlet further reported that pitt is closer to jolie's father, actor jon voight, than she is: jon's a hollywood guy, and she's been estranged. brad hangs out with her father more than she does, a source said.\n\njolie is reportedly seeking sole physical custody of their six children and asking a judge to grant visitation rights to pitt.\n\nthe couple — dubbed by celebrity tabloid outlets as brangelina — first met on the set of their 2003 thriller mr. and mrs. smith. they recently starred as a couple trying to repair their marriage in last year's jolie-directed drama by the sea.\n\njolie has reportedly retained attorney laura wasser, who represented actress amber heard in her high-profile divorce case against johnny depp earlier this summer.\n\nthis article has been updated with additional details.\n\nfollow daniel nussbaum on twitter: @dznussbaum
rep. jim jordan (r-oh) noted thursday on the floor of the u.s. house of representatives that the equality act, which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity, specifically disallows religious exemptions.\n\njordan was responding to a speech by rep. sean maloney (d-ny), who accused republicans of using freedom of religion as an excuse to hate on gay people, and claimed that religious freedom would still be protected under the equality act.\n\nbut jordan pointed to the text of the bill itself, which states: the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 (42 u.s.c. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. the religious freedom restoration act (rfra) was enacted to protect the first amendment right to the free exercise of religion except for compelling government interest.\n\nreligion has been at the heart of debates about same-sex marriage, sexual orientation, and gender identity. democrats tried to short-circuit that debate in the equality act, which implies that religion cannot be cited as a basis for discrimination.\n\nfollowing jordan, rep. andy biggs (r-az) argued that language in the text of the bill also attempts to create a statutory right to abortion by prohibiting discrimination regarding a related medical condition connected to pregnancy.\n\nthe equality act passed the house on a largely party-line vote, 224-206, with only three republicans joining democrats in favor.\n\nthe senate is considered unlikely to pass the equality act, for the reasons of religious liberty jordan mentioned.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news and the host of breitbart news sunday on sirius xm patriot on sunday evenings from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. et (4 p.m. to 7 p.m. pt). he is the author of the recent e-book, neither free nor fair: the 2020 u.s. presidential election. his recent book, red november, tells the story of the 2020 democratic presidential primary from a conservative perspective. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
a california bakery owned by christians has been forced to take down its website and social media accounts after a bombardment of criticism and a boycott followed their decision not to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding involving two lesbians.\n\ncathy miller, the owner of tastries bakery in bakersfield, ca, explained that she was not refusing to serve a certain sort of customer, but rather to patronize a certain sort of event that goes against her religious convictions as a christian.\n\na ceremony, when you're getting married is in the eyes of the lord, okay, and that's a celebration of a union that god has brought together and that's a whole lot different than coming in and wanting a cookie, miller explained.\n\neileen del rio claimed that she and her girlfriend suffered discrimination because tastries bakery refused to grant them a wedding cake tasting due to the millers' christian belief in marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\n\ndel rio wrote about the incident on facebook, bringing down a bombardment of negativity against miller. as a result, the owners were forced to take down the tastries bakery website and facebook page.\n\nso we go to this bakery a week ago to sign up for tasting and choose our wedding cake. the owner met with us today to set up the process, del rio wrote. well this rude ass person says i will make your order but i don't condone same sex marriages and will have no part in this process. oh but you want to take my order and give it another bakery so that bakery can do it.\n\nshe don't condone same sex marriages so refused to make our wedding cake and set up our order. she wanted all our information to send to another bakery so they could make it, she added, along with a hashtag suggesting the owner was probably a supporter of donald trump.\n\nmiller said that she has nothing against gay people but there are certain activities she cannot support because of who she is.\n\nhere at tastries, we love everyone, miller said. my husband and i are christians and we know that god created everyone and he created everyone equal so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups of people.\n\nthere are just certain things that violate my conscience, miller said.\n\nfor years, tastries has been referring gay customers who want a wedding cake to a competitor called gimmee some sugar, so they can receive the service they ask for.\n\ni'm really hurt by this. i don't think we should be picked on because of our beliefs, miller said.\n\nin the last two days, lgbt activists have loaded a barrage of negative reviews against the bakery on yelp and tripadvisor in an effort to tank the business.\n\nlast may, president trump issued an executive order promoting free speech and religious liberty, in which he stated that the executive branch would vigorously enforce federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\n\nthe founders envisioned a nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the federal government, he said, noting that the fundamental right to religious liberty is americans' first freedom.\n\nfederal law protects the freedom of americans and their organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life without undue interference by the federal government. the executive branch will honor and enforce those protections, he said.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
a british police officer called a charity to ask if it were acceptable for an iraqi man to date a 12-year-old girl because he wanted to be culturally sensitive when dealing with a suspected paedophile.\n\nan unnamed police detective called the charity karma nirvana, which tackles forced marriage and other forms of 'honour-based' abuse, after he had arrested a 26-year-old iraqi man who said that in his culture, it was acceptable for him to be in a relationship with a child, according to the charity's call logs seen by the times.\n\naccording to the call log, the policeman said the accused is stating that it is 'completely acceptable in my culture to be with a 12-year-old'.\n\nthe record added that the officer 'just wished to know if it is accepted in iraqi culture to be with a 12-year-old girl' as he wished to be 'culturally sensitive'.\n\nthe charity advised that he deal with the iraqi in the same way they would deal with any other suspected child sex predator.\n\nkarma nirvana said that this call showed the dangers of authorities filtering serious crimes through a 'cultural sensitivity' lens, for fear of being perceived as racist.\n\nchain migration: uk govt 'turns blind eye' to forced marriage, hands visas to foreign rapists https://t.co/exxaj9pqd2 — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) august 2, 2018\n\njasvinder sanghera, the charity's founder, said that we've got a number of professionals who are turning a blind eye. they don't want to rock the multicultural boat.\n\nthe revelation is one of many to be released by the times after it published a series of reports detailing authorities turning a blind eye to forced and underage marriages by predominately south asians.\n\nit was revealed this week that government officials had been handing visas to the husbands of girls who have been forcibly married, raped, and impregnated abroad, allowing them to settle in britain permanently; at times the victims were mentally disabled.\n\nof the 3,800 reports of forced marriages or children and young people at risk of being forced into marriage, over the past three years to the government's home office, the police have charged less than 80 suspects and the judicial system has convicted suspects in just three cases.
hungary has offered a model to the west of how to effectively address the widespread demographic crisis, writes catholic university of america theology professor chad pecknold.\n\nwhile european nations languish with rapidly declining birthrates, hungary stands out with rising marriage rates, falling abortions, and its highest birthrate in 20 years, pecknold notes in an essay in the catholic herald thursday.\n\nmarriage is up by 43 percent since 2010, while divorce has dropped by 22.5 percent in the same period. this demographic turnaround has not been an accident, but the fruit of deliberate programs to promote marriage and the family while defending hungary's cultural identity and christian roots.\n\nafter we won the election in 2010 with a two-thirds majority, we decided to build a family-friendly country and to strengthen families raising children, said hungary's minister for the family, katalin novak.\n\nstanding firm in its position despite fierce opposition from the socialist left, the orbán government enacted legislation resulting in a comprehensive family-support system, a family-friendly tax system, a housing program, 800,000 new jobs, and many opportunities to create a balance between life and work, ms. novak stated.\n\nas breitbart news has reported, the orbán government has introduced seven family-friendly government programs encouraging hungarians to have children in response to the european union's mass migration agenda.\n\nwe are living in times when fewer and fewer children are being born throughout europe. people in the west are responding to this with immigration, prime minister orbán said at the state of the nation address in budapest in february.\n\nhungarians see this in a different light. we do not need numbers, but hungarian children, the fidesz party leader added.\n\nthe new law will come into effect july 1 and includes pro-family incentives such as a 3,000 euro mortgage reduction for a second child, a 12,000 euro reduction for a third child, a car-purchasing program for large families, and comprehensive daycare.\n\nas of 2020, mothers with four or more children will enjoy a lifetime personal income tax exemption.\n\nhungary is proving that pro-family policies are better for nations than those policies which deracinate and diminish the family by the whims of ideological dictate, pecknold observes.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
as president obama's last year in office winds down and he comes to the realization that he won't be able to close the guantanamo bay terrorist detention facility like he promised in 2008, he's been busy transferring inmates to other countries as a fallback plan. this month, obama has sent osama bin laden's alleged bodyguard to the country of montenegro.\n\nabdel malik ahmed abdel wahab al-rahabi has been held at gitmo for 14 years but will now get a change of scenery, with the administration deciding that the bin laden associate is no longer a threat to the u.s. and recommending his transfer. and according to nbc news, the department of defense insists that the transfer is consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures.\n\nannouncing the move, the administration thanked the small eastern european nation for taking the accused terrorist off america's hands\n\nmontenegro, a small country situated between bosnia, and herzegovina, and albania, and across from italy on the adriatic sea, said it would release al-rahabi once it takes custody of him, allowing him to return to his family.\n\nal-rahabi was detained in 2001 by pakistani forces then transferred to gitmo a month after his arrest.\n\npentagon documents say the prisoner is related to bin laden by marriage and was trained to hijack airliners and fly a suicide mission in conjunction with the 9/11 attacks. for whatever reason, the detainee never committed to the suicide mission.\n\nclaiming to close the guantanamo facility was one of the first actions obama took when he first entered office in 2008 when he signed an executive order promising he would shut the facility down in the first year of his presidency.\n\nclosing the detention center was one of obama's main campaign promises, but in spite of his promises and the executive order he immediately issued upon entering the white house, obama never did shutter the facility. instead, he began a campaign of transferring prisoners from the facility to nations that volunteered to take them.\n\nbut since he began his program of freeing prisoners by transferring them, well over 100 have simply returned to the battlefields to kill westerners in general and americans in particular.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
the vatican under pope francis is consolidating its opposition to gender theory, the notion that maleness and femaleness can be separated from biological sex, according to veteran vatican analyst john l. allen, jr.\n\nalthough prior popes were also critical of gender theory, allen writes in a march 15 essay, opposition has intensified on francis's watch.\n\nthe pope has repeatedly warned against the dangers of ideologies that separate sexual identity from biology, decrying gender theory as against the nature of things. it seems, allen writes, that folks at the vatican have picked up on francis' war on gender theory and have decided to throw themselves into the fray.\n\nas an example, allen cites a conference at rome's santa croce university this week that featured a forceful critique of gender theory, notably during a panel chaired by german archbishop georg gänswein, aide to emeritus pope benedict xvi and currently the prefect of the papal household.\n\nthe paper was prepared by canon lawyer vincenzo turchi, which served to throw some doctrinal heft behind the pope's sometimes casual statements on the subject.\n\nallen condenses the church's opposition to gender theory into three bullet points, all contained in turchi's talk:\n\n– it undermines the objective moral norms governing sexual behavior by proposing that sexual identity and orientation are not given in nature, but rather the result of contingent historical and cultural factors.\n\n– in the hands of educators, it jeopardizes the right of parents to be the primary teachers of their children.\n\n– it threatens traditional christian morality by casting it as discriminatory and bigoted.\n\ngender theory is based on the primacy of culture over nature, turchi's paper read. since gender theory views nature and biology data as marginal, sexual differences are fluid and changeable and can be fashioned on the basis of individual self-determination.\n\ncommenting on educational programs where gender theory is currently employed, turchi spoke of a pilot curriculum in spain where children are encouraged to pretend that they are members of the opposite sex to break down their natural identification with their bodies.\n\nthis includes acting out fairy tales, where boys are encouraged to play the part of little red riding hood, while girls are invited to play the part of the wolf, allen notes.\n\nadded to this, turchi cited developments in northern europe, such as the adoption of gender-neutral pronouns in swedish schools and sexual education in denmark that includes the possibility for guest speakers such as a transsexual prostitute.\n\nfrancis denounced gender theory for its denial of the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman and for its dream of a society without sexual differences in a lengthy 2017 teaching letter on marriage and the family called the joy of love (amoris laetitia).\n\nan appreciation of our body as male or female, he wrote, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves and is far from the unisex utopia that some would like to impose.\n\nefforts to blot out sexual differences based on anatomy are symptomatic of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he added.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
democrat presidential candidate sen. elizabeth warren told attendees at a town hall in cedar rapids, iowa sunday that, if she is elected president, her education secretary will have to be approved by a transgender child.\n\nwhen a supporter told warren public schools need to teach more about lgbtq history and sex education, the massachusetts senator replied her education secretary would have to be interviewed by a transgender child.\n\nc-span\n\ni have two qualifications that i have talked about over and over for my secretary of education, warren said. the first, it has to be someone who has taught in a public school.\n\nthen, warren said that since the question came from a young trans person who asked about a welcoming community, she would have that trans child interview the nominee for education secretary and look for the child's approval:\n\ni said it starts with the secretary of education who has a lot to do with where we spend our money, with what gets advanced in our public schools, with what the standards are. and i said i'm gonna have a secretary of education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf and only if this person believes that our secretary or secretary of education nominee is – is committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone, will that person actually be advanced to be secretary of education.\n\nwarren has been reaching out to lgbt voters by condemning christian schools that hold and teach a biblical worldview of human sexuality and marriage.\n\nstates should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-lgbtq+ policies. we must ensure every kid—especially lgbtq+ kids—can get a high-quality public education. https://t.co/hxkap5ofjm — elizabeth warren (@ewarren) january 26, 2020\n\nas breitbart news also reported in january, if elected, warren has also vowed to fill at least half of her cabinet with women and non-binary individuals – or those who claim they are neither male nor female.\n\nhowever, as gallup has observed, only 4.5 percent of u.s. adults identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (lgbt) in 2017.\n\nfrom the beginning of the trump administration, democrats have continually criticized current secretary of education betsy devos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher. most democrat 2020 candidates have represented the views of the teachers' unions whose leadership has condemned the administration's support for school choice, viewing it as a threat to public schools.
washington, dc – chairman chuck grassley's (r-ia) senate judiciary committee (sjc) sent four more judicial nominees to the senate floor and plans to pass another four at its next business meeting, advancing president trump's persistent march to keep his campaign promise of reshaping the federal judiciary.\n\nsenators on thursday voted to send three federal trial court nominees and one federal appeals court nominee to the full senate, where they are expected to be approved. in a sign of the democrats' possible weakening resolve to uniformly oppose all trump judicial picks, three of the nominees received some democratic votes in support. the appellate nominee, kurt engelhardt for the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit, was approved 15-6.\n\nthe only one approved on a straight 11-10 party-line vote was howard nielson, nominated for the u.s. district court for the district of utah. nielson is a well-respected former law clerk to a top appellate judge and then worked at the elite office of legal counsel (olc) at the u.s. department of justice.\n\ndemocrats are opposing nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the supreme court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at olc defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. he is a partner at cooper & kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, chuck cooper, who headed olc as its assistant attorney general under president ronald reagan and attorney general ed meese. cooper is also a savvy political figure in d.c. and a close ally and personal lawyer to attorney general jeff sessions.\n\neven nielson's critics acknowledge that he is well-qualified for a judgeship, and attempts to stop him will likely look like partisan obstruction that continues to diminish democrats' political currency. he is expected to be confirmed by the full senate.\n\nsjc held over four more nominations to be voted on at its next business meeting.\n\nthese include michael brennan for the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. brennan's nomination has been slow-walked because home-state sen. tammy baldwin (d-wi)—an aggressive partisan who is vulnerable for re-election in 2018—has refused to return her blue slip consenting to a committee hearing.\n\nblue slips are a courtesy that senate democrats have abused during the trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky) led the full senate to confirm the first trump nominee to be initially blocked by a blue slip, judge david stras to the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit.\n\nbrennan and the other held-over nominees are expected to eventually be confirmed as well. despite sen. chuck schumer's (d-ny) efforts to derail president trump's agenda, the president's aggressive promise to reorient the nation's courts continues apace.\n\nken klukowski is senior legal editor for breitbart news. follow him on twitter @kenklukowski.

the ongoing saga of lgbt protests of an upcoming chick-fil-a restaurant on campus at duquesne university, a catholic college in pittsburgh, has taken on biblical dimensions as a test-case of safe spaces and microaggressions in american higher education.\n\naccording to its mission statement, duquesne university is a catholic university founded by members of the congregation of the holy spirit, dedicated to serving god while espousing a profound concern for moral and spiritual values. it also professes a commitment to an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity.\n\nfor its part, chick-fil-a ceo management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment.\n\nin 2012, dan cathy, ceo of chick-fil-a, stated: we are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. we are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. we give god thanks for that.\n\nwe know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.\n\nlambda gay-straight alliance, the lgbt student organization on campus, considers chick-fil-a's commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn't want to.\n\nat the march 26 meeting, lambda executive board member niko martini proposed that the student government association (sga) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of chick-fil-a as a dining option for students. martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not lambda's.\n\nchick-fil-a has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, martini said. i think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.\n\nmartini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.\n\nmeanwhile lambda president rachel coury expressed worries that the safety of lgbt students might be at risk.\n\ni've tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the lgbtq+ community, coury said. so i fear that with the chick-fil-a being in options that maybe people will feel that safe place is at risk.\n\ndebate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the duquesne duke, the university's campus newspaper.\n\nin an interview on fox and friends, retired u.s. army ranger sean parnell, an alumnus of duquesne university, minced no words in expressing his dissent from the contemporary environment on the campus of his alma mater.\n\nthey're a bunch of babies. college is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. who doesn't want as an undergrad chick-fil-a on their campus? i would have killed for a c on my campus when i was at duquesne, he said.\n\nmy message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world, he said. if you're going to be successful in this life after you leave college you've got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions. you will never be a ceo of a major company or an entrepreneur or a manager if you are not willing to work with people different than you.\n\nhostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by supreme court justice samuel alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 obergefell v. hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land.\n\nalito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.\n\nit will be used, he wrote presciently, to vilify americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
boston (ap) — jack welch, who transformed general electric co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. he was 84.\n\nhis death was confirmed monday by ge. the cause of death was renal failure, his wife suzy told the new york times.\n\nwelch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as ge's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001. he personified the so-called cult of the ceo during the late-1990s boom, when ge's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.\n\na chemical engineer by training, welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. during his tenure, ge's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.\n\nwelch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping ge turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid ge of unprofitable businesses.\n\nbusiness success and outspokenness brought him wide fame.\n\nin 1999, fortune magazine named welch as its manager of the century.\n\nfor his first book, jack: straight from the gut, welch received a $7.1 million advance. although released on the very morning of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the book became a best-seller, and led to frequent speaking engagements where he took his candor on stage.\n\nfrom the day i joined ge to the day i was named ceo, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor, welch wrote in 'straight from the gut.' i was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career … and i'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work.\n\nwelch did not slow down after leaving ge.\n\nhe became a senior advisor with private equity firm clayton, dubilier & rice in 2001. he also taught a course on business leadership at mit's sloan school of management in 2006. in 2009, welch founded the jack welch management institute, an online mba program that is now part of strayer university.\n\nwhile welch was known for being hypercompetitive, he also stressed giving everyone a fair shake.\n\nin the 2005 book, winning, welch wrote that he would like to be remembered as a huge advocate of candor and meritocracy, and believing everyone deserves a chance. and i'd like to be remembered for trying to make the case that you can never let yourself be a victim.\n\nalong with welch's fame came greater scrutiny. welch found himself defending his retirement compensation. amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of welch's ge perks emerged in court papers during his 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years, jane beasley. he received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of ge's planes, office space and financial services.\n\nafter the perks became public, welch reimbursed the company for many of them, and paid for use of aircraft and other services.\n\nhis first marriage, to carolyn, ended amicably in divorce after 28 years in 1987. plans for his second divorce were disclosed shortly after harvard business review editor suzy wetlaufer revealed she had become romantically involved with welch while working on a story about him.\n\nwelch didn't blame the media for the attention the affair generated.\n\nchrist, if i was a journalist, i'd write a scandalous story, welch told the cbs television news magazine 60 minutes in a 2005 interview. i mean, it's a good story, but i don't care. i fell in love.\n\nwetlaufer resigned the harvard editing post in 2002 because of a furor caused by her relationship with welch. in a january 2012 interview with cnn's piers morgan, when asked how he persuaded wetlaufer to marry him, welch replied, my charm and probably my wallet.\n\nwe had a little scandal at the beginning, he continued. and it's been the greatest 10 years of our lives.\n\nthe couple wrote a regular column, called the welch way, in business week magazine for four years. they also wrote management books, including winning in 2005.\n\nthe welches resumed writing a regular column in 2012, this time for reuters. they used the column to dole out advice for business and political figures, including facebook ceo mark zuckerberg and gop presidential candidate mitt romney, whom they supported.\n\nwelch was also active on twitter, where he opined on everything from politics to business to sports and had 1.4 million followers.\n\nsome of those opinions generated controversy.\n\nhe questioned a monthly jobs report in october 2012 that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. the report came two days after president barack obama had performed poorly in his first debate with romney and a month before the election.\n\nunbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. these chicago guys will do anything…can't debate so change numbers.\n\nobama hailed from chicago. while some republican members of congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former labor department officials from the bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the data.\n\nin his writing and speaking, welch shared the wisdom he gained in a ge career that began right after he left grad school. he quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and ceo in 1981, at age 45. welch quickly shook up ge, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. that earned him the unwanted nickname neutron jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. welch also divested ge of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be no. 1 or 2 in their markets. the early moves dismantled ge's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.\n\nhe's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, noel tichy, the author of a 1993 book on welch and a former leader of ge's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. he'll make snap judgments. he's a human being that has temper tantrums.\n\nwith all that, i think he's the greatest business leader i ever met, tichy said.\n\nand welch freely acknowledged his mistakes. one was calma, a computer design firm that ge bought in 1981. the company wound up losing $50 million annually until ge sold it in 1988.\n\nwelch delayed his retirement for one last bold move, a $41 billion bid to buy honeywell international.\n\nwelch predicted easy government approval for the largest acquisition ge had ever attempted, but european regulators rejected the deal as bad for competition.\n\nin 1986, welch made one of his boldest moves, a $6.4 billion acquisition of rca, including the nbc television network. the deal energized ge, which made hundreds more acquisitions as the company moved aggressively into financial services, medical equipment and jet engines.\n\none of welch's greatest accomplishments, his supporters say, is the talent ge has created by placing a premium on developing leaders. many former ge executives now lead fortune 500 companies.\n\namong the leaders welch groomed was his ge successor, jeffrey immelt. welch has written that picking his successor leading up to the 2001 leadership transition was the most important and agonizing decision he ever made.\n\nin april 2008, immelt became the target of welch's blunt talk when ge missed a quarterly earnings target, a month after immelt had promised investors the company would meet its goals. the disappointment sent ge shares down nearly 13% in a single day, prompting welch to say that he would get a gun out and shoot immelt if he allowed ge to miss earnings targets again.\n\nafter making the comment on cnbc, welch went back on the ge-owned cable station the next day to renounce his harsh talk, saying, nothing, nothing, nothing is as disgusting to me as some old ceo chirping away about how things aren't as good under the new guy as they were under him.\n\nand he never strayed far from ge.\n\nwhen i last saw him, what i remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'so how exactly are you running the company?' jack was still in it – committed to ge's success. and to have jack welch ask me how i am running ge is pretty humbling, said ge's current ceo, larry culp.\n\nhe will be deeply missed by me and the entire ge team. and we'll continue to honor his legacy by doing exactly what jack would want us to do: win. we extend our thoughts and sympathies to suzy and his family during this time.\n\nborn nov. 19, 1935, as the only child of an irish working-class family in salem, mass., welch graduated from the university of massachusetts-amherst in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. he later obtained master's and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering from the university of illinois, finishing in 1960.\n\nwelch joined ge that year as a junior engineer in pittsfield, mass.\n\nhe rose through the ranks, and built ge's plastics business into one of the company's fastest growing business units. he became a senior vice president in 1977, and vice chairman in 1979. in 1995, welch suffered chest pains and underwent heart bypass surgery.\n\nthe setback led to speculation that ge could be seeking a quick successor to welch, but he remained at the helm another six years.\n\nwelch moved to boston after his career at ge, living in a townhouse in the city's beacon hill section.\n\nin his later years, welch also devoted more time to passions such as baseball — specifically, the boston red sox.\n\nhe is survived by his third wife, suzy welch, and four children from his first marriage.
the arizona republican party will vote on resolutions to censure cindy mccain, former sen. jeff flake (r-az), and gov. doug ducey, a republican, when it meets on january 23.\n\nmccain, the widow of the late sen. john mccain (r-az), endorsed president-elect joe biden over president donald trump in the 2020 election.\n\non tuesday, arizona central reported the text of the draft resolution to censure and dissolve any connections between the republican party and mccain:\n\nwhereas, cindy hensley mccain, the wife of the late arizona us senator john mccain, has supported leftist causes such as gay marriage, growth of the administrative state, and others that run counter to republican values, a republican form of government, and the us constitution; whereas, cindy mccain has failed to support conservative republican candidates such as president trump; whereas, cindy mccain has supported globalist policies and candidates, including democrats such as joe biden, in direct opposition to republican values, the interests of the american people, and the constitution of the united states; whereas, cindy mccain has condemned president trump for his criticism of her husband and erroneously placed behaviors over actual presidential results; and\n\non tuesday, republican national committee chairman ronna mcdaniel issued a statement opposing the censure resolution of mccain.\n\nobviously we are upset that a prominent republican would support joe biden whose beliefs are the opposite of what our party stands for, but the language in this resolution is abhorrent, mcdaniel said in the statement.\n\nmy hope is that the arizona republican party will not entertain it. this does nothing to grow our party or put us in a better position to win in 2022, mcdaniel added.\n\n12 news subsequently reported that the language of the draft censure resolution has been modified:\n\nmcdaniel was reacting to an initial draft of the mccain resolution that included inflammatory language about both cindy mccain and her late husband, sen. john mccain. that language was removed from the resolution that will go to a vote in two weeks. the chairman of the republican party nationally understands that the chairman of the republican party locally is a complete goofball, said grant woods, a former arizona attorney general and longtime mccain family friend. . . sen. mccain was censured by the state party in 2014. he went on to win re-election two years later, defeating current party chair kelli ward in the gop primary.\n\ni'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from arizona gop chairman kelli ward . . . she's shown how attacking republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both senate elections to replace jeff flake and my husband john mccain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in democrat wins, mccain said in a statement released to the arizona republic late tuesday.\n\nward is a former state legislator who ran unsuccessfully for the u.s. senate in arizona and is a strong supporter of president trump.\n\non wednesday, the wall street journal said resolutions addressing flake and ducey will also be considered at the january 23 meeting of the arizona republican party.\n\na separate resolution to censure flake cites his opposition to president trump's re-election, and a third resolution to censure ducey cites his failure to remove emergency coronavirus pandemic restrictions.
south bend mayor and democratic 2020 presidential candidate pete buttigieg suggested tuesday that vice president mike pence is not as sincere in his christian faith as he claims to be, judging based on his political alliance with president donald trump.\n\nthe section in my book about mike pence begins with that quote from lincoln where he says, both sides in great contests invoke god, think and hope that god's on their side. both may be, and one must be, wrong, buttigieg told father edward beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for cnn. the idea that god wants somebody like mike pence to be the cheerleader for a president largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give god very little credit.\n\nmichael d'antonio, co-author of the shadow president: the truth about mike pence, told cnn in august 2018 that pence believes him becoming vice president was divine intervention. absolutely everything that mike pence does is oriented towards him becoming president… by the time he left high school, he had decided he was going to be president of the united states.\n\nand as he rose through life, becoming a member of congress and then governor of indiana, he actually sort of heard in his being god's direction, d'antonio told new day co-host john berman. the author went on to claim how pence thought that god was calling him to now be vice president and function as a president-in-waiting.\n\nin his discussion with beck, buttigieg took aim at indiana's religious freedom restoration act, legislation that pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015. the law allows both individuals and business to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their religion has been burdened. the small town mayor called it a license to harm others in the name of religion.\n\nit was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? making it easier to harm people in its name?\n\nin another portion of the pair's discussion, buttigieg spoke about why he believes same-sex marriage is a contentious issue in religious circles.\n\nit saddens me because when i think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. it is morally one of the best things in my life. being married to chasten makes me a better person. i would even say it moves me closer to god.\n\nand so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when god is love, we are taught, he went on. of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. so it's a painful thing to watch.\n\nif you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then i think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. i've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. and i guess i believe it ought to be.\n\nthe interview comes after buttigieg announced his campaign had raised more than $7 million in the first quarter.
actor jason lee has become the latest celebrity to confirm he is no longer practicing scientology.\n\nthe 46-year-old my name is earl star, who moved to denton, texas with his wife ceren alkac and their children last year, confirmed his exit from the controversial religion in an interview with local outlet the dentonite this weekend.\n\nthe actor told the outlet that, contrary to rumors that have been floated about his move to texas, he has no plans to open a scientology or any other religious center in the city.\n\nif ceren and i had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's. and being that we don't practice scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a scientology center, the actor said.\n\nquite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he added. we're not here to buy up or change or take over denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. we're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nin an essay for gawker last year, lee's first wife carmen llywelyn blamed scientology for the breakup of their marriage. lee and llewelyn were married from 1995 to 2001.\n\ni was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work, she wrote.  i did what i thought was right. but i made the mistake of immersing myself completely in his world. i did what so many other people who join scientology do: i lost all sense of individual identity in the name of the cult.\n\nlee joins several other recent high-profile defectors from the controversial church, including actress leah remini, musician lisa marie presley, director paul haggis, and actor jason beghe.\n\nin march of last year, documentary filmmaker alex gibney released an hbo exposé on the controversial religion called going clear: scientology and the prison of belief. the film — which won three emmy awards — detailed the controversial behind-the-scenes working of the church and made several explosive allegations regarding its most devoted celebrity adherents, including tom cruise and john travolta.\n\nfollow daniel nussbaum on twitter: @dnzussbaum
britain's labour party is demanding the uk government impose an imperialistic diktat upon the predominantly black citizens of bermuda for refusing to adhere to the liberal-left's same-sex marriage demands.\n\nhelen goodman — labour's shadow foreign office minister — said the devolved, democratic decision taken by bermuda to repeal gay marriage laws — turns same-sex couples into second class citizens, implying force should be used to impose gay marriage laws.\n\nfor that to happen anyone in the world would be shameful. for it to happen in a british territory, for the legislation signed by a british governor and permitted by a british foreign secretary makes us complicit in something which this house has repeatedly voted against, she argued.\n\napparently imperialism is fine, but only in the pursuit of leftist goals like those of the lgbtqii++ lobby, in a mostly christian nation.\n\nthe british government called bermuda's decision disappointing but resisted getting involved despite the island's status as a british overseas territory. it's almost as if the brits retain some knowledge about holding together an empire. if bermuda were in the european union, there'd have probably been some kind of sanctions, or perhaps a gay-migrant quota by now.\n\nrenowned mastermind (click it) david lammy mp somehow managed to invoke slavery into his pro-imperialist arguments:\n\nthe first slaves we brought to bermuda in 1620, oppressed, segregated, discriminated against… and that is why leaders like nelson mandela, desmond tutu and barack obama have not just fought for race rights, but they have fought for rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.\n\nthis country has been one of the world leaders on this subject – so if this is not the issue on which to refuse assent i don't know which is.\n\nthe green party's caroline lucas called it an absolute scandal that britain was not willing to enforce lgbt ideals on another nation.\n\nthe rights of gay couples remain the same as those of straight married couples in bermuda, but only the verbiage applied to each type of partnership is different.\n\nin 2016, over 60 per cent of bermudans rejected both same sex marriages and same sex civil unions in a plebiscite held on the same day as britain's brexit referendum. the votes were not binding as they did not pass the 50 per cent turnout threshold. nevertheless the government sought to compromise on the matter, protecting lgbt rights and attempting to respect the will of the people vis a vis marriage as an institution.\n\nthe new rules — to add further irony — were drafted and passed by the progressive labour party government in bermuda, a nation of just over 60,000 people.\n\nwalton brown, bermuda's minister of home affairs, said this week he was pleased with the decision as governor john rankin signed it into law.\n\nhere's the icing on the forcibly-baked-by-threat-of-imprisonment-same-sex marriage cake: rankin is a 30+ year career diplomat from the british government, propelled into high office by prime minister tony blair's government in 2003 when he became britain's consul-general in boston. he has since served in sri lanka and the maldives, nepal, and now in bermuda.\n\nraheem kassam is the editor in chief of breitbart london
the home office is allowing women with severe mental disabilities to be forcibly married and raped, in both britain and pakistan, so that foreign men can obtain a visa and stay in the country.\n\nmigrant and muslim families reportedly believe that marrying their disabled children to foreigners will secure them a carer — and are being allowed to because authorities are too politically correct to invene, according to critics.\n\nthe victims include a woman with the mental age of a 7-year-old allowed to marry in a british registry office to a pakistani man who had overstayed his student visa, the times reports.\n\nauthorities had been aware of the case for over ten years and had received warnings the family of the man was paying around £20,000 to the woman's family because he wanted to stay in the united kingdom.\n\nthe woman had been forced into marriage twice already abroad, beaten, and raped, but council officials allowed the british wedding as they were concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background of those involved, according to court documents.\n\nanother muslim woman with a very significant degree of learning disability was forcibly married to a cousin in bangladesh and raped, before the abuser was handed a british visa.\n\nat a hearing about the case in the court of protection, in 2012, a judge said the victim's husband was physically very rough and abusive, smacking her head, shaking her, and yanking her eyelid.\n\nhe added: i watched the wedding video and [the victim] was slumped in a chair almost comatose.\n\nchain migration: uk govt 'turns blind eye' to forced marriage, hands visas to foreign rapists https://t.co/exxaj97pes — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) august 2, 2018\n\nthe migrant she was forced to marry twice failed to get a visa and an immigration judge said that her ability to understand and sponsor him was very much in doubt. however, she was then forced to live with him and was raped and impregnated.\n\nher parents were devout muslims who saw nothing wrong with the arrangement, spoke little english, and were very largely insulated from mainstream english society and mistrustful of non-bengalis the court heard.\n\nthe wedding was finally annulled and the child was taken in to care.\n\nin a similar case the following year, mr justice holman said: i have been told there are a number of incapacitated adults who have been the subject of arranged or forced marriages and that it is important to send a strong signal to the muslim and sikh communities that arranged marriages, where one party is mentally incapacitated, simply will not be tolerated.\n\nrachel clawson, a former social worker and university of nottingham academic specialising in forced marriage cases with disabled victims, told the times:\n\nwe've come across all sorts of abusive issues where families have basically sold their son or daughter. because families don't see these as forced marriages, lots of practitioners don't see them as forced marriages either.\n\nthey're worried about being perceived as racist or culturally insensitive. most marriages take place overseas and people get visas to come over.\n\nreport: ex-labour councillor and immigration lawyer asama javed is forced-marriage fixer for girls as young as 15 https://t.co/fchon70o39 — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) august 2, 2018
mark anthony conditt died on wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. less than 12 hours later, information about who the austin serial bomber is beginning to emerge.\n\nthe man described by his former employer as quiet and introverted went on a three-week rampage that left two people dead, five people injured, and people across austin, travis county, and fedex stores and processing facilities terrorized.\n\neducation:\n\nconditt's family homeschooled him before he graduated and attended austin community college. he attended the local college for about two years, but did not graduate, kvue reported. his formal education at the school ended in 2012.\n\nduring his college years, conditt appears to have written some conservative blog posts as part of an assignment, nbc news reported. the blog, defining my stance, provided a platform for a host postings ranging from anti-gay marriage to his positions on free abortions to why sex offender registrations should be ended. the posts were allegedly authored by a mark a. conditt, but nbc news said they were unable to confirm with school officials if the bomber actually wrote the posts.\n\nemployment:\n\nconditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. he worked for crux manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at austin community college, the austin abc affiliate reported. his former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. he reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. however, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, crux manufacturing let him go in august 2017.\n\nhis former employers described him as a quiet and introverted man who would prioritize things in his own way, kvue reported.\n\nconditt listed work as a computer repair technician, according to his profile on a job recruiting website, the austin american statesman reported.\n\ntexas governor greg abbott told kxan's phil prazan that conditt was unemployed when he died and had no military background.\n\npolitics:\n\nthe college blog posts allegedly written by conditt paint a picture of a politically conservative person.\n\ni am not that politically inclined. i view myself as a conservative, but i don't think i have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states. the reasons i am taking this class is because i want to understand the us government, and i hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\n\nagain, nbc could not confirm is the same mark a. conditt authored the posts on this blogsite.\n\nsome of the headlines on the 2012 blog read:\n\nwhy gay marriage should be illegal\n\nmy view on free abortions\n\nwhy we might want to consider doing away with sex offender registration\n\nan argument for the death penalty\n\npersonality:\n\nconditt's neighbors paint a picture not dissimilar to that of his former employer. jeff reeb told nbc news that conditt was a very normal kid and that his family was extremely nice.\n\nreeb told the statesman that he struggled to wrap his mind about conditt's actions. i know this is a cliché but i just can't imagine that, he explained about conditt's involvement in the bombings. he said his grandson grew up with conditt and they played together.\n\nhe is reported to be the oldest of four children.\n\nthe bombings:\n\nthere is no reported criminal history in conditt's past, several news outlets reported. that clear recorded ended on march 2 when conditt allegedly delivered a package to the northeast austin home of anthony house. the package exploded and killed the 39-year-old black man.\n\non march 12, conditt struck again by killing 17-year-old draylen mason in east austin when a package exploded after he brought it inside his home. mason's mother was also injured in the attack. a few hours later, conditt also injured a 75-year-old hispanic woman after she picked up a package on her front steps.\n\non march 19, two other young men were injured when conditt changed his tactics. this time a tripwire bomb exploded — sending the two men to a local hospital.\n\naustin interim police chief brian manley told reporters that investigators believe the use of a tripwire in the fourth bomb shows a higher level of sophistication than already been demonstrated. he said it also indicates a shift in the serial bomber's strategy of targeting specific people to a more random style.\n\nthe randomness expanded when a package exploded at a fedex processing facility in schertz, texas. a woman suffered ringing in her ears after the package exploded on an automated conveyor belt near her work location. police tracked down a second package at a fedex ground facility in east austin. police later determined that package was an unexploded device.\n\nthe packages appeared to have been shipped from a fedex store in sunset valley, texas, near the location of the fourth bombing.\n\nu.s. house homeland security committee chairman mike mccaul (r-tx) told the statesman that federal investigators obtained videos that could possibly show a suspect connected to the schertz bombing.\n\nmccaul told reporters that he hoped the bomber's biggest mistake was going through fedex.\n\nit was.\n\nless than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from pflugerville as the suspect. using cell phone technology, police tracked conditt to a motel parking lot in neighboring round rock. a few hours later, conditt killed himself by exploding a device inside his car.\n\nmotivation:\n\nthis is what we do not know about mark conditt. police are continuing to investigate the young man's background and his pflugerville home to search for clues as to why conditt would suddenly launch a bombing attack that would kill two people, injur six others, and eventually take his own life.

actor terry crews detailed his life-long battle with an addiction to pornography and revealed how it almost derailed his marriage in a three-part video series posted to facebook.\n\nthe 47-year-old former nfl player and brooklyn nine-nine star released his latest dirty little secret facebook video on tuesday. in the first video posted earlier this month, the actor revealed he went to rehab for his addiction, and said it had really, really messed up life in a lot of ways.\n\ndirty little secret posted by terry crews on thursday, february 11, 2016\n\nit became a thing where i didn't tell anybody, crews says in the first video. it was my secret, nobody knew, and that allowed it to grow, and it got bad. if day turns into night and you are still watching, you probably got a problem, and that was me. i didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my friends, nobody knew.\n\nthe actor added that pornography can change the way human beings view each other, not as people but as objects and body parts.\n\nmy issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. people become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, crews said. you start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.\n\nin the second clip, crews said it was important not to let a sense of shame interfere in the battle against overcoming addiction.\n\ndirty little secret part 2 posted by terry crews on wednesday, february 17, 2016\n\nshame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. and when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. you say: 'you know what, forget it, i might as well use drugs, i might as well overeat, i might as well use porn.' because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. what you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.\n\ndirty little secret part 3 posted by terry crews on tuesday, february 23, 2016\n\nin the clip posted tuesday, the actor revealed his pornography addiction became so bad he felt like my wife owed me sex.\n\nwhen you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, crews said. what entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. and self-pity — it feels good. it feels good.\n\nevery man out there desires intimacy. every time you look at pornography, it's a desire for intimacy, he said. you are trying to fight your feelings of being alone by filling it with pornography in an attempt to feel that you are with someone and you know someone. but pornography is an intimacy killer. it kills all intimacy.\n\ncrews also cautioned both men and women to take more responsibility to combat the problem.\n\nyou cannot accept any pornography in your man's life. anything that will make you feel denigrated, make you feel less than, you cannot accept it, he said.\n\ni'm calling on men to be more accountable. a true man and a true woman is a person who takes responsibility for everything in his life, good and bad, he added.\n\nwatch crews' three-part dirty little secret facebook series above.
things are about to change. don't worry: it won't last forever. these things never do. it's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… the democrat party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for democrats.\n\nunfortunately, it's going to take a while for voters to come to their senses. things are going to get worse before they get better — thankfully, this worsening will be contained in democrat-run cities.\n\nnevertheless, the radical left is now emboldened and have the democrat party, academia, the media, countless district attorney offices, the government bureaucracy, corporate america, and hollywood on the run… so until things get better (and i promise things will get better), here's my handy-dandy guide to surviving the coming era of social justice mob rule…\n\nget the hell out of democrat-run cities\n\nthis isn't an easy one to accomplish. i know because i've done it twice already. but you have to get out. the democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like antifa — these democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.\n\ni'm sorry, but the cities are lost to us now, and will be for years…\n\nwhen democrats are releasing violent criminals, encouraging illegal immigration, and passing laws to disarm you while turning the police into eunuchs, it's over… minneapolis is preparing to disband the police. los angeles just slashed police funding. new york is gearing up to slash police funding. i'm telling you, it's over…\n\nso you have to get out now, especially if you own property because that property is about to become worthless.\n\nthis is not hyperbole. this is history repeating itself. the gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.\n\nnow… if you're a democrat, you need to stay put. we don't need you voting to californicate the rest of the country.\n\nmove to rural america\n\nyou can try moving to the suburbs, i guess… but as your nearest democrat-run city descends into hell, your taxes will explode. plus, you'll be funding rotting schools, potholes, corrupt democrat political machines, and self-destructive social justice programs.\n\nalso, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. let me put it this way… if you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. graffiti is always the beginning of the end.\n\nthe reason i recommend rural america is because democrats hate rural america. they want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. rural america is red america… i love it out here. calm, peaceful, serene… not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.\n\nto those of us out here in rural america, all this mayhem is just a reality tv show we like to call toldjaso!\n\nprepare to home school\n\nif you can afford private school, great. if the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. but you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\nyou need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why america is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that global warming is real. (it's not.)\n\nbe prepared to home school.\n\nbuy guns and plenty of ammo\n\nthis is not a troll. this is not an attempt to be inflammatory. there's only one reason the left-wing terrorists in antifa and black lives matter always-always-always focused their marauding in left-wing cities: they know the populace is defenseless.\n\nthese terrorists also know that once they move out into the suburbs, people are more likely to own guns.\n\nand they damn well know rural america is armed to the teeth, so they will never come out here.\n\nfirearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. i own four firearms. two are within reach of my bed. peace of mind, baby.\n\nit's time to arm yourself.\n\ni would also recommend obtaining a conceal carry permit.\n\ncancel your cable tv\n\ncable news is poison. hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? what, you like paying $125 a month to have cnnlol deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have mtv glorify degeneracy?\n\nthere are all kinds of streaming options out there, many of them free. you'll save money, protect your kids, and best of all, push cnnlol, msnbc, and the rest one step closer to history's dustbin.\n\ni've written extensively on this. please click here, here, and here — okay, that last click is to celebrate the weekend.\n\nkeep hard copies of your favorite books, movies, and tv shows\n\nsix years ago, almost to the day, i was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of blazing saddles and gone with the wind.\n\nyou see, i've been around long enough to have learned one very important lesson about the left: no matter how outrageous the idea might sound at the time, the left — with the help of its media machine — will eventually mainstream that idea.\n\nhey, we went from zero to gay marriage in ten years. we went from zero to drag queen story hour in ten seconds.\n\nso when america's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, i knew it was only a matter of time… well, the time has come.\n\nalready, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, woody allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. the walt disney company has blacklisted its own song of the south. the creator of the simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. the library journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. the little house books are being burned.\n\nand now the blacklisting push is ramping up….\n\njust this week, the far-left washington post demanded an immediate and total shutdown of all police movies and tv shows.\n\nlegos is already blacklisting its own toys.\n\nlet me tell you exactly how this is going to work…\n\nthe fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. problematic books, movies, and tv shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.\n\nanother possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.\n\na couple of years ago, i decided to move my movie collection to digital. but after the simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, i've gotten smarter. even if i already have a digital copy, i went back and purchased hard copies of movies and tv shows that are wonderfully problematic.\n\nlet me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of manhattan (and probably all of woody allen's movies), married with children, gone with the wind, and pretty much every one of normal lear's 1970's sitcoms (all in the family, sanford & son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.\n\nsame with problematic books. amazon will remove them from your kindle.\n\nstock up on food and water\n\nthe left-wing antifa and black lives matter terrorists will probably try to attack the suburbs and rural america in an indirect way — going after power stations and the like. and if things get bad enough in the cities, we might see supply chains interrupted, so be prepared.\n\n—\n\nlisten, out here in rural america, we're going to be just fine. don't be stressed. don't live in fear — just be prepared. being prepared is a great way to relieve anxiety.\n\noverall, and as i said earlier, the left is eating its own. let them fight. enjoy the show. it's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. it's not your problem. it's not my problem.\n\nwhile blue america reaps the whirlwind, the rest of us should clean our guns, grill meat, and enjoy al bundy taunting fat women.\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
cnn's chris cuomo once again defended the left-wing terrorist group antifa, this time declaring them a good cause.\n\nthe far-left cuomo's abiding affection for these black-clad, fully masked terrorists and the violence they commit, not just against neo-nazis, but police officers, journalists, and everyday citizens, reveals a lot about the dangerous radicalism of the basement-rated cnn.\n\nlate last year cuomo openly embraced political violence against the right with a fascist rant defending antifa's brutality and bloodshed.\n\nit's not about being right in the eyes of the law, cuomo said in defense of antifa, but you also have to know what's right and wrong in a moral, in a good and evil sense.\n\nthat's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same kinds of petty violence, he added.\n\nfight.\n\nwhat you have there is a cnn anchor justifying violence against bigotry in a world where his fake news network is defining christians as bigots for opposing gay marriage, republicans as bigots for not voting for barack obama, and 16-year-old boys as bigots for wearing make america great again hats.\n\nin other words, cuomo and cnn are justifying violence against all of us, everyone to the right of bernie sanders.\n\ncuomo once compared these antifa terrorists, these modern-day brownshirts who attack police officers and regularly assault journalists, to the american servicemen who stormed the beaches at normandy.\n\nthat's a not a joke. it's right here…\n\nbut-but-but they fight bigotry, cuomo argues — which is like arguing we need to remember mussolini kept the trains running on time, hitler built the autobahn, mao fought for equality, and stalin threw good dinner parties…\n\nnow listen to cuomo attempt to justify mob violence if it's in service to a good cause.\n\nyou can talk about antifa, i've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, ok? cuomo argued. there are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.\n\ncnn's chris cuomo says antifa is a good cause pic.twitter.com/mcmgoypszq — ryan saavedra (@realsaavedra) april 30, 2019\n\nsorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from hitler to lenin to castro to pol pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. so let's use this opportunity to examine cuomo's definition of social justice.\n\nsome of you might remember that fredo's twisted idea of social justice is to expose young girls to a penis without their consent.\n\nand let's not forget that cuomo's warped idea of social justice also includes a return to mccarthyism, to a dark era where we blacklist people who express inappropriate ideas.\n\ncuomo's guest steve cortes tried reasoning with him.\n\nchris, antifa is not a good cause, he said. antifa does not have good aims, antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. that's what antifa is all about.\n\nbut cuomo already knows this. fredo's watched antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize tucker carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the southern democrats of old, he's watched antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.\n\nforget all that, though, and ask yourself on what planet does a decent person even attempt to defend a gang of thugs who dress all in black, wear masks, and brandish weapons?\n\nwell, that planet is called cnn.\n\nyou see, antifa is okay with cnn because antifa are their brownshirts, their terrorists, their violent gang of thugs taking it to we trumptards who dare to point and laugh at cnn, who dare not recognize cnn's authority and wisdom.\n\nhere's some truth: cnn thrills over the petty ultra-violence antifa unleashes against the political right. in the sick and sinister minds that run that hate network, trump supporters got it coming, which is why — and this is important…\n\ncuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.\n\nthat's what's really going on here.\n\ncuomo's not just splitting the hitler-and-the-autobahn hair to keep the debunked charlottesville hoax alive, he is using every opportunity to fire off a dogwhistle, to give his brownshirts a wink of encouragement and a nod of approval.\n\ncnn's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… much worse.\n\nall cuomo is doing here is prepping a battlefield cnn wants to see bloodied.\n\np.s. eighty-nine million who do not watch cnn are subsidizing this hate. are you one of them?\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
nasa's aircraft is roughly the size of a softball and weighs less than four pounds. it will make five autonomous flights above the surface of mars in 2021.\n\nthe miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of earth's. jpl mars helicopter project manager mimi aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the martian surface, it's already at the earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.\n\nin an official statement posted to the national aeronautics and space administration website, nasa administrator jim bridenstine said, nasa has a proud history of firsts. the idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. the mars helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to mars.\n\ntexas representative john culberson praised the effort. it's fitting that the united states of america is the first nation in history to fly the first heavier-than-air craft on another world, culberson said. this exciting and visionary achievement will inspire young people all over the united states to become scientists and engineers, paving the way for even greater discoveries in the future.\n\nthe craft will launch onboard the united launch alliance's atlas v rocket from cape canaveral air force station in florida in july 2020 and is expected to arrive on mars in february 2021. because of its immense distance — earth will be several minutes away, traveling at the speed of light — aung said that direct control will be impossible. instead, the craft will have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own.\n\nnasa science mission directorate associate administrator thomas zurbuchen said that the project exemplifies a successful marriage of science and technology innovation and is a unique opportunity to advance mars exploration for the future.\n\nafter the wright brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on earth, he said, another group of american pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world.

cardinal gerhard ludwig müller, the vatican's former doctrinal czar, warned against catholics who long for a meta-religion of world unity in a january 1 homily in phoenix.\n\nsome catholics want the church to modernize, abandoning its doctrines for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, müller warned thousands of catholics gathered in phoenix for the 2020 student leadership summit hosted by the fellowship of catholic university students (focus).\n\nin order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students. no big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.\n\nthe post-christian world welcomes these efforts to remake the church as a convenient civil religion, müller said.\n\nthe german cardinal tied his remarks to claims by the late jesuit cardinal carlo maria martini that the church was 200 years behind the times and needed to modernize in order to catch up.\n\nfor some, the catholic church is lagging behind by 200 years compared to where the world is today. is there any truth to this accusation? müller asked the group.\n\nit is surely no coincidence that pope francis had cited this same quotation in a positive sense just days before christmas in an address to the roman curia, calling for epochal change while insisting that resistance to change always hides some mental disorder.\n\nthe church has remained 200 years behind the times. why has it not been shaken up? are we scared? fear instead of courage? pope francis cited martini to the curia, adding that these are words that should make us think.\n\nthere is always a temptation to fall back on the past, francis continued in his dec. 21 address, because it is more reassuring, known and, certainly less conflictual. yet this too is part of the process and the risk of undertaking significant changes.\n\nit would not be unreasonable to suggest that cardinal müller's homily wednesday was in fact a response to the pope's call for modernization.\n\naccording to müller, the crisis facing the catholic church today has arisen from attempts to align with secular culture while abandoning the teachings of the faith in the process.\n\nthe crisis in the church is man-made and has arisen because we have cozily adapted ourselves to the spirit of a life without god, the cardinal said.\n\nthe poison paralyzing the church is the opinion that we should adapt to the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not the spirit of god, he said, that we should relativize god's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.\n\nsome people in the church are longing for a catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium, müller proposed.\n\nin his homily, müller told the students that the antidote to secularization within the church is a life of faith, since people of faith do not crave the gratifications that the world offers.\n\nthe one who believes needs no ideology, he said. the one who hopes will not reach for drugs. the one who loves is not after the lust of this world, which passes along with the world. the one who loves god and his neighbor finds happiness in the sacrifice of self-giving.\n\nwe will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which god has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.\n\nfollow @tdwilliamsrome
for the first time in more than 130 years of record-keeping, young adults in the united states are more likely living with mom and dad than they are living with a spouse or partner.\n\nthirty-two percent of millennials adults aged 18-34 were living in their parents' home in 2014, compared to 31.6 percent of millennials who live with a spouse or significant other, according to a new pew research center analysis of government data.\n\nanother 14 percent of millennials live alone, or else are single parents. twenty-two percent live in other circumstances.\n\nthis turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35, pew's analysis reads.\n\ndating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other, it continues. this type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation's 18- to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.\n\nas pew reports, the trend is most prevalent among young men, with 35 percent of male millennials opting for the comforts of mom and dad's home, compared to 28 percent who were living with a spouse or partner in their own place.\n\nyoung women, on the other hand, are actually more likely to be living with a spouse (35 percent) than their parents (29 percent).\n\nmarriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry. in addition to the decline in marriage, pew also cites the economy as a central fact causing the adults' retreat to mom and dad's house — simply put, fewer young men have decent jobs.\n\nthe share of young men with jobs peaked around 1960 at 84%. in 2014, only 71% of 18 to 34-year-old men were employed, pew reports. similarly with earnings, young men's wages (after adjusting for inflation) have been on a downward trajectory since 1970 and fell significantly from 2000 to 2010. as wages have fallen, the share of young men living in the home of their parent(s) has risen.\n\nthe phenomena also varies among racial and ethnic groups. black (36 percent) and hispanic (36 percent) young adults are more likely to live at home than are white (30 percent) young adults.\n\nwhite young adults are more likely to be living with a spouse or partner (36%), the report reads. but the trends are similar for all major racial and ethnic groups including whites: since 1960, a greater share are living at home and fewer are married or [are] cohabiting and living in their own household.

the vatican has announced in a statement this week that pope paul vi will be canonized in rome next october with salvadoran archbishop oscar romero, who was killed in 1980 while celebrating mass.\n\npaul vi was pope from 1963 to 1978 and oversaw the close of the second vatican council, which introduced sweeping changes in the church, including the introduction of the use of local languages in the liturgy and a rapprochement between catholics and other religions, notably the jews.\n\nthe pope's most controversial move during his tumultuous, 15-year pontificate was the publication of the 1968 encyclical letter titled humanae vitae (on human life), which confirmed the church's longstanding teaching regarding the immorality of the use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. many inside and outside the church had expected paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission paul had set up to study the question.\n\nas paul himself noted:\n\nwithin the commission itself, there was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed, and … certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this question had emerged which were at variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the church.\n\npope francis has significantly chosen the year 2018—the fiftieth anniversary of humanae vitae—for the canonization of pope paul vi. francis has often voiced his personal esteem for paul vi and has held up humanae vitae as a critically important document for today's world.\n\nin his 2016 letter, amoris laetitia (the joy of love), francis cited humanae vitae four times, praising the way that paul had brought out the intrinsic bond between conjugal love and the generation of life.\n\nthe teaching of the encyclical humanae vitae ought to be taken up anew, francis wrote, in order to counter a mentality that is often hostile to life.\n\npope john paul ii spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying humanae vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body. as michael waldstein has written, one of the main goals of the theology of the body is the defense of paul vi's prophetic encyclical humanae vitae.\n\nten years ago, in a conference commemorating humanae vitae's 40th anniversary, pope benedict xvi referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of paul vi a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the church's doctrine and tradition.\n\nvatican secretary of state cardinal pietro parolin reportedly said tuesday that the canonization ceremony of paul vi and oscar romero will take place in late october following a meeting of the synod of bishops.\n\npope francis beatified paul vi in 2014 after a first miracle was attributed to his intercession. in early february, a vatican commission consisting of theologians and doctors approved a second miracle attributed to him by a unanimous vote.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
president obama's statement on gun control tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd amendment:\n\nnow, i want to be absolutely clear at the start — and i've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that i have to do — i believe in the second amendment. it's there written on the paper. it guarantees a right to bear arms. no matter how many times people try to twist my words around — i taught constitutional law, i know a little about this — i get it. but i also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the second amendment.\n\nnot a very convincing performance. is there any other amendment to the constitution the president would downplay in this way? saying, it's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th amendment.\n\nif the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. president obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.\n\n1.) here's the president swearing repeatedly, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\n\nas it turns out, that was not true. in fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. when the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. in november 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. as you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.\n\na month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. it was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.\n\n2.) it wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about obamacare. he also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.\n\nunfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in congress and the media were as disciplined. a number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. the president tried to fool the american people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. he almost got away with it.\n\n3.) before he became president, obama told pastor rick warren, i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjhqbz1la0w\n\nhard to be more clear than that. obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. and then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. but had he really? according to chief strategist david axelrod, obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:\n\naxelrod writes that he knew obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. axelrod also admits to counseling obama to conceal that position for political reasons. opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' axelrod writes.\n\nobama reportedly told axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, i'm just not very good at bullshitting. based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
a gay guidance counselor suspended from a catholic high school is pushing to change the policy of the archdiocese of indianapolis that bans employees who are in same-sex marriages – even though she signed a contract stating she understood the expectations of employees of the catholic archdiocese.\n\nshelly fitzgerald said she was suspended from her job as a guidance counselor at roncalli high school, a catholic school that is overseen by the archdiocese of indianapolis, indiana, after it was discovered she had married another woman.\n\na report at abc affiliate rtv6 stated fitzgerald posted to her facebook account:\n\nsomeone sought out my marriage certificate from hancock county and turned it into joe hollowell (the school's chief administrator). he then turned it over to the archbishop of indianapolis, the superintendent and chuck weisenbach [roncalli school principal].\n\nthe report continues that fitzgerald, who had been employed at the school for 15 years, says she met with the school's administrator and principal and was given the options of resigning, dissolving her marriage, or wait it out and stay quiet and maybe i can make it the rest of the year, but they will not renew my contract next year.\n\ni love my wife very much, fitzgerald said. i didn't have any intention to resign a job that i adore. for me to walk out was like saying i didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.\n\nindiana state rep. dan forestal, a democrat, said he will intervene in the case by trying to block schools whose religious beliefs oppose same-sex marriage from receiving taxpayer voucher funds.\n\naccording to the report:\n\nroncalli is a private school but they also receive state funding through indiana's school choice voucher program. an annual report from the indiana department of education shows that the school received more than $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars last year.\n\nroncalli should not be rewarded with state dollars if they choose to discriminate against employees simply based on who they love, forestal said.\n\nas fox59 reported, fitzgerald has hired an attorney, david page, who refused to give details about his client's signed contract due to the possibility of future litigation.\n\nin a statement, the catholic school has said as role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor, administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the catholic church, the report continued.\n\npage said his client was barred from the campus and her school email account.\n\n[s]he was heartbroken and stunned, page said. stunned is the word she uses most often.\n\nthe attorney added that everyone at the school knew she was gay.\n\nfitzgerald has received an outpouring of support via an online petition signed by over 15,000 supporters.\n\nthe petition states:\n\nafter a nosey member of the community found out shelly fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. for 15 years, shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at roncalli high school (rhs), a catholic high school in indiana. and when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. they gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. and she plans to hire a lawyer. but should she have to? the school says they have every right to force shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the catholic church both in and out of school. that includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\none roncalli board member, daniel parker, resigned from his post in support of fitzgerald because she has been his child's guidance counselor.\n\nclearly, we are doing something right when our young students and graduates understand better than some older adults that love is love, commitment is commitment, and marriage is marriage no matter who opens their heart to those wonderful gifts from god, parker said.\n\nroncalli high school is named for cardinal angelo roncalli, who became pope john xxiii and, since his canonization, is now referred to as saint john xxiii.
a muslim from sunderland who started a polygamy matchmaking website for men seeking multiple sharia marriages says that monogamy is not in tune with man's nature and believes he has already been responsible for 100 'weddings'.\n\nazad chaiwala, 33, who launched secondwife.com in 2014 followed by polygamy.com this year, claims that both sites have 70,000 members looking for polygamous marriages.\n\nunapologetic about his own desire for multiple wives, he told his own wife early on in their marriage, which was arranged by his family, that she would not be the only one.\n\nhowever, in seeking a second wife mr. chaiwala admitted that none of his family wanted to help saying there was a taboo about the subject, reports the times.\n\nnoting that there were dating sites catering to every niche, desire, and fetish, he said: i think polygamy is more in tune with [man's] nature than monogamy.\n\nchaiwala's sharia marriage websites were directly cited in the review on social integration by cohesion advisor dame louise casey on how foreign cultural practices contrary to british values are being tolerated. the report largely blames the tolerance of regressive cultures for segregation and said that pressure should be put on migrants to integrate.\n\nthe practice of unregistered polygamy appears to be more commonplace than might be expected, dame louise said. the existence of matchmaking sites like secondwife.com and the prevalence of unregistered marriage is particularly concerning.\n\nher report said that there were approximately 100,000 sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by uk law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. a sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).\n\nbaroness cox, a cross-bench member of the house of lords, said in october that polygamy is commonplace within muslim communities in britain, with husbands fathering as many as 20 children by four wives.\n\nshe explained: under sharia law, a husband is entitled to up to four wives providing he takes responsibility for making appropriate provision for all. in many muslim communities in this country, polygamy is commonplace although as a nation bigamy is legally forbidden.\n\nwitnesses to the commons home affairs committee, as part of the broader inquiry into sharia councils, have warned that the number of polygynous marriages is on the rise.\n\nthey point out that whilst polygamy is illegal, there is no requirement for a civil, legal, ceremony to precede a sharia marriage. this means that imams are under no obligation to refuse to perform a marriage because the man is already married.\n\naina khan, a leading family lawyer specialising in islamic marriages, said that the marriage act was out of date.\n\nit dates back to 1949 and only anglicans, jews and quakers must register their religious ceremony with the register office . . . now nearly three million muslims, with origins from many countries, live here.\n\nnoting that having more than one wife was an outward sign of religiosity, ms. khan said that of the couples who came to her seeking to separate, a quarter involved polygynous issues.\n\nit is not a recipe for a happy marriage. they do not last, she said.\n\nin 2015 amra bone, who was the uk's first female sharia council judge, said that the government cannot…ask muslims not to have more than one wife. people have a right to decide for themselves.
a coalition of anti-racist, gay rights and student groups are preparing to sue facebook, twitter and youtube for allegedly hosting hate speech but continuing to censor pornographic content.\n\nfrance's largest anti-racism group, sos racism, the jewish students' union (uejf), and a group called sos homophobie have released the results of a social media survey carried out between the 31st of march and the 10th of may.\n\nit claimed to find 586 examples of content that is racist, anti-semitic or homophobic, denies the holocaust or seeks to justify terrorism or crimes against humanity. they insist this is in breach of the law in france, which has sweeping protections against hate speech.\n\naccording to humanité, the report went on to say that of the 586 reported cases of alleged hate material, only four per cent were removed from twitter, seven per cent from youtube, and 34 per cent from facebook.\n\nthe term hate speech is notably broad and open to wide interpretation. it has been appropriated to cover anything from mild criticism of islam, gay marriage and mass migration, to neo-nazi and islamist propaganda.\n\nif the french groups win their case, it could result in even more conservative material disappearing from the accused social media platforms.\n\nsacha reingewirtz, president of uejf, slammed the tech firms for not removing perceived offensive content or revealing how they choose stories to occupy their trending news section.\n\ngiven the profits youtube, twitter and facebook make in france, and the few taxes they pay, their refusal to invest in the fight against hatred is unacceptable, she said.\n\nshe added: the mystery surrounding the functioning of the moderation teams of social networks prevents any serious progress in reducing racist and anti-semitic messages. since the major platforms do not respect french law, not even their own conditions, they will have to face justice.\n\ndominique sopo, president of sos racisme, argued that female breasts should be splashed across social media, saying:\n\ntwitter, youtube and facebook cannot continue to use soothing words to cover their inaction on moderation.\n\nthese platforms seem more shocked by toplessness, which is promptly censored, than the incitement to hatred against persons or groups of persons. our lawsuit against them is to enforce a right that they must now fully comply with.\n\ngilles dehais president of sos homophobia, said: despite an effort to address hate speech when it is reported, this testing campaign shows the lack of responsiveness to flagged content via the current route.\n\nwe regret that the majority of internet players still do not implement sufficient means to protect their users from homophobic, biphobic and transphobic sentiments, and enforce french law.
thirty-year-old millennials' fortunes, sex lives, and income are all pitiful compared to what their fathers enjoyed at age 30, according to axios.\n\nmillennial men pay 2.5 times as much for college, have triple the debt, have half the chance of being married, fewer kids, and are much less likely to own a home, according to the data presented by axios.\n\nover the last 4 decades, young americans have paid more for education even as their incomes have stayed flat. the result? way more debt, and fewer adult rites of passage like marriage and homeownership. explore the numbers: https://t.co/afhxddtbim via @axiosvisuals @axios pic.twitter.com/ecf3fq60qv — harry stevens (@harry_stevens) july 23, 2018\n\naxios reported that compared to 30 years ago:\n\nmen are more likely to earn less. in 1975, only a quarter of 25 to 34-year-old men made less than $30k per year, but that number rose to 41% in 2016. going deeper: as a measure of upward mobility, 92% of 30-year-olds in 1970 earned more than their parents at that age, according to a 2016 study led by raj chetty, a stanford economist (h/t roger lowenstein). but of those who were 30 in 2014, just half earned more. [economist raj] chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower gdp growth and a change in the distribution of gdp favoring higher earners: gdp would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.\n\nmillennial women are individually better off than their mothers — but the women's husbands are the millennial men.\n\nmissing from axios, however, is any mention of the causes, such as the federal government's immigration policy of importing one new worker for every four americans who graduate school or college each year.\n\nthis massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. the new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young american college graduates struggle to pay off debts.\n\npresident donald trump's hire american campaign would modestly curb the inflow of immigrants and foreign workers, but it is strongly opposed by progressives, democrats and business-first republicans.\n\nfour million americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market — but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.\n\nthe washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. that process spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. the policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
a new study shows there's much more depression, obesity and suicidal tendencies among adults raised by same-sex couples than among adults raised by a normal family of complementary male and female parents.\n\naccording to the study, which tracks the development of children to adulthood, 51 percent of those raised by same-sex couples had experienced depression, compared to only 19.7 percent of those raised in normal married households.\n\nby age 28 a cohort of children raised by same-sex parents are 2.25 times more likely to experience depression than is the general population. adult onset depression is associated with a more frequent history of abuse victimization, obesity, stigma, and distance from one or both parents.\n\nthirty percent of adults from gay households fanaticized about suicide as an adult, compared to 7 percent from normal households. a whopping 71.9 percent of adults raised in gay homes reported obesity, compared to 37 percent from opposite-sex homes.\n\nthe study shows more kids raised by gays reported that a parent or caregiver had slapped, hit, or kicked them. more of them said they were touched in a sexual way or forced to touch someone in a sexual way or were forced into sex relations.\n\nthe study flies in the face of recent claims by gay advocates that there is no difference between being raised by gays or by straights.\n\nthe study used data from the non-partisan national longitudinal study of adolescent health, and was produced by professor paul sullins of the leo initiative. he's worked with the department of sociology at the catholic university of america for many years.\n\nthe major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. but there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period. even so, as sociologist mark regnerus says of this study, this makes the same-sex household estimates displayed in the graph imprecise, but it does nothing to undermine the significance of the differences between groups.\n\nthe study has already come under attack from gay blogs that tend to pounce on any negative data.\n\nat the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, regnerus of the university of texas at austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as sullins has reached. though the university of texas backed him up and the journal that published his paper has not withdrawn it, he still comes under bitter criticism from gay advocates.\n\nthinkprogress has tried to smear sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. the author, zack ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of sullins in his priestly garb. he also complained that the study was carried out on children raised by gays prior to the legalization of gay marriage, proposing that marriage will make all the difference in outcomes for kids.\n\neven liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. secular sociologist sara mclanahan of princeton university and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families.
conservative david benham was arrested outside of a clinic in north carolina over the weekend for allegedly violating the state and federal coronavirus rules. prior to the outbreak, it was legal for pro-life advocates to gather at a certain distance outside of abortion clinics to offer women alternatives to ending the life of their unborn child.\n\ndavid and his twin brother, jason, gained fame as successful businessmen who were offered a show on the home and garden tv channel but were abruptly fired after their christian worldview was revealed, including their support for traditional marriage between a man and a woman and respecting life from conception to natural death.\n\ndavid benham posted a video of his interaction with police on the brothers' facebook page.\n\nthat abortion clinic exceeds the number of ten, david benham said, referring to the federal government guidance that no groups larger than ten people should gather in one place.\n\ndavid benham told the police arresting him that he and the others outside of the clinic were there with a group that helps at-risk mothers and babies.\n\nwe are within our rights to be here, david benham said. we are practicing social distancing. we have cleaned our hands, and we are offering help to these mothers.\n\nand if you are saying we don't have the right to be here then go in the abortion clinic and make the arrests there, benham said to an officer, who said he did not have the authority to go inside the clinic.\n\ni appreciate your serving, david benham said. i appreciate everything that you do for us, but this is wrong and you know it.\n\nthe christian post reported on david benham speaking with the daily wire about his arrest:\n\nspeaking to the daily wire, benham said, this is selective enforcement of the law. you are coming after us because we're standing in front of an abortion clinic … i am not going to let the government have unlimited power and use this crisis to their advantage. benham says his federally recognized public charity, cities for life, is considered an essential service. however, police officers claimed that more than 10 people had gathered, an accusation that benham denied.\n\nsen. ted cruz (r-tx) offered his friend support on social media, calling the arrest unconstitutional.\n\nmy friend david benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in nc for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic, cruz tweeted. if nc deems abortion 'essential,' then pregnancy care services are as well. this is wrong; governor cooper should be ashamed.\n\nwatch: my friend david benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in nc for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic. if nc deems abortion essential, then pregnancy care services are as well. this is wrong; governor cooper should be ashamed. 1/x https://t.co/eingjox2ur — ted cruz (@tedcruz) april 4, 2020\n\nthe day after his arrest, david benham tweeted about how north carolina police seem to be selectively enforcing the coronavirus rules.\n\nthere is clear bias against law-abiding #prolife christians. parks are full in our city on sat/sun…no crowds broken up, but when i stand by myself at an abortion clinic i get arrested #viewpointdiscrimination, he tweeted.\n\nthere is clear bias against law-abiding #prolife christians. parks are full in our city on sat/sun…no crowds broken up, but when i stand by myself at an abortion clinic i get arrested #viewpointdiscrimination https://t.co/1gfsozoljh — david benham (@daviddbenham) april 6, 2020\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter.

wednesday on fox news channel's tucker carlson tonight, host tucker carlson opened the program by reacting to sen-elect mitt romney's (r-ut) public critique of president donald trump.\n\ncarlson reminded viewers of romney's path to prosperity at bain capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real americans. carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of trump.\n\ntranscript as follows:\n\ngood evening and welcome to tucker carlson tonight. happy new year. newly-elected utah senator mitt romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the washington post savaging donald trump's character and leadership. romney's attack and trump's response this morning on twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. it's even possible that romney is planning to challenge trump for the republican nomination in 2020. we'll see. but for now, romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. it's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nromney's main complaint is that donald trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. that's true of course. beneath the personal slights, though, romney has a policy critique. he seems genuinely angry that trump might pull american troops out of the syrian civil war. romney doesn't explain how staying in syria would benefit america. he doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. more policing in the middle east is always better. we know that. virtually everyone in washington agrees.\n\ncorporate tax cuts are also popular in washington, and romney is strongly on board with those too. his piece throws throws a rare compliment to trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. this isn't surprising. romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called bain capital. bain capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. romney became fantastically rich doing this. meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. this is the private equity model. our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. it's how they run the country.\n\nmitt romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream republican view. he's right. for generations, republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. modern democrats generally support these goals. there are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in america. in countries around the world — france, brazil, sweden, the philippines, germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. these are not isolated events. what you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nsomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. donald trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the white house. does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying america? those are open questions. but they're less relevant than we think. at some point, donald trump will be gone. the rest of us will be too. the country will remain. what kind of country will be it be then? how do we want our grandchildren to live?\n\nthese are the only questions that matter. the answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for america is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. but is that still true? does anyone still believe that cheaper iphones, or more amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from china are going to make us happy? they haven't so far. a lot of americans are drowning in stuff. yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in gdp is an idiot.\n\nthe goal for america is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. it's happiness. there are a lot of ingredients in being happy: dignity. purpose. self-control. independence. above all, deep relationships with other people. those are the things that you want for your children. they're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. but our leaders don't care. we are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. they're day traders. substitute teachers. they're just passing through. they have no skin in this game, and it shows. they can't solve our problems. they don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\none of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. economics is a topic for public debate. family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. both parties believe this. members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the democratic party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. in other words, functionally libertarian. they don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. as far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\nsocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. the real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the american family is collapsing. nothing can be fixed before we fix that. yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. the idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. they refuse to consider it. questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nboth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. certain economic systems allow families to thrive. thriving families make market economies possible. you can't separate the two. it used to be possible to deny this. not anymore. the evidence is now overwhelming. consider the inner cities. thirty years ago, conservatives looked at detroit or newark and were horrified by what they saw. conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. the majority of children were born out of wedlock. single mothers were the rule. crime and drugs and disorder became universal. what caused this nightmare? liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. they were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nthere was truth in what the conservatives said. but it wasn't the whole story. how do we know? because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. in many ways, rural america now looks a lot like detroit. this is striking because rural americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. these groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. usually they have different skin colors. rural people are white conservatives, mostly. yet the pathologies of modern rural america are familiar to anyone who visited downtown baltimore in the 1980s: stunning out of wedlock birthrates. high male unemployment. a terrifying drug epidemic.\n\ntwo different worlds. similar outcomes. how did this happen? you'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. mostly they're not. they don't have to be. it's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born americans who are slipping behind. but republicans now represent rural voters. they ought to be interested. here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. all that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. in many places, women suddenly made more than men. before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. maybe they should want to, but they don't. over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. this isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. it's social science. we know it's true. rich people know it best of all. that's why they get married before they have kids. that model works. increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford.\n\nand yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. rich people are happy to fight malaria in congo. but working to raise men's wages in dayton or detroit? that's crazy.\n\nthis is negligence on a massive scale. both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem american families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or facebook executives.\n\nfor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. they teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. sheryl sandburg of facebook wrote an entire book about this. sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. no surprise there. sandburg herself is one of america's biggest shareholders. propaganda like this has made her rich. what's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. we didn't question why sandburg was saying this. we didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. our corporate media celebrated sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. her book became a bestseller: lean in. as if putting a corporation first is empowerment. it's not. it's bondage. republicans should say so.\n\nthey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. not all commerce is good. why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? or charge them interest that impoverishes them? payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. we're ok with that? we shouldn't be. libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. ok. but it's also disgusting. if you care about america, you ought to oppose the exploitation of americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on wall street.\n\nand by the way, if you really loved your fellow americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. which they are. a huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. you may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. but it's everywhere. that's not an accident. once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. in many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. former speaker of the house john boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. his fellow republicans seem fine with that. oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. maybe. who cares? talk about missing the point. try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. the life is gone. passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. do you want that for your kids? of course not. then why are our leaders pushing it on us? you know the reason. because they don't care about you.\n\nwhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. our leaders don't even try. they hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. there's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. under our current system, an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. we tax capital at half of what we tax labor. it's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating. our leaders rarely mention any of this. they tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. please. it's based on laws that congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. it worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. unfairness is profoundly divisive. when you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. they hate each other. that happens in countries too. it's happening in ours, probably by design. divided countries are easier to rule. nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. in our country, some people definitely are. republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\nwhat kind of country do you want to live in? a fair country. a decent country. a cohesive country. a country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. a country you might recognize when you're old. a country that listens to young people who don't live in brooklyn. a country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. a country where lewiston, maine seems almost as important as the west side of los angeles. a country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. a clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. and above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. a country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\nwhat will it take a get a country like that? leaders who want it. for now, those leaders will have to be republicans. there's no option at this point. but first, republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. you'd have to be a fool to worship it. our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. we do not exist to serve markets. just the opposite. any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. a system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\ninternalizing this won't be easy for republican leaders. they'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. they'll likely lose donors in the process. libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. that's a lie. socialism is a disaster. it doesn't work. it's what we should be working desperately to avoid. but socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the american economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\nif you want to put america first, you've got to put its families first.
on tuesday, manny pacquiao, fighter of the decade for the 2000s according to the boxing writers association of america and ring magazine, apologized for remarks in which he called homosexuality something that even animals don't try.\n\npacquiao refused to retract his opposition to gay marriage.\n\npacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the tv5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. he asserted, it's just common sense. have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.\n\npacquiao's comments sparked outrage, as tv host jose marie viceral, tweeted that lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people are humans, not animals. danton remoto, chairman of the lgbt group ladlad, pointing out pacquiao's position in the philippines house of representatives and his current campaign for a senate seat, echoed, he is running for a national position and he should be a senator of everybody, not just over-the-hill boxers and straight people. he said that pacquiao and his advisers should adhere to current political correctness, sniping, otherwise, they would be left behind in the dark ages, when the cavemen ruled and the numbskulls roamed the earth,.\n\nlesbian singer aiza seguerra ripped pacquiao on instagram: you might've done our country proud but with your statement, you just showed the whole country why we shouldn't vote for you. and yes, i think you are an ignorant, bigoted hypocrite.\n\npacquiao backed down on a facebook video, stating: i'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. please forgive me for those i've hurt. but in an instagram post, he simply stated:\n\ni rather obey the lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. im not condemning anyone, but i'm just telling the truth of what the bible says. the truth from the bible is what changed me from my old ways. 1 corinthians 6:9 [9] or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god? do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men. god bless everyone i love you all.\n\nin 2012, the los angeles shopping center the grove banned pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in the national examiner wrongly attributed remarks to pacquiao. the 57-6-2 fighter later told the los angeles times, what i said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … i am against gay marriage, but i'm not condemning gays. i have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. i'm just against gay marriage. i don't even want to talk about the issue, but i was asked about it, so i gave my opinion.\n\npacquiao plans to retire from boxing after his rubber match with timothy bradley on april 9.
with the russia collusion hoax debunked forever, the corrupt establishment media are now in a mad scramble to manufacture a different kind of anxiety against president trump, this time using multiple artificial hysterias.\n\nhonestly, any rational person who lives in the real world — and i like to count myself among that group — must be baffled by the news media's ongoing meltdown; the screech of one crisis after another, which reflects nothing close to reality.\n\nfor example: yesterday, i paid 98 cents for a dozen eggs. my 401(k) is kicking butt. no one i know is struggling to find work, which was definitely not the case a few years ago. american servicemen are not coming home in body bags. there are no race riots, which also wasn't the case a few years ago. there seems to be fewer domestic terror attacks. for the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.\n\nunemployment has reached record lows. wages are rising. manufacturing jobs are coming back. inflation is almost non-existent…\n\nthis, my friends, is what peace and prosperity look and feel like. this is it. take it from a middle-aged guy who lived through watergate, vietnam, the carter years, 9/11, iraq, and barry obama's managed decline — this is as good as america gets.\n\nbut with a republican in office, most especially a republican named donald trump, the media are desperate to distract us from this inconvenient good news, and so they are manufacturing a fabricated reality where mississippi is still burning, white supremacism is on the march, the chinese are about to red dawn our economy, everyone's going to be shot at school, democracy itself teeters on the brink, and women are about to be forced back into the kitchen.\n\nhere's a quick round up of the latest nonsense our corrupt media are hoaxing the country with.\n\ntrump's tariff war with china is going to kill the economy\n\nthis, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. to begin with, none of the tariffs trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. in fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.\n\nhow many times can the media turn a single day stock market drop into a financial crisis before we all roll our eyes and turn the channel?\n\ni find this hysteria tedious.\n\nglobal warming will kill you\n\ni guess it's a good thing alexandria ocasio-crazy is backing off her claim we will all die in 12 years, but she's still assuring us global warming is a real threat that will kill us, but you'll have to pardon me if i don't take my climate advice from a 29-year-old who freaks out over her first look at a garbage disposal.\n\nit's may 15, i live in the south, and when i woke up this morning it was 36 degrees. there was even a little frost on the ground.\n\nthe planet appears to be doing just fine, much better than the eternally neurotic ocasio-crazy.\n\nschool shooting epidemic\n\nto gin up this lie, media outlets, most especially cnn, are spreading provably false statistics — lies easily debunked by anyone who can google.\n\nthe truth is that when it comes to these terrible shootings, our schools are much safer than they were 20 years ago.\n\ntrump's 'constitutional crisis'\n\nin a woefully transparent act of collusion between democrats and the establishment media, the media repeated the phrase constitutional crisis 386 times between may 8 and 12.\n\na perfect example courtesy of newsbusters: on friday, cnn's erin burnett asked indignantly: if this is a constitutional crisis, how can democrats not move forward with impeachment hearings?\n\nmuch of this hysteria is based on the trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser democrats can come up with a russia collusion hoax do-over — you know, because special counsel robert mueller and his gang of partisan democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.\n\nthe executive branch has been fighting the legislative branch over this stuff since the creation of our government and nothing is a constitutional crisis until the executive branch defies a supreme court order, or the equivalent of one, to cooperate with congress. .\n\nsorry, that's just a fact.\n\nwe cannot be in a constitutional crisis when the executive branch is 1) complying with court orders and 2) using constitutional means to tell congress to shove it.\n\nactually, this is the opposite of a constitutional crisis; this is the constitution at its best: the war is political and legal as opposed to physical.\n\ngod bless america.\n\nwhite supremacism epidemic\n\nhand-picked experts are telling the conspiracy theorists at cnn that white supremacism is on the rise and a contagion and must be labeled as terrorism so it can be treated like isis.\n\nyeah, there's a good idea: treat our own citizens like foreign terrorists.\n\nfirst off, the so-called boost in hate crimes is a hoax based solely on the fact that more agencies have been added to those reporting hate crimes.\n\nsecondly, if white supremacism was a real problem in america, cnn and the rest of the media would not be forced to manufacture one hate crime after another: remember hands up, don't shoot; george zimmerman the white hispanic; the kkkids from kkkovington high school; jussie smollett? all hoaxes.\n\nin fact, most hate crimes end up being debunked as hoaxes.\n\nriddle me this: how much white supremacism can there be in america when the long-dead kate smith has to be disinterred for a two minute hate? good grief, there is so little racism in america, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. and even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. kate smith was no racist.\n\ni've lived in the south for nearly 20 years and my interracial marriage has never brought my wife and i so much as a double take.\n\nthe return of back alley abortions\n\nthank god states like alabama are aggressively looking to put an end to the holocaust of abortion. regardless, the worst case scenario for the pro-infanticide crowd is that the supreme court overturns roe v. wade, and as unlikely as that is to happen, it would still not outlaw the killing of the unborn for convenience purposes.\n\noverturning roe v. wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. with all the government money they receive, i'm sure planned parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.\n\nto be fair, though, alyssa milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.\n\nfox news is the devil\n\nin an ocean of leftist news outlets fox news is a lonely buoy that offers some right-of-center opinion. sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) (aka indian princess lies-like-a-rug) is only the latest example of the hate poured all over fox, but according to cnn and other media outlets, fox is a disease helping to spread all six of the phony crises listed above.\n\nthis is how intolerant the left and media are — they don't even want one buoy in their ocean of lies.\n\n—\n\nseriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. so unless you live in a city like baltimore, chicago, or san francisco — a city exclusively run by democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… life is good in trump's america, about as good as it gets… and all of this hysterical bs, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.\n\nthe media cannot defeat trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
an offshoot of the chinese communist youth league published a video featuring chinese celebrities promoting the nation's totalitarian social credit system to young people, urging them to give thumbs up to integrity, australia's abc news reported on wednesday.\n\nthe music video, titled, live up to your word, features a variety of chinese actors and musicians who cater to young audiences, including 24-year-old actor xu weizhou, popular boy band member wang yuan, and romantic comedy star wei daxun.\n\nbeginning with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of early 2000s american punk-pop, the video features its stars in various public settings encouraging the listener to participate in communist society as the party decrees, whether at school, in the workplace, or playing sports. the stars lead business meetings, study in libraries, and grocery shop, the implicit message of the video being that only by obeying the party can a young person have access to the necessary resources to participate in society.\n\naccording to abc news' translation, the lyrics urge the viewer to be a trustworthy youth.\n\nlet's give the thumbs up to integrity, and unite in building credit china together, the video suggests. live every day carefully.\n\nalthough the lyrics don't specifically mention the social credit system (scs), actors and singers are seen demonstrating how to be a trustworthy citizen in a range of scenarios such as shopping at an unmanned store, renting a shared bike, reading at a public library, and finalising a business deal, the abc report notes.\n\nthe video is reportedly a production of china youth credit action, a campaign to promote the social credit system supervised by the communist youth league. the youth league is responsible for recruiting young communists, ensuring that young people do not deviate away from communist values, and controlling nearly every aspect of the lives of its members. the group has worked to promote banning participation in western festivities such as christmas, and launched a dating service in 2017 to promote marriage and reproduction among communists (and, presumably, to keep communists from falling in love with unauthorized persons who may hold alternative points of view).\n\nthe social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. the number is based on both loyalty to the party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. the consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.\n\nthe system will not fully go into place until 2020, so the government has begun publishing promotional material for it now. it is currently partially operational, however, and blocked chinese citizens from buying 23 million airplane and train tickets as of march 2019.\n\non thursday, the chinese state-run global times newspaper reported that the communist party is considering adding unpaid parking tickets to the metric that determines a person's credit score. the article discusses traditional financial credit scores but states that the people's bank of china (pbc) is working to integrate its credit system into a government-controlled personal credit score. it quotes a chinese professor promoting the use of all human behavior to determine a financial credit score.\n\ndong dengxin, director of the financial securities institute at the wuhan university of science and technology, told the global times on wednesday that it is important to establish a comprehensive credit system, rather than a one-sided database that only focuses on financial activities, in order to regulate social behavior, the newspaper reports, noting that dong believes this system is not possible without having strict privacy protection in place so that only the repressive communist party has access to the information.\n\nthe global times also ran a column wednesday by a senior pbc official urging the establishment of a credit score for local governments, so that the national communist party can keep them under tight control.\n\ngovernment credibility is an important part of establishing a social credit system, which should supervise government activities and debt risks, the article argued.\n\nfollow frances martel on facebook and twitter.
dr. manny sethi, a candidate for the gop nomination for u.s. senate in tennessee, decided to surround himself with never trumpers, including his campaign manager who believes president donald trump is a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.\n\nsethi has presented himself as a conservative outsider in the race against the trump-backed bill hagerty, but all the people he has brought into every senior role in his campaign are devout never trump political consultants.\n\nhis campaign manager forrest barnwell-hagemeyer, for instance, is a former staffer to former ohio gov. john kasich—a never trumper expected to endorse 2020 presumptive democrat presidential nominee joe biden. kasich is so far in for biden that he is expected to abandon the republican party altogether to speak at the democrat national convention (dnc), or whatever semblance of a dnc there is, to try to oust trump. on his facebook page, barnwell-hagemeyer still has a photograph of him wearing a kasich shirt from april 5, 2016, when the former ohio governor was trying to stop trump from winning the gop nomination.\n\na couple weeks before that kasich shirt photo, barnwell-hagemeyer in a now-deleted march 23, 2016, facebook post, attacked then-candidate trump while hyping a speech then-house speaker paul ryan made attempting to distance republicans from the man who would become president.\n\nif you haven't watched speaker ryan's remarks yet, i highly recommend it, barnwell-hagemeyer wrote. this is what conservatism is about, this is what the republican party stands for, and these are the ideas we must fight for.\n\nin the next paragraph of the post, barnwell-hagemeyer claimed the gop nomination could be hijacked by donald trump, a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.\n\nlater, when trump actually won the gop nomination and kasich and sen. ted cruz (r-tx) dropped out of the race, barnwell-hagemeyer reposted in another since-deleted facebook post an open letter that sen. ben sasse (r-ne) wrote to what he called majority america, and in which sasse said of people who genuinely believed either trump or democrat hillary rodham clinton were honorable people that they were rare souls.\n\nbarnwell-hagemeyer in more posts even after trump won the nomination continued hyping his opposition to trump. in a june 7, 2016, facebook comment in response to someone who shared a los angeles times article about how former california gov. arnold schwarzenegger voted for kasich—his candidate—barnwell-hagemeyer wrote, so you're telling me there's a chance? kasich had dropped out of the race more than a month beforehand.\n\nthen later, in october 2016, barnwell-hagemeyer attacked trump in a still-public post for saying the election was rigged, claiming the man who would become president was engaging in dangerous commentary for attacking clinton in that way. elections are not rigged. period, he wrote. to even discuss this dystopian talking point as reality is not only blatantly wrong, it's dangerous.\n\nelections are not rigged. period. to even discuss this dystopian talking point as reality is not only blatantly wrong,… posted by forrest barnwell-hagemeyer on wednesday, october 19, 2016\n\nbarnwell-hagemeyer is not the only never trump ideologue on sethi's payroll. sethi's campaign chairman and senior adviser chris devaney in august 2015 tweeted praise for an op-ed that cast doubt on trump's promise to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico and bashed trump's candidacy for the white house. devaney tweeted that the op-ed, from his friend veteran presidential campaign staffer dean rice, was good.\n\ngood op/ed by my friend dean rice, a veteran of two presidential campaigns, on trump. http://t.co/ajdnpji9iv — chris devaney (@formerchairman) august 17, 2015\n\nin the op-ed that sethi's campaign chairman praised, rice accuses trump of bombastic macho-ism and sleight of rhetorical hand that he argues has caused supporters to mistake rudeness for honesty and bad temperament for conviction.\n\ntrump is no more honest than the next politician — some are, and some are not, just as in any other segment of american life, rice wrote. he is also just as political as any person in washington. you don't have to hold public office to be political.\n\nalso in the op-ed that sethi's top adviser praised, he accuses trump's supporters of harboring a gut-level notion that somehow america was greatest when it was white, male, christian, and straight—in other words accusing trump supporters of being racist, sexist, anti-gay religious bigots.\n\nin addition to those slurs against trump supporters, sethi's campaign chairman's friend wrote that trump was lying when he promised to build a wall. trump knows well there will never be a physical wall built across our entire border with mexico, he wrote, adding that trump's promise was fantasy not policy.\n\ndevaney and barnwell-hagemeyer are not alone among sethi's senior campaign staff in bashing trump. sethi's general consultant jordan gehrke, a longtime political operative who's also worked with sasse over in nebraska, has a history of bashing the president on twitter.\n\nin several tweets throughout 2015 and 2016, for instance, gehrke repeatedly tweeted that trump was a plant by the democrats in the gop primary—even calling him a manchurian candidate in one and accusing the now-president of deliberate subterfuge in the gop primary that would benefit clinton in another:\n\nseriously, if i were hillary clinton and i were trying to screw up the gop primary, i couldn't do a better job than trump is right now. — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) august 5, 2015\n\nmore evidence that trump is the manchurian candidate. had a private call with bill clinton right before announcing. http://t.co/hypkgn5oax — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) august 5, 2015\n\nin other tweets, gehkre called trump a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy and mocked trump's promise to nominate conservative judges and justices:\n\nyo, superpacs: you won't stop trump by calling him a fake conservative. go at his strengths– as a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy. — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) february 1, 2016\n\ntrump says he knows two corinthians, either one of whom would make fantastic judges. — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) february 14, 2016\n\nhe also falsely accused then-trump campaign manager now senior campaign adviser corey lewandowski of assault:\n\nit's awful that we are this far into the debate & nobody has asked trump why he hasn't fired lewandowski for assaulting @michellefields. — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) march 11, 2016\n\nand just two days before trump wrapped the gop nomination in indiana, gehrke falsely predicted trump would lose in november and said anyone who supports trump is stained by him forever while urging people not to sell their soul by supporting trump:\n\nnot true. anyone who supports trump is stained by him forever. don't sell your soul, kids. he's gonna lose anyway. https://t.co/b9ovjpwbq3 — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) may 4, 2016\n\nin his state in tennessee, sethi's highest-profile endorsements, former u.s. rep. zach wamp and his son weston wamp, both have regularly bashed trump even after he was president.\n\nzach wamp, in august 2017—nearly a year after trump won the election and months into his presidency—attacked the president claiming he put all republicans at risk:\n\npolitics is about addition, not subtraction. as president trump turns on basically everyone, who goes down with him ? the gop-all at risk. — zach wamp (@iowamp) august 17, 2017\n\nweston wamp, as recently as 2018, was publicly defending now former sen. bob corker (r-tn)—a devout never trump senator who regularly undermined trump:\n\nthat's insulting. i disagree with corker often, but i won't let his independence from trump make him a rino. after all, trump isn't a conservative. i asked for a senator more principled on the national debt and you sent me ranking by a libertarian think tank. — weston wamp (@westonwamp) september 18, 2018\n\nhe also claimed trump is not even a conservative:\n\ni get that. but supporting the president at every juncture is not a conservative litmus test, it's a loyalty test. as you know and i know, trump is not even a conservative in the traditional sense. — weston wamp (@westonwamp) september 18, 2018\n\njust last year, in 2019, zach wamp sent out a number of other tweets attacking trump and siding with both the late sen. john mccain (r-az) and mccain's daughter meghan mccain:\n\n@realdonaldtrump mr. president-this is a loser for you. pivot back to your core issues. quit being trivial and punitive with people. you're the leader of the free world for heavens sake. please focus on helping people. #prayingforamerica

the course of 2018 and 2019 and even into 2020 while they have been backing sethi:\n\nno one in dc has any credibility on spending or fiscal responsibility- not president trump, not senate

2020\n\nperhaps most interestingly about this story of sethi surrounding himself—by choice and with his campaign staff hiring decisions—with never trumpers is the fact that sethi refuses in any respect to address it at all.\n\nafter nearly a week of asking about this, his campaign consultant gehrke sent a statement from campaign spokeswoman adrienne walker to breitbart news that did not address any of the questions sent to sethi's campaign about his entire senior staff. the statement simply claims that sethi supported trump in the earliest days of the 2016 presidential primary campaign and attacks his opponent hagerty—who actually did support the president and is endorsed by the president—by asserting that hagerty supported other republicans in the primary.\n\ndr. manny supported president trump from the beginning in the 2016 primary campaign while bill hagerty was with jeb bush and then marco rubio, sethi spokeswoman walker said in the provided statement. there's one real conservative in this race: manny sethi.\n\nthrough gehrke, as well, all of the never trumpers including himself exposed in this article refused interviews and would not even say if they still hold the views they have expressed against the president over the years. they all—from gehrke to barnwell-hagemeyer to the wamps to devaney—refused any questions at all about their never trump histories or whether they still hold those views.\n\nwhat's even more curious about this case is that sethi's campaign had been practically begging breitbart news for months to feature sethi in an interview and to highlight his campaign by claiming he was the real outsider in the race. they repeatedly claimed that breitbart news coverage of the trump-endorsed hagerty, with whom the president just conducted a virtual town hall and with whom sen. tom cotton (r-ar) is campaigning in tennessee later this week, was somehow a betrayal of the base and selling out in some respect. but when breitbart news accepted the offer to interview sethi and told the campaign that these never trump staffers would be a topic of the interview since sethi had been portraying himself as an outsider but surrounded himself with political consultants like the above exposed individuals, sethi's consultants abruptly pulled back and canceled sethi's plans to sit for the interview thereby hiding the candidate and protecting themselves from public scrutiny over their actions.\n\ntrademark political moves from gehrke's and barnwell-hagemeyer's previous campaigns are on display in this race. sasse's 2014 u.s. senate primary, for instance, was one where he portrayed himself—just like sethi is doing—as the conservative outsider in the race. when breitbart news approached gehrke back then with questions regarding sasse's position on immigration levels to the united states, he had promised to answer them and provide quotes from sasse or his team on the matter. then, after several days went by, gehrke ended up finally giving a quote that did not fully answer the question and left open the possibility that sasse would support increases in legal immigration—all while gehkre lined up endorsements from senators like sen. ted cruz (r-tx) for sasse in the final days of the campaign. interestingly, on wednesday, cruz just endorsed sethi in tennessee—just like he did for sasse—despite all of these career consultants around him.\n\nbut one of the other topics that sethi refuses to discuss—again, in addition to the never trump consultants around him, this is one topic that breitbart news had said it wanted to ask him about that instead led to sethi's team pulling back its aggressive requests for a breitbart news interview with the candidate—was simply whether sethi approves of the way sasse has handled himself as a senator since winning that primary and later the general election in 2014. sasse has, during the trump presidency, regularly attacked the president and criticized the way trump has governed. the two seem to have mostly buried the hatchet, at least for now, with the president endorsing his reelection. but sasse has, alongside now former sens. corker and jeff flake (r-az) as well as now sen. mitt romney (r-ut), been a thorn in trump's side on important matters repeatedly attacking him and lending the credibility of a so-called self-proclaimed conservative to anti-trump narratives from the left and establishment media.\n\nin addition to his work for kasich, barnwell-hagemeyer previously worked for now tennessee gov. bill lee in 2018. a pollster connected to gehrke, jmc analytics, conducted a survey in that primary showing lee ahead of his opponent by six percent shortly before the primary. the jmc poll, local outlets reported at the time, gave lee a surge in energy in the final weeks and he ended up winning the primary. the polling firm insisted it was acting independently, but gehrke has a stake in victory phones—a company that jmc has used for auto-dialing to conduct polling in some races. similarly, in this race, jmc analytics has released a poll this week in the u.s. senate primary showing hagerty leading by just four percent over sethi. there have been a number of recent polls in the primary, but this one was the best news yet for sethi—if it were true. it seems to be what enticed cruz, who has endorsed other gehrke clients like sasse in the past, into the race.\n\nwhat's different between the 2018 race when this tactic—the release of a poll showing momentum that turned into actual campaign momentum—worked and this time, however, is the jmc poll did not even show sethi in the lead like the 2018 poll did for lee.\n\ntennessee senate republican primary:\n\nbill hagerty 36% (+4)\n\nmanny sethi 32%\n\ngeorge flinn 5%@winwithjmc, with leaners, 7/18-19https://t.co/0exsnzovow #tnsen — political polls (@politics_polls) july 21, 2020\n\nthe fact that sethi has made a campaign decision to refuse to address any of this—and instead is just counter-attacking his opponent hagerty claiming hagerty is an establishment republican while claiming he is the real conservative despite mounting evidence to the contrary—lends credence to the hagerty criticisms of sethi as a fraud who is falsely claiming to be an outsider, much like sasse did when he ran as such in 2014 then got to washington and incessantly stabbed trump in the back. hagerty's team highlighted sethi's history as a bureaucratic doctor in massachusetts—where he lived before he moved to tennessee—and his prior support for obamacare.\n\na new television ad that hagerty's team launched this week claims conservatives cannot trust sethi, citing his history of serving on the board of a massachusetts medical group that supported obamacare and that shows unearthed video of sethi defending obamacare. some people call that obamacare, sethi says in the video footage. don't say that in public circles because that's a very political statement. it's the patient protection and affordable care act.\n\nhagerty's team also rolled out a website called massachusetts manny that claims he is too liberal for tennessee, including much of what's in the new ad and more including that sethi made a small contribution to actblue—the political fundraising arm of the democrat party—when he lived in massachusetts. sethi also, documents contained on the hagerty team's website unveil, applied for a job in former president barack obama's administration before he later moved to tennessee.
the associated press accused the trump administration of having wasted months in the fight against coronavirus on sunday morning, claiming that federal contracts for needed medical supplies were only made in mid-march.\n\nthe term wasted appears in a quote from former obama administration secretary of health and human services kathleen sebelius, who resigned several months after the obamacare website crashed upon launch in 2013.\n\nthe ap reports:\n\nas the first alarms sounded in early january that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in china might ignite a global pandemic, the trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment. a review of federal purchasing contracts by the associated press shows federal agencies waited until mid-march to begin placing bulk orders of n95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. … we basically wasted two months, kathleen sebelius, health and human services secretary during the obama administration, told ap.\n\nthe trump administration has said that procuring medical supplies was primarily a state responsibility, and that the federal stockpile was meant to serve as an emergency backup, not as a primary source of supplies.\n\nthe los angeles times reported last month that california had built up a large stockpile of thousands of ventilators, 50 million respirator masks, and several mobile hospital units under republican gov. arnold schwarzenneger. however, his democratic successors cut the funding necessary to maintain the stockpiles, and never restored them.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news and the host of breitbart news sunday on sirius xm patriot on sunday evenings from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. et (4 p.m. to 7 p.m. pt). he earned an a.b. in social studies and environmental science and public policy from harvard college, and a j.d. from harvard law school. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
president donald trump suggested friday that he is learning not to trust gop leaders as he pushes for the border wall and promotes his popular pro-american trade and immigration agendas.\n\nwould have been great to do it earlier, trump said about the 2019 appropriation of $1.375 billion for building 55 miles of border wall. he continued his veiled criticism of gop leaders in congress:\n\ni was a little new to the job, little new to the profession and we had a little disappointment for the first year-and-a-half. people that should have stepped up didn't step up. they didn't step up and they should have. would have been easy … it would have been a lot easier [than now]. but some people didn't step up. we're stepping up now. we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion, whether it's $8 billion or $2 billion, or $1.5 billion it's going to build a lot of walls. we're getting it done. we're right now in construction with walls in some of the most important areas, and we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall.\n\nthe admission came during the february 15 press conference in the rose garden, shortly before trump signed the 2019 spending bill. the law may allow construction of just 55 miles of border wall, it curbs enforcement, and it offers an amnesty option to any illegals who offer to care for some of the children and teenagers who are smuggled into the united states as unaccompanied alien children.\n\nin a response to a question, trump said i am learning:\n\ni never did politics before. now i do politics. i will tell you i'm very disappointed at certain people, particularly one, for not having pushed this faster. but i've learned. [was it former] speaker [paul] ryan? let's not talk about it, what difference does it make? but they should have pushed it faster. they should have pushed it harder, and they didn't, they didn't. if they would have, it would have been a little bit better.\n\noverall, the gop leadership worked with trump to pass tax cuts and to cut the cost of the obamacare program. but it has fought trump tooth-and-nail on his efforts to block migrants with a border wall and legal reforms, and it has rebuffed trump's plans to reduce migration. those populist, wage-boosting goals are opposed by investors and business groups, which gain wealth when the federal government imports one million legal immigrant workers and consumers each year.\n\nin the press conference, trump largely ignored the 2019 border security bill, but repeated his 2018 calls for border reforms and for reductions in chain migration and for ending the visa lottery:\n\nwe have catch-and-release. you catch a criminal and you have to release him …. you have chain migration where a bad person comes in and brings in 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sisters, cousins, his uncle they're all in … then you have the lottery, it is a horror show.\n\nhowever, gop leaders made clear shortly after the november 2016 election that they oppose his lower immigration agenda. in december 2016, for example, breitbart news reported:\n\nwe all agree that some of president trump's proposed policies are not going to line up very well with our conservative policies, texas rep. bill flores told an inside-the-beltway audience on dec. 1. let's do the things where we agree — let's do tax reform, lets do obamacare, lets replace obamacare, let's start dealing with border security, let's rebuild our national security and then, on those areas where his agenda is not exactly aligned with ours … then, we'll figure out the rest in the next six months, flores told arthur brooks, president of the american enterprise institute. … flores also said that if the gop takes the lead, trump also will be less likely to push his populist agenda by changing agency policies and regulations. the gop leadership will just tell him, 'hey, we'll take the lead on this, and we will give you the legislative and constitutional support to go forward,' and that way, he's not inclined to use a pen, to try to follow the obama model, said flores.\n\nin february 2018, the senate's gop majority leader, mitch mcconnell, helped gop and democratic senators vote down trump's four pillars immigration reform plan. in the summer of 2018, house speaker ryan helped block a matching reform in the house which was drafted by rep. bob goodlatte, the chairman of the house judiciary committee.\n\nso far, trump has kept his hire american policy, which is helping to drive up wages for americans. in 2018, for example, wages rose by three percent nationally, and by higher levels in areas with few migrants. minnesota employees, for example, enjoyed a wage raise of 5.2 percent, while migrant-heavy texas gained only a two percent increase in wages.
comedian kathy griffin ripped president trump's tribute to sen. john mccain (r-az) shortly after his death was announced saturday evening, in a profanity-laced tweet.\n\ntake his name out of your mouth you piece of sh*t. you maligned his military service while you did everything to avoid serving. you attacked him repeatedly while you knew he was dying. and you cozied up to putin while he did everything he could to oppose him. fuck you, kathy griffin tweeted.\n\ntake his name out of your mouth you piece of shit. you maligned his military service while you did everything to avoid serving. you attacked him repeatedly while you knew he was dying. and you cozied up to putin while he did everything he could to oppose him. fuck you https://t.co/mepgrjjkpf — kathy griffin (@kathygriffin) august 26, 2018\n\nshe was referring to trump's tweet about mccain's death, which said simply: my deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of senator john mccain. our hearts and prayers are with you!\n\ngriffin then retweeted others' reactions bashing trump.\n\nother celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, seizing the moment to make mccain's death about hating trump.\n\nhow dare you. you are the absolute worst kind of hypocrite, dj and music producer moby wrote.\n\nhow dare you. you are the absolute worst kind of hypocrite. https://t.co/inyqp63gfr — moby xⓥx (@thelittleidiot) august 26, 2018\n\nactor ron perlman tweeted: …and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter john mccain's name. not good enough. and definitely not american enough.\n\n…and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter john mccain's name. not good enough. and definitely not american enough. — ron perlman (@perlmutations) august 26, 2018\n\nmccain and trump were no fans of each other stemming from the early days of the 2016 presidential elections, trading barbs and insults.\n\nmccain was diagnosed with brain cancer in july 2017. afterward, he voted down the repeal of obamacare in the senate, further incurring trump's wrath.\n\nthe mccain family made it known that trump would not be invited to his funeral. but in the past several months, trump had quieted his attacks.
dr. ezekiel emanuel, an architect of obamacare and special advisor to the director-general of the world health organization, accused president donald trump of being ignorant and incoherent regarding his administration's response to the deadly chinese coronavirus.\n\ni found most of what he said a little incoherent, emanuel told msnbc's hardball on wednesday, noting that the president was surprised to learn how many people die from the flu each year.\n\ni found most of what he said incoherent. — dr. ezekiel emanuel on trump's press conference regarding the coronavirus. #hardball pic.twitter.com/hihxyls1e5 — hardball (@hardball) february 27, 2020\n\nyou know, he's a guy that admitted that he's surprised that 25,000 to 69,000 people each year die of the flu. that just tells you how little he actually knows about public health and about the health of the american public, emanuel continued. he just revealed how ignorant he is about the situation. we don't know how similar or dissimilar this is to the flu.\n\nwe know one thing. it is actually more communicable than the flu. it passes between people very, very easily, he added.\n\nemanuel's criticism followed a press conference where president trump announced the appointment of vice president mike pence on wednesday to lead the united states' response to the illness that originated in wuhan, china.\n\npresident trump said pence will work with professionals, doctors and others working on the response to the disease known as covid-19 and will report back directly to him.\n\nwe have no higher priority than the safety, security, health and wellbeing of the american people, pence said during a news conference at the white house.\n\nhealth and human services secretary alex azar said there have been 15 cases of covid-19 in the united states in addition to three cases of people who came from the chinese city of wuhan, the epicenter of the virus and 42 who were brought in from the diamond princess cruise ship, which docked in japan.\n\npresident trump said that many of the people who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing very well.\n\nof the 15 people… eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. one is in the hospital, five have fully recovered and one we think is in pretty good shape, he said. in almost all cases, they're getting better.\n\nthe upi contributed to this report.
sen. ted cruz is defending ice officer chris crane, following sen. marco rubio's seeming attempt to denounce the war veteran as a conspiracy theorist for claiming law enforcement's concerns were ignored in the obama-championed gang of eight bill co-authored by sen. rubio.\n\nthe brave agents of ice and border patrol risk their lives every day keeping us safe, cruz said. it is troubling to the extent it appears that marco shut out ice and law enforcement leaders just to appease the democrats on his gang of eight amnesty bill. that reflects a lack of judgment, and an alarming willingness to advance the interests of the washington cartel at the expense of public safety and national security.\n\non friday, crane— whom jeff sessions has described as an american hero for his courage to blow the whistle on immigration corruption— publicly detailed for the first time since the presidential race began how sen. rubio treated law enforcement like absolute trash during rubio's effort to pass his donor-backed amnesty bill.\n\nin an effort to dismiss crane's substantive criticisms, sen. rubio attacked crane on national television— implicitly denouncing crane's 13 years of service as an ice officer. he's not an ice official. he's the head of a union, rubio said. i literally don't even talk about the things they [i.e. breitbart news] report because they're basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. and that individual is not an ice official. he's the head of a union.\n\nhowever, this directly contradicts rubio's prior statements in 2013 about crane when it was politically expedient for rubio to tout having met with law enforcement official and ice agent chris crane.\n\nsenator rubio did meet with mr. crane, and we welcome his suggestions to improve the bill, rubio's spokesman alex conant wrote in an april 2013 email to breitbart news. our legislation is not a take-it or leave-it proposition – we welcome input and ideas from mr. crane and other law enforcement officials as the senate works to improve the proposal… ultimately, we share mr. crane's frustrations with the current, broken immigration system and his frustrations with the current administration's failure to enforce our laws. that is why we're working to fix the system, and why we want law enforcement's input.\n\nwhen one of rubio's constituents from melbourne, florida asked rubio why isn't your gang of eight calling on ice for their input into border security, rubio replied:\n\nwe did get input from ice. i actually met with a gentleman named chris crane, he's the president of the union for the ice agents. we met for about an hour, an hour and a half… his frustration, and the frustration of many ice agents, is that they're not being allowed to enforce the law… these are valid points that we've heard… we have taken their input, we continue to seek their input. and i have nothing but the highest respect for the men and women who are on the front lines of trying to enforce our laws even though sometimes the politicians get in the way.\n\nin recent weeks, honesty has become a central issue of the 2016 race. rubio has repeatedly hit cruz as a liar. at the most recent republican debate, rubio said: this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, ted cruz has just been telling lies.\n\nrubio doubled down on his charge the following day on cnn's state of the union: the bottom line is there's been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from ted cruz of just saying things that are not true.\n\nrubio then reiterated the accusation at a cnn moderated town hall last week. i said he's been lying because if you say something that isn't true and you say it over and over again and you know that it's not true, there's no other word for it.\n\nin particular, rubio took issue with cruz's accusation that rubio said on national television in spanish that rubio would not immediately end obama's executive 2012 amnesty on day one of his presidency. rubio claimed this was a lie– despite the fact that rubio not only made this assertion in spanish— but rubio also reiterated his spanish-language declaration that he wouldn't undo it [obama's 2012 amnesty] immediately in english.\n\nin an english-language interview, rubio said of obama's 2012 amnesty, i don't think we can immediately revoke that… i'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away. instead rubio adopted president obama's position on the matter, declaring that it will have to end at some point and that he hopes it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws—i.e. the president ought to leave the executive amnesty for dreamers in place until congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty.\n\nrubio also criticized cruz's campaign for putting out what appeared to be satirical photo of rubio and obama shaking hands— in an effort to highlight rubio's effort to give obama fast-track executive trade authority. although the appearance of the photo could arguably have been labeled a caricature, rubio sought to diffuse the substance of the attack—which focused on rubio's support for obamatrade— by treating the satirically-minded photo as a serious transgression. this is how phony and how deceitful the cruz campaign has become, rubio's senior adviser said.\n\nviolent street gangs were literally able to lobby sen. rubio and the gang of eight more effectively than law enforcement, they had more influence on the bill than we did, crane said in his exclusive interview with breitbart news published friday.\n\nin a 15-page memo outlining rubio's betrayal of the conservative movement, grassroots heroine and living legend phyllis schlafly documented rubio record of lying to conservative media and the many falsehoods he told at the time. his deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded obama's claims about disastrous obamacare, schlafly wrote.\n\nfor instance, rubio said border security would precede amnesty– a fact he later admitted was not the case in a 2013 spanish language interview.\n\nrubio claimed his bill transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, schlafly explained.\n\nrubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to 'pay taxes and undergo a background check,' schlafly pointed out. however, there is no such thing as 'back taxes,' for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability. similarly, with regards to the background checks, rubio's bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.\n\nrubio told conservatives that under his bill, the size of the future population of the united states will not be significantly impacted by this legislation. however, schlafly notes that the cbo, migration policy institute, numbersusa, center for immigration studies, and senator sessions' office all painstakingly documented the massive immigration increases in the bill.\n\nrubio claimed his bill was the toughest border security and enforcement plan in u.s. history, yet schlafly writes, the final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself… rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him.

while speaking to a crowd in cedar rapids, ia, 2020 presidential hopeful sen. amy klobuchar (d-mn) called for universal healthcare in the united states, saying she wanted the public option system that former president barack obama sought in the past but failed to get congress to pass it as a part of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.\n\nwe need universal healthcare in this country, right, klobuchar said to applause. health care shouldn't be a privilege. that means the most immediate way to do this is a public option, something that barack obama wanted to do … a public option with either with medicaid or medicare that would bring the prices down for everyone. we need to take on the pharmaceutical crisis and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nfollow trent baker on twitter @magnifitrent
breitbart news editor-in-chief alex marlow joined patrick courrielche for red pilled america's 50th episode — the first of a two-part profile — to reflect on his political genesis and andrew breitbart's vision for the news media outlet he founded.\n\ncourrielche contextualized his profile of marlow against the backdrop of breitbart news's ascendance within the news media landscape.\n\npound for pound, it's undeniable that breitbart news is the most influential media outlet in america, determined courrielche. this media organization that started in the basement of its founder's home has helped propel a man into the white house, retired politicians, cratered the popularity of bad legislation. [it] has even sent a movie box office soaring and helped tank a few others. the list of alumni and early contributors to breitbart news looks like a who's who of conservative media: steve bannon, milo yiannopoulos, ben shapiro, steven crowder, dana loesch, james o'keefe, sebastian gorka, larry o'connor, greg gutfeld, andrew klavan, christian toto, [and] kurt schlichter.\n\nbreitbart news foes, added courrilche, further demonstrate this news media outlet's impact. hollywood, big tech, our far-left education system, and the political establishments of both parties have all unsuccessfully tried to take [breitbart news] down — or at least quiet them — but they've all failed, he said.\n\ncourielche noted, one analysis showed that it drove not only conservative media in 2016, but also the broader mainstream news coverage, and another recent study revealed that breitbart news is crushing the mainstream media on facebook, racking up more interactions than the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal, and usa today combined, and is even outpacing both cable news networks msnbc and cnn on mark zuckerberg's social media platform.\n\nmarlow's consumption of conservative talk radio during commutes to and from middle school played a role in marlow's philosophical development.\n\nalex's awakening began, innocently enough, during his middle school commute, explained courrielche. back and forth between home and middle school, alex was getting a steady diet of conservative commentary that was in direct conflict [with] what he was hearing from his middle school teacher and tv.\n\nlisten:\n\n\n\nmarlow recalled, i started noticing the contrast between what my parents were listening to on the radio and what i was hearing from the rest of the media [and] learning in the classroom. … i would listen to a guy named larry elder — who is still a nationally syndicated broadcaster — and he really expanded my horizons.\n\nmarlow's matriculation at harvard westlake — a college preparatory day school — further developed his ideological perspective. harvard westlake [is] arguably the most academically rigorous high school on the west coast, noted courrielche. just outside of beverly hills, harvard westlake is populated by the elite of hollywood's elite.\n\ncourrielche added, [harvard westlake] has a parent and student alumni list that includes actors jodi foster, jack nicholson, barbara streisand, mel brooks, bruce springsteen, candice bergen, shirley temple, jake and maggie gyllenhal, bridget fonda, jamie lee curtis, tori spelling, california gov. gray davis, and los angeles mayor eric garcetti, just to name a few. so in his high school years, alex was steeped in elite liberal orthodoxy.\n\nit was within this competitive liberal enclave that alex's right-of-center worldview, oddly, began to solidify, courrielche stated.\n\nmarlow described harvard westlake as the ritziest, most prestigious private school is los angeles, adding, it's an ultra-one-percenter environment.\n\nmarlow's introduction to the drudge report via his father added to his political progression. my dad recommended to me — when i was in the tenth grade — that i start going to the drudge report, he shared. i fell in love with drudge report almost instantly. … this was the greatest hack in the history of information, that i could go to this page and i could get updated on almost the entirety of what's happening on planet earth in a heartbeat.\n\nmarlow described his early forays into political controversy as enjoyable. i was triggering people with what i thought were pretty fundamental ideas, he said. i got very intrigued by that, and it only pushed me to explore those ideas further, and it caused me to read more [and] study more. right-of-center ideas were uncommon in west los angeles and the heart of hollywood, he added, describing broad suppression of conservative ideas in the region as a draw to further investigate conservatism.\n\nbeing the object of leftist contempt inspired marlow to expand his political knowledge base.\n\ni had very handily beaten a couple of really smart people in the high school democrat club [in a debate about the environment], recalled marlow, and then i was told that one of the teachers had called me an 'ignorant moron' to his class, and that, to me, was a jolt. that was a very exciting moment for me, to have triggered an adult teacher — an authority figure — by simply winning a debate. … it didn't scare me in the slightest, and that was a very seminal moment for me, because i realized that when i win a debate and then get attacked, there was something about that that made me hungry to learn more and fight harder.\n\nmarlow's attraction to political controversy drew him to the university of california, berkeley, given its role as a hub of left-wing ideology.\n\nwhen i got into uc berkeley, i immediately saw the path for me, marlow remarked, which is that i had to go to uc berkeley because of their politics, because of their reputation as not just being extremely left, but being the home of the free speech movement. … a lot of people at harvard westlake were decrying big classes. they wanted you to have a … hands-on, small, touchy-feely environment. i didn't like that as much. i liked the idea of a big sprawling diverse campus — but diverse in terms of ideas — and i liked the history of the leftism. i thought that would be a challenge. i wanted to see it. i wanted to go inside the belly of the beast.\n\ncourrielche assessed marlow's educational pedigree as a training ground for his future career in news media.\n\nit was an exhilarating time for alex, a guy that seemed to be somehow immune to the ideas of the left, courrielche said. i mean, think about it. alex grew up in the heart of liberal los angeles, attended a private high school populated entirely by hollywood elites, and was now being educated in practically the headquarters of the institutional left at uc berkeley. alex was steeped in the ideology of the far-left, yet still gravitated towards conservatism. being comfortable as the outlier must have been an intellectual boot camp for alex, preparing him for what was to come.\n\nmarlow recalled his first time meeting andrew breitbart.\n\nandrew gave this speech about how culture is upstream from politics, recalled marlow of breitbart's articulation of a now widely known axiom. growing up in hollywood, and seeing the power and influence of my peers' parents at harvard westlake and elsewhere, it was so obvious this guy was right on the money, and i loved movies and i loved music, and it was so clear what andrew was saying, and it never dawned on me, that of course, the politicians were taking cues from the cultural actors, not the other way around. i had never heard this before.\n\ndescribing breitbart's speech –particularly the identification of culture's shaping of politics — as an epiphany, marlow recalled introducing himself to his future mentor in the lobby bar of the hotel.\n\n[andrew breitbart] lived about three miles from me, at the time, where i grew up. … we had the same interests, baseball, music, he had an incredible sense of humor — i was always a huge comedy fan — so we had so much in common, marlow recalled. core interests, similar politics, similar background, lived in similar places, even had the same hobbies. … it was a pretty clear match that we were kindred spirits.\n\nmarlow and courrielche recalled breitbart news's breaking of the nea story, detailing the obama administration's deployment of the national endowment of the arts to push left-wing ideology and its own partisan political agenda.\n\ncourrielche explained, in a nutshell, we recorded a white house conference call where the obama administration tried to use a federal arts agency — the nea — to create propaganda, all to sell the american people on obamacare. … the nea story [was when] we caught the obama administration trying to turn the national endowment of the arts into a propaganda machine. … they encouraged us to create art on health care, on energy and the environment, and they wanted us to bring whatever art network [or] talent that we had to those issues. at the time, some experts claimed that the effort might have violated a law prohibiting federal funds for being used for political activities.\n\nthe 2009 launch of big hollywood seized on a vacancy for right-of-center news media outlets within a landscape dominated by leftism, said marlow. a huge space [existed] for a right-of-center worldview in the media space, he said. big hollywood launched the day after president obama's inauguration, and it was the beginning of an opposition to the establishment media narrative that largely hinged on [framing] obama as the messiah.\n\ncourrielche shared audio of an interview in which andrew breitbart explained big hollywood's purpose:\n\nthe number one reason [for big hollywood's launch] is that the conservative movement has completely detached itself from the concept of popular culture and thinks it can survive in the 21st century on politics and legislation alone, and political rhetoric and great writing reflecting conservative principles, and that's not going to happen. what needs to happen is that the conservative movement — based in washington, dc, for the most part, and with ancillary entities around the country, new york city, dallas, virginia — these people have ignored anything west of the mississippi for a generation, and they're suffering the consequences, and the election of obama is evidence of that. the conservative movement proper did not embrace ronald reagan initially, but it eventually came to accept him as the standard bearer of conservatism. he was successful less because he carried conservative principles, but [more] because he came from hollywood and he understood the importance of communication and pop culture. it took [the conservative movement] a long time to realize that that magic was a good way to sell conservatism — that bright-eyed optimism — and so the conservative movement needs to go focus on hollywood in countless ways. it needs to encourage its young to go out to hollywood and become screenwriters actors, producers, below-the-line workers. it also needs to focus on hollywood proper, film reviews, and become engaged in the debate out there. it's interesting that we have so many people in the conservative movement who write about legislation and political controversies every single day. as a matter of fact, here seems to be about 50 people writing on the same subject all day long, but very few people focus on pop culture, and pop culture is the dna of who we are, and we export that through the satellite dishes and in our dvds and your films and on the television screen and on film across the world, and if we don't alter that dna, if we don't try to inject in it our best qualities and not our worst qualities, our fate is in the hands of people who don't agree with us. … so we have to take them on using their skills. so that's the primary objective [of the site]. i'd say the secondary objective of the site is to create cover for those who exist in hollywood, right now, who actually are conservative or libertarian, or who consider themselves to be lieberman democrats or jfk liberals, people who don't necessarily relate to the current boutique leftism that seems to be intent on squelching any type of dissent, especially dissent that is right-of-center, and i believe the site will provide cover for those people.\n\njohn nolte, senior editor-at-large and founding editor of the breitbart blog big hollywood, said of big hollywood's launch, it was a movement of real artists that wanted a voice … and there was something happening, so it felt right away like it was important and it made a difference.\n\nadryana cortez, patrick's wife and co-host of red pilled america, recalled the acorn scandal broken by james o'keefe with help from andrew breitbart. acorn was a community-organizing group founded in 1970 purported to advocate for low-income families. at its peak, it had roughly 500,000 members in 1,200 neighborhood chapters all across the country, she explained. the group worked with the federal government for the census, and it also had ties to a [barack obama's 2008] political campaign. … perhaps the biggest under-reported scandal tied to [acorn] was its work in the banking sector. acorn played a key role in helping cause the financial crisis by pressuring local banks to lend to poor and financially unstable people.\n\ncourrielche said, andrew thought [the acorn story] was the story of his life, not only because it showed a deranged government-funded organization in action, [but] it would also expose the extreme bias in the media. you see, this was way before 'fake news' became a household phrase. many right-of-center folks were aware of the media bias, but almost no one understood how corrupt the press had become. andrew was going to expose that fact not just by calling out their bias …. instead he was going to expose it by showing that they would ignore a massive story that hurts the left.\n\ncourrielche quoted breitbart's description of the acorn story's importance as written in breitbart's book, righteous indignation: excuse me while i save the world!:\n\nit seemed that if the acorn story and nea story could be paired and weaponized, maximized, and forced into the eye of the american public, they could serve as a case study demonstrating the new media could supplant [the] old media. these paired stories could serve as notice that if the mainstream media wouldn't take helpful hints to right the ship, they were going to experience something akin to a mutiny.\n\nmarlow said, [andrew breitbart] was basically laying out how the media [were] not only going to miss the story, they were going to cover up one of the biggest scandals in modern political history. he basically wrote a script with a crystal ball of every step the media would make. … he also revolutionized the drip-drip-drip strategy, where he put out one story at a time to bait the media into saying this is an isolated incident. of course it wasn't. andrew was sitting on piles and piles of tape. … he was such a visionary. he was inventing a playbook. i was sitting there next to him as he was inventing the modern playbook on how to fight the left.\n\nthe legacy of the acorn story is not just the rise of james o'keefe, the rise of breitbart, [and] the destruction of acorn — it is the beginning of the end of the establishment media as gospel, concluded marlow. that was one of the biggest media scandals, ever.\n\ncourrielche concluded the episode with a preview of its sequel, which will examine andrew breitbart's role in the anthony weiner sexting scandal.\n\nfollow robert kraychik on twitter @rkraychik.
the senate approved a three-week spending bill to fund the government for three weeks after senate democrats caved on the schumer shutdown.\n\nthe senate passed the three-week spending bill, 81-18, that will fund the government until february 8. senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-ny) agreed to the stop-gap funding bill after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell gave him a commitment to vote on legislation that will address the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) illegal immigrants.\n\nthe short-term spending bill also funds the children's health insurance program (chip) for six years, while delaying several obamacare taxes, such as the cadillac tax, the medical device tax, as well as the health insurance tax (hit).\n\nthe senate approved the motion on monday afternoon to invoke cloture and end debate, 81-18, featuring overwhelming support.\n\nnow that the senate approved a different spending bill than the house-passed version, the house will have to agree to the slightly shorter spending bill for congress to send it to president donald trump's desk to sign.\n\none senate democrat source told reporters that democrats were well aware of polling suggesting that democrats will take the blame for shutting down the government to force a vote on amnesty for illegal immigration.\n\nschumer argued on the senate floor on monday:\n\nwe will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn't reached by february the 8th, the senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with daca. the process will be neutral and fair to all sides. we expect that a bipartisan bill on daca will receive fair consideration and an up or down vote on the floor.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) said on the senate floor on monday, i think if we learned anything is that a strategy of shutting down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the american people didn't understand.\n\nrep. lou barletta (r-pa), who is challenging sen. bob casey (d-pa) in the 2018 midterms, chided casey for voting to put illegal immigrants ahead of americans.\n\nbarletta argued:\n\nthis government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of americans, and senator casey just confirmed it. on friday, senator casey voted to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. since then, none of the issues that senator casey said he cared about changed, other than the senate agreed to hold a vote on daca. only when casey got assurances that the senate would vote on daca, did casey vote to re-open the government. and i'm sure casey will again deny funding for americans on february 8th if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants.\n\nsen. dick durbin (d-il), argued on monday that amnesty for millions of illegal immigration is the civil rights issue of our time.
henry olsen, author of the working class republican: ronald reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatism, warned of medicare for all democrat proposals gaining popularity in the absence of republican solutions to rising healthcare costs. he offered his analysis in a tuesday interview on siriusxm's breitbart news tonight with hosts rebecca mansour and joel pollak.\n\nmedicare for all is a huge challenge for republicans because a recent poll put out from gallup this month showed that 70 percent of americans believe that our healthcare system has major problems or is in a state of crisis, mansour said. we see the polling that americans are really latching onto this medicare for all thing, including even republican voters, and the gop has no answer to it, really. what do you think is going to happen with this? the gop is not addressing the needs of the median voter that's getting hammered by our current healthcare system.\n\nolsen replied:\n\nthe two wings of the pre-trump gop didn't want to handle it. the libertarian anti-government crowd of the gop didn't think it was right for government to try and step in and regulate private insurers or subsidize private-sector health insurance for people who can't afford it, and the business community didn't want to disturb the private-sector healthcare program and didn't want to pay the taxes to subsidize people. republicans have to understand that [the] most popular part of that phrase is the for all, that americans with experience with medicare tend to like it because when you add in supplemental insurance that they have, it actually provides pretty decent insurance for a pretty low cost.\n\nolsen added, people — as we see even in republican states — are voting for the medicaid expansion because they would like to see poor people and working-class people have access to doctors. so the question is: what do you do with the republicans to make sure that those things are actually being met, but in a way that doesn't lead us down the road to one-size-fits-all bureaucratized government monopoly healthcare?\n\nlisten:\n\n\n\nyou have to engage the people and listen to their concerns, and if you don't do that then what you do is empower people like kamala harris or like elizabeth warren who are going to say, 'their answer is no answer, and mine's the only one on the table. you gotta pick me,' olsen added.\n\nmansour said:\n\npresident trump has often cited australia's system as something that we can perhaps adopt or model our healthcare reform on. well, australia has a two-tiered system — so does singapore and many of these other places that people cite — it's not single-payer, it's not like canada or the u.k. but almost all the two-tiered systems have a feature where you are required to buy health instance, which would be a mandate, which the gop has been dead-set against for so long. they're going to have to face all these things if they're going to avoid the kamala harris-bernie sanders medicare for all socialized medicine.\n\nthe republican party, replied olsen, is too puritanical in its economic disposition.\n\nthis gets down to one of the biggest battles, i think, that needs to be confronted in the republican party, which is the idea that somehow, through sheer force of will and presentation of numbers, we're going to get americans to accept a level of federal government involvement that we have not seen since 1928. that idea is a fantasy, determined olsen.\n\nolsen continued, what we are doing is we are living in a world where people are accepting of some degree of government involvement. they don't want total government control, but they want the government to help average people live dignified lives, and sometimes that means subsidy or regulation.\n\nolsen went on, does it mean a mandate? maybe not. but in australia what they say is that they'll add a tax if you don't buy health insurance, and they'll subsidize you under a certain level of income if you do. that's not that different than obamacare. but it means that you've got nearly 50 percent of australians who have private-sector health insurance and that gives improved healthcare and keeps public sector costs down. is that a better alternative than medicare for all? i would say it is.\n\nthe republican party must reevaluate its approach towards government's role in economic affairs, said olsen.\n\ndoes the republican party see that the federal government has a role to play in helping to address the nation's economic and social challenges? asked olsen. the default position on the right — although they will often deny it — is no.\n\nolsen continued, it's one of the reasons why you saw nothing happen when republicans controlled congress rather than reduce taxes for corporations and wealthy people and some individuals, thanks to marco rubio's tax credit, which most of the leadership fought until they had to give it to us.\n\nolsen concluded, that's just not a selling point with the american people. americans want a limited but effective government. limited in its scope, but effective and engaged to get barriers for average people out of the way, and then the government gets the heck out of the way.\n\nbreitbart news tonight broadcasts live on siriusxm patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. pacific.\n\nfollow robert kraychik on twitter.
even the new york times is conceding that the huge number of americans willing to pay a special tax to escape from obamacare is newsworthy, although the paper tries to sugar-coat the bad news as much as possible:\n\ntwo years after the affordable care act began requiring most americans to have health insurance, 10.5 million who are eligible to buy coverage through the law's new insurance exchanges were still uninsured this fall, according to the obama administration. that number appears to be shrinking: administration officials said last month that about 2.5 million new customers had bought insurance through healthcare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states, since open enrollment began on nov. 1. the number of new enrollees is 29 percent higher than last year at this time, suggesting that the threat of a larger penalty may be motivating more people to get covered. but plenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. they say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.\n\ntranslation: people won't buy obama's lousy insurance, not even when forced to buy it at gunpoint. obvious left-wing solution: use bigger guns.\n\nthis is one of the biggest disasters in the history of american government, and that's saying something. it's also one of the biggest lies ever peddled to the american people. obamacare is fraud on an unprecedented scale. remember, it was sold to the american public as a voluntary exercise – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period. barack obama smugly assured skeptics that his health care plan would be so awesome that millions of americans would rush to drop their old plans and buy into obamacare, saving thousands of dollars in the process.\n\ninstead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health coverage virtually useless. the only reason many people are buying into this scheme is that obama is frog-marching them into it. the new york times analysis frankly acknowledges that word-of-mouth isn't helping.\n\npeople aren't embracing the affordable care act. the only thing improving its catastrophically low enrollment figures is the threat of higher penalties… which could not have been assessed in the first couple of years, because that would have triggered a full-blown revolt against obama and his party.\n\nthe penalties already paid represent one of the biggest tax increases on the middle class in living memory, precisely as obamacare critics warned… and it's a tax people are paying for the privilege of getting nothing. they'd rather pay the irs than give the money to barack obama's cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.\n\nthat means it's time to roll out the scare tactics. we understand some people may be thinking through their choice of coverage, but going without health insurance is a serious gamble that can be catastrophic if wrong, argued health and human services spokesman ben wakana.\n\nah, the fearsome battle cry of the obama ineptocracy: you little people are stupid and don't know what's good for you.\n\non the contrary, the people passing up on obamacare are making entirely rational decisions. they're voting with their wallets, and if they vote the same way with their ballots in 2016, we can finally end this nightmare.\n\nthe nyt article begins with the example of an engineer named clint murphy who concluded it's still better to pay the higher 2016 penalty than to purchase pricey health insurance – in fact, he describes the decision as a no-brainer.\n\nanother subject of the article, 61-year-old susan reardon, said she figures it's better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless obamacare coverage. she felt it's better just to die if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the irs to come and get me for the obama tax.\n\nsome of the other unhappy campers interviewed by the times described themselves as living in fear because obamacare has forced them to make do without health insurance. some were willing to pay the inflated obama premiums at first, but bailed out as soon as they actually tried to use their benefits and were hit with jaw-dropping deductibles. what ringing endorsements of the president's scheme!\n\nincidentally, even though congress refused to give obama's cronies a fat taxpayer bailout in the omnibus spending bill – one of the very few good things about it – the administration is still looking for ways to go around the constitution and loot the treasury to cover what it calls an obligation of the u.s. government for which full payment is required.\n\nif we don't kill obamacare soon, we will get shaken down for billions of dollars to prop up the insurance companies… and that will become another epic middle-class tax increase, on top of the one we've already been hit with, to sustain a scheme very few taxpayers approve of.\n\nall of the democrats' political spin evaporates before the amazing number of people who are willing to pay a special tax to exercise the rights that were taken away from them in 2010.
president obama stated that obamacare is only going to get better during saturday's weekly address.\n\ntranscript as follows:\n\nhi, everybody. when i took office seven years ago this week, more than 15% of americans went without health insurance. for folks who did have coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage or charge you more just because you'd been sick. and too many americans gave up their dreams of changing jobs or going back to school because they couldn't risk giving up their employer-based insurance plan.\n\nwe've changed that. as the affordable care act has taken effect, nearly 18 million americans have gained coverage. in fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of americans are covered. up to 129 million americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage or be charged more just because they've been sick. 137 million americans with private insurance are now guaranteed preventive care coverage. we've done all this while cutting our deficits and keeping health care inflation to its lowest levels in fifty years. and we've begun filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we change jobs, lose a job, go back to school, or start that new business, we can still get coverage.\n\nif you want to know how important that is, just ask an american like heather bragg.\n\nheather's a small business owner in bluffton, south carolina. last year, she wrote me a letter and told me how, for years, her family had depended on her husband's job for their insurance. but thanks to the affordable care act, her husband mike had the freedom to switch jobs and join heather at the small business she'd launched a few years ago.\n\nthrough the health insurance marketplace, they found better coverage that actually saved them hundreds of dollars a month. today, heather only pays about ten dollars for the asthma inhaler she needs. for the first time, heather wrote, we're not living paycheck to paycheck; we're able to pay our bills and put some money back into savings. and because mike doesn't have to work nights or weekends anymore, he can coach their son's soccer team and tuck the kids in at night. and you can't put a price on something like that.\n\nif you haven't looked at your new coverage options, you've still got time to get covered on the health insurance marketplace for 2016. you have until january 31 – next sunday – to enroll. just go to healthcare.gov, cuidadodesalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596. most folks buying a plan on the marketplace can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. even if you already have insurance, take a few minutes to shop around. in fact, consumers who switched to a new plan for 2016 ended up saving an average of more than $500.\n\nthat's what the affordable care act did. this is health care in america today. affordable, portable security for you and your loved ones. it's making a difference for millions of americans every day. and it's only going to get better. thanks, and have a great weekend.\n\nfollow ian hanchett on twitter @ianhanchett
president obama's statement on gun control tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd amendment:\n\nnow, i want to be absolutely clear at the start — and i've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that i have to do — i believe in the second amendment. it's there written on the paper. it guarantees a right to bear arms. no matter how many times people try to twist my words around — i taught constitutional law, i know a little about this — i get it. but i also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the second amendment.\n\nnot a very convincing performance. is there any other amendment to the constitution the president would downplay in this way? saying, it's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th amendment.\n\nif the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. president obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.\n\n1.) here's the president swearing repeatedly, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\n\nas it turns out, that was not true. in fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. when the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. in november 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. as you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.\n\na month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. it was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.\n\n2.) it wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about obamacare. he also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.\n\nunfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in congress and the media were as disciplined. a number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. the president tried to fool the american people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. he almost got away with it.\n\n3.) before he became president, obama told pastor rick warren, i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjhqbz1la0w\n\nhard to be more clear than that. obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. and then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. but had he really? according to chief strategist david axelrod, obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:\n\naxelrod writes that he knew obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. axelrod also admits to counseling obama to conceal that position for political reasons. opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' axelrod writes.\n\nobama reportedly told axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, i'm just not very good at bullshitting. based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
cnn chief white house correspondent jim acosta on friday accused president donald trump of being the take-no-responsibility president after announcing a host of measures — from boosting coronavirus testing availability to suspending interest on federal student loans — to ease concerns as the united states combats the spread of the deadly illness.\n\na partial transcript is as follows:\n\njake tapper: jim, the president was talking about testing for the coronavirus, which obviously has been lagging behind in the u.s., what are the concrete steps that the president announced today that can help speed up the process for testing and the process, if anything was laid out, for improving the ability of hospitals to take in any sort of surge in patients?\n\njim acosta: i think you heard the president there and various officials on the coronavirus task force lay out these next steps. the question is how long this are going to take in terms of getting the system testing moving. the president was saying this, as well as other officials, that they're going to be waiving regulations to make sure that the private lab industry can run these tests more quickly, that they're going to be setting up a website where people can go. it sort of sounded like obamacare, healthcare.gov and it's going to be run by google.\n\n…\n\noverall, i think the question a lot of our viewers at home are going to have is how long is that going to take? when is that going to take place? when can i see that in my community and this president was not getting into those kinds of details. as we saw during this press conference, this was the take-no-responsibility president.
wednesday on abc's the view, the panel discussed president donald trump's ongoing criticisms of late sen. john mccain (r-az) after playing a clip of the president saying, i was never a fan of john mccain and i never will be.\n\nco-host joy behar said, he also said that the republicans had a plan to repeal and replace obamacare. they did not. so he's completely lying in that entire statement. i think he's jealous of your dad. i really do. it's hard to see when somebody's passed away that you would still be jealous of them but this is a psycho that we're talking about here. he's not normal. he's obsessed with people that didn't support him. i'm sure he hates me in the same way. good.\n\nshe added, where is the republican party? the only two senators who came out and vociferously put this man down were romney, my new friend—i like him a little bit —and senator johnny isakson. both of them are not up for re-election until 2022. i don't know about romney, maybe even further than that. so the cowards in the republican party need to be called out. lindsey where is he? he still hasn't found his you-know-what. other people, i think that's the issue here that the mccain family has to deal with, that your party is not stepping up.\n\nco-host meghan mccain said, i'm just surprised because i do think this is a new bizarre low. i will say, attacking someone who isn't here is a bizarre low. my dad's not here but i'm sure as hell here.\n\nbehar added, it's a bizarre low that he attacked your father in the first place and he still won the election. people still follow this guy. you people need to examine yourselves.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen
california governor gavin newsom's first act in office was to propose extending state healthcare benefits to more illegal aliens.\n\non tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in california, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.\n\nin his first executive order, newsom directed the state to create a single government purchaser for prescription drugs to increase negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical companies. alongside the order, newsom proposed extending medi-cal — the state's version of medicaid — to illegal aliens up to the age of 26, rather than 19.\n\nthe governor's forthcoming budget, his office said, will make california the first state in the nation to cover young undocumented adults through a state medicaid program.\n\nthat would cover 138,000 young people in the country illegally, according to the associated press.\n\nundocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, the governor's office added, saying that the budget proposals, to be presented later this week, would defend obamacare from recent federal attacks and bring the state closer toward the goal of health care for all.\n\nin his inaugural address, newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to california's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.\n\nthat policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of corporal ronil singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.\n\nin addition, newsom's new budget proposes increasing the size of the subsidies for families who already receive it, and it would make california the first state to make subsidies available to middle income families, his office said.\n\nto pay for the expansion of those benefits, newsom is proposing that california restore the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, which was canceled by president donald trump at the federal level.\n\nschumer also sent a letter to president trump and to congressional leaders asking for legislative changes that he argues would make it easier for states, including california, to develop a single-payer healthcare system.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
the senate homeland security committee released a report in mid-january that received surprisingly little media attention despite its provocative assertion that obamacare, and particularly its enormous expansion of medicaid, is a driving force behind the opioid epidemic.\n\nthe case laid out by the report is straightforward, logical, and politically unspeakable. it's an argument generally made in hushed tones until now, and it's easy to see why. even the senate homeland security report was swiftly denounced as a partisan fantasy peddled by chairman ron johnson (r-wi) in what little mainstream media coverage it received. thou shalt not speak ill of medicaid.\n\nand yet, the critics could find no way to refute the actual data in the report. they denounced it with thunderous virtue-signaling outrage, attacked those involved in preparing it, criticized arguments it did not make – such as pretending the report claims the opioid epidemic was caused by medicaid expansion, rather than exacerbated by it – or simply assumed that all critiques of medicaid and obamacare must be partisan hit jobs, q.e.d.\n\nthis validates one of the core concerns about politicizing medicine, or any other scientific field, by putting big government in charge of it. rational discussion becomes impossible. every analysis quickly devolves into a partisan brawl.\n\nthe report postulates medicaid expansion is a contributing factor to the epidemic of opioid abuse – not the sole or original cause, as the report itself and sen. johnson took pains to point out, despite mischaracterizations by critics. much of the opioid crisis involves prescription drugs, which can become addictive even when legitimately prescribed, and are often stolen through fraud and resold on the street. medicaid expansion greatly increased access to prescription drugs. medicaid also includes programs to fight drug abuse, but some of those programs involve pharmaceutical treatments that can themselves become addictive, especially when they fall into the hands of street pushers.\n\nit requires no great leap of logic to see the connection between a dramatic increase in access to drugs and a problem driven by easy access to drugs, and yet it is evidently heretical to state that relationship out loud. that's even more remarkable when the increased use and abuse of painkillers is universally acknowledged as a major element of the opioid crisis.\n\nno one seems to have trouble acknowledging that fact when blaming pharmaceutical companies for creating and pushing drugs, doctors for over-prescribing them, or americans for reporting remarkably high levels of pain and demanding truckloads of pills to deal with it. the senate report itself states at the very beginning that the opioid epidemic is complicated, and most agree that development, marketing, and medical training regarding drug usage – and the resulting over-prescription of opioids – have played a key role.\n\nask if a massive government program that makes it much easier for over one-fifth of the population to get drugs could be part of the problem, however, and you're a hyper-partisan monster who really just wants to kill poor people by taking away their obamacare. the senate committee demonstrated its understanding of just how hot this political potato is by filling the early pages of the report with lavish praise for medicaid and its good intentions, and repeatedly stating that government spending on drugs is but one factor in a complex crisis that deserves careful analysis.\n\nthe report studied hundreds of cases in which medicaid was abused and defrauded to obtain opioids that were often resold on the streets. the report quotes sam quinones' award-winning book dreamland: the true tale of america's opiate epidemic to explain why this outcome was entirely predictable: we can talk morality all day long, but if you're drawing five hundred dollars a month and you have a medicaid card that allows you to get a monthly supply of pills worth several thousand dollars, you're going to sell your pills.\n\nsome of the fraud cases detailed in the report go far beyond individual beneficiaries making the sort of calculation quinones described. some of them were organized conspiracies involving large numbers of medicaid beneficiaries recruited to provide inventory to drug dealers. the largest scheme chronicled in the report saw over a billion dollars change hands.\n\na police officer quoted in the report observed that pharmacists are more likely to fill dubious prescriptions when medicaid is involved. the justice department launched a program over the summer to study the role played real and fraudulent prescriptions for opioids in the drug crisis.\n\nthe senate homeland security report further notes that medicaid fraud is rampant and has not been handled effectively by the government, a fact known to any serious student of the waste, fraud, and abuse that politicians of both parties vow to crack down upon during every election.\n\nother fraud-susceptible programs such as medicare, the va, and the food stamp program are duly cited by the report as sources of opioids.\n\n(yes, the food stamp program. among other things, it is well-known to investigators that some snap card holders engage in trafficking of their benefits, and often purchase drugs with the money they receive. this has been specifically cited as a contributing factor to the opioid crisis. also, shop owners have been prosecuted for allowing customers to use snap benefits to pay directly for forbidden items. one such case documented in the senate report involved a small grocery store with a back-room stash of medicaid-funded oxycontin pills.)\n\nthe research suggests, however, that medicaid is the federal program most prone to abuse, and the primary government funding source for the epidemic, the authors point out.\n\nthere appears to be no limit to the types of schemes used to scam the medicaid program, from large drug rings that employ beneficiaries as 'runners' to fill oxycodone prescriptions, to nurses working the night shift who steal hydrocodone pills from patients. illicit painkillers obtained with medicaid cards are being resold at handsome profits nationwide, in places ranging from the streets of milwaukee to a native american reservation in upstate new york, says the report.\n\nanother problem is the illicit use of drugs intended to treat drug addiction, notably suboxone. the attorney general of kentucky is quoted declaring that wrongful prescribing of suboxone is flooding our communities with yet another drug that is killing our children.\n\nit's not just illicit street purchases increasing in tandem with medicaid expansion. national review points to centers for disease control data that opioid prescribing rates among medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance. in washington state, the cdc found that medicaid beneficiaries were 5.7 times more likely to die of opioid-related causes.\n\nthe most provocative section of the report introduces facts and figures to buttress the argument that opioid abuse has grown worse in states that expanded medicaid under obamacare.\n\nmore than 80 percent of the 298 separate medicaid-opioids cases identified were filed in medicaid expansion states, led by new york, michigan, louisiana, new jersey, and ohio, the report states. the number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after the medicaid expansion, from 2014 to 2017, compared to the four-year period before expansion.\n\nit is further noted that drug overdose deaths are increasing almost twice as fast in expansion states, hospital stays for opioid-related issues massively spiked after expansion, and medicaid spending for drug abuse treatment is rising faster in expansion states.\n\nconversely, as investors business daily notes, eight of the 15 states with the lowest overdose rates did not expand medicaid. all of these observations should be considered with the usual caveat that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation – there are almost certainly other factors common to expansion states that help to explain their rising addiction rates, although the dramatic increase immediately after the expansion is not easily dismissed.\n\nthese assertions are based on official figures that most analysts agree are significantly under-stating the depths of the opioid crisis. one specialist quoted in the senate report said the opioid epidemic is deadlier than the aids epidemic at its peak.\n\nreviewing the senate homeland security report for forbes, sally pipes notes that state medicaid expansion had the perverse effect of enrolling able-bodied, childless adults in their medicaid programs than it does for children and the destitute elderly. able-bodied childless adults are also the group experiencing an anomalous increase in mortality rates, which in turn is believed to be strongly influenced by opioid addiction.\n\nabout 80 percent of heroin and fentanyl users spiraled into their addictions after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers. the medicaid expansion made those painkillers widely and cheaply available, pipes notes, succinctly stating the point nobody is supposed to make.\n\nshe also tackles the bizarre argument that medicaid is a net plus because it treats more drug addicts than it creates, which is the sort of argument that only makes sense to people whose capacity for reason has been eroded by decades of worshipping big government. (try this argument for comparison purposes: tobacco companies are a net plus for public health because they provide so much funding to treat smoking-related illnesses.)\n\npipes suggests addressing the crisis by rolling back the medicaid expansion and block-granting funds to states, which could help to drain the bureaucratic swamp that hides so much medicaid corruption and strongly incentivize states to watch their health-care dollars more carefully.\n\nsuch suggestions run strongly against the current political tides, with democrats pushing hard for even more centralized political control of medicine and ever-larger bureaucracies, with an eye toward midwifing the birth of the doomsday bureaucratic monstrosity known as single-payer socialized medicine. imagine how bad the opioid crisis will get if everyone gets medicaid.\n\nbut of course, you're not supposed to imagine that, much less conduct hard research into any aspect of the absolutely forbidden notion that government makes problems worse by subsidizing them.
the donald trump administration released a new rule to offer americans more affordable, short-term health insurance options compared to obamacare.\n\non wednesday, the departments of health and humans services (hhs), labor, and treasury released a final rule that expands short-term, limited-duration health insurance from their previous maximum period of three months. under the new rule, a short-term health insurance plan can cover a patient for up to a year and can even be extended to a maximum three years.\n\nthe trump administration will help americans have more affordable health insurance options compared to the skyrocketing premiums and diminishing options on the individual insurance market.\n\nhhs secretary alex azar said in a statement on wednesday:\n\nunder the affordable care act, americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle. president trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market, including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. these plans aren't for everyone, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.\n\nthe centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) released a report in july that average obamacare monthly premiums by 27 percent in 2018, which was even higher than 2017's 21 percent rate hike.\n\namericans who do not receive obamacare individual premium subsidies would benefit the most from expanded short-term insurance plans. in plan year 2017, which began in november 2016, there was a 20 percent drop in those who enrolled in obamacare without affordable care act (aca) without obamacare subsidies. in six states, unsubsidized obamacare enrollment dropped by more than 40 percent, including a 73 percent drop in arizona.\n\ncato institute health scholar michael cannon suggested that short-term health plans could cost 90 percent less than obamacare plans.\n\nwe continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market, especially for those who don't qualify for large subsidies, said cms administrator seema verma in a statement on wednesday. this final rule opens the door to new, more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class americans who have been priced out of aca plans.\n\nthe hhs contends that short-term insurance plans can help americans between insurance options, such as those between jobs, a student time off from school, or even middle-class families without access to subsidized obamacare plans.\n\nshort-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with onerous obamacare insurance regulations, meaning that short-term insurance plan premiums can cost a third of the cost compared to obamacare plans. the average monthly premium for a short-term insurance plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized obamacare plan costs $393 per month.\n\npresident donald trump signed an executive order last october which expanded short-term insurance plans as well as association health plans (ahps).\n\nsen. rand paul (r-ky) lauded the expansion of ahps and short-term health insurance as the biggest free-market health care reform in a generation.
a hospitalized supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg participated in wednesday's court arguments by teleconference one day after receiving non-surgical treatment.\n\nginsburg spoke from her hospital bed at johns hopkins university as the high court heard arguments regarding obamacare's requirement that women be provided access to no-cost contraceptives.\n\non tuesday evening, the supreme court said ginsburg underwent a procedure to treat a benign gallbladder condition earlier in the day and was resting comfortably.\n\njustice ruth bader ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore, maryland, the supreme court said in a statement. following oral arguments on monday, the justice underwent outpatient tests at sibley memorial hospital in washington, d.c., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. the justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. she expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.\n\nin late november, ginsburg was hospitalized at johns hopkins hospital for two nights with the chills and a fever.\n\nginsburg — often referred to as the notorious rbg in democrat circles — has had multiple health issues in recent years. the justice broke three of her ribs in a fall in november 2018 and underwent lung cancer surgery in december 2018. she received radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in august.\n\nginsburg has also survived colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.\n\ndespite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to leave the bench.\n\npresident jimmy carter appointed ginsburg to the u.s. court of appeals in 1980 and president bill clinton appointed her to the supreme court in 1993.
the house freedom caucus announced after a wednesday lunch meeting with sen. rand paul (r.-ky) that it has 25 hard-no votes, enough to defeat the american health care act crafted and promoted by speaker paul ryan (r.-wi) as a rescue for insurance companies caught in the obamacare death spiral.\n\npaul said the sooner the house republican leadership disposes with the ryancare bill, the sooner leadership can get together with capitol hill conservatives to draft a bill that repeals and replaces the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act, which created obamacare.\n\nthere is no other way to go than for the speaker and his team to start over, paul said. they are going to have to, they don't have the votes.\n\npaul, who ran against donald trump in the republican primaries, told reporters the defeat of ryan's insurance industry rescue bill is not a defeat for trump.\n\ni commend @freedomcaucus for staying united against obamacare lite. enough no votes to stop bill and restart negotiations w/ conservatives — senator rand paul (@randpaul) march 22, 2017\n\nthis is really a defeat for paul ryan, he said. ryan is going to have to come to conservatives now and ask for the votes he doesn't have–if he has the votes, he doesn't have to–but he is going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.\n\nthe chairman of the house freedom caucus rep. mark meadows (r.-nc) said ryan does not have the votes to pass ryancare if house republican leadership insists on bringing the bill to the floor thursday. there are not enough votes to pass it tomorrow.\n\nmembers of the freedom caucus met with vice president mike pence before their meeting with paul, and nothing pence said changed the caucus's determination to oppose any health care reform bill that does not end the individual mandate and the essential benefits provisions of obamacare. meadows said, we had a really good conversation. i am not going to comment on private conversations.\n\nmeadows said he is not persuaded by potential changes to the ryancare bill in the senate if it passes the house.\n\ni serve in the house and the only vote that i can be worried about is the vote that i have to take in the house tomorrow, he said.\n\nthe scene in the normally quiet hallways of rayburn house office building was a raucous mashup of print and broadcast reporters, still cameras and video cameras, boom microphones, cell phones on voice recorder apps, and bright lights. as the lawmakers made their way in and out of room 2247, the media mob slowly moved in front and behind.\n\nin the scrum surrounding senator paul, a female producer for cnn was knocked to the ground, and the senator immediately stopped answering questions and helped the young woman back to her feet. once she appeared to be standing on her own two feet, the barrage of questions started up again.\n\nthe meeting ended because alarms went off warning members that they needed to vote on the house floor. meadows and the previous hfc chairman rep. jim jordan (r.-oh) broke through the reporters and cameramen to reach the elevators–only to have the doors open in front of them for a carriage going up. frustrated, meadows turned to answer more questions as the passengers in the elevator had a front row view before the doors closed again.\n\nwhen the bell went off for another elevator, the two men made for it. hold on, i am like a trapped rabbit–i gotta get through, meadows said.\n\nbefore the doors closed, breitbart news asked meadows how many no-votes were in the elevator. after giving a quick look to jordan and the three other passengers, he replied, four.\n\njordan added, plenty.
preventing welfare-dependent legal immigrants from permanently resettling in the united states and eventually becoming u.s. citizens would help out the american taxpayer, an expert tells siriusxm's breitbart news daily.\n\nin an interview with breitbart news deputy political editor amanda house, rj hauman with the federation for american immigration reform (fair) said president trump's plan to keep foreign nationals who rely on welfare from permanently resettling in the u.s. would be one step in creating an immigration system that works in the national interest.\n\nhauman said:\n\nnow when these legal immigrants come in [to the u.s.] and potentially get a green card or citizenship, the american taxpayer is expected to bear the brunt of allowing them to immigrate here. they're allowed to use medicaid, obamacare subsidies, and a whole host of other programs that we foot the bill for. [emphasis added] the question is, why has the government — down the line — when did they get rid of this common sense approach… the administration is just trying to restore the integrity of our immigration system and help out the american taxpayer. [emphasis added]\n\nhauman also slammed the establishment media's coverage of the plan — which could be rolled out in the coming weeks — as out of touch and not based in history.\n\nthis isn't some radical new change, hauman said. public charge doctrine has existed in the country since 1882, the immigration act of 1882, which gave the government the ability to restrict entry of any person who is unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.\n\nbut then, somewhere along the line, the likelihood of an individual becoming a public charge is hardly ever even considered anymore in the immigration process, hauman continued.\n\nlisten to the full interview here:\n\n\n\nsuch a plan would be a boon for american taxpayers, who currently spend about $57.4 billion a year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low skilled legal immigrants every year.\n\na recent breitbart news report also revealed that more than half of the foreign refugee households resettled permanently in the u.s. between 2011 and 2015 were on food stamps. the trump administration has sought to reduce the burden of mass immigration to benefit the wages and quality of life of america's working and middle class.\n\nabout 62 percent of american voters have said that they support a plan to prevent immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded welfare.\n\nmass legal and illegal immigration to the u.s. continues to be the largest driver of population increases and demographic shifts in the country. every year, more than 1.5 million immigrants are admitted to the country. the u.s. has imported more than ten million immigrants in the last decade.\n\njohn binder is a reporter for breitbart news. follow him on twitter at @jxhnbinder.
on wednesday's broadcast of the fox news channel's fox news @ night, house freedom caucus member louie gohmert (r-tx) reacted to the omnibus bill by stating this is really tragic, and this is a rather dark day.\n\ngohmert said, this is really tragic, a massive spending bill. and the truth is, the house did our job. we passed 12 appropriations bills. we had a budget. and the senate didn't do their job. it doesn't appear they're ever going to until number one, we get rid of the cloture, the 60 vote requirement and go with 51. … president trump's been great on that. and then — and by the way, the constitution only requires a majority. that was a super-imposition by the senate.\n\nhe added that the house should signal to the senate that it won't pass another omnibus or cr.\n\nhe further stated that the omnibus is good for democrats, and they got their priorities in there, and we didn't. he also stated he had a lot more time to read obamacare than the current omnibus.\n\ngohmert concluded, this is a rather dark day.\n\nfollow ian hanchett on twitter @ianhanchett
rep. paul gosar (r-az) says the republican leadership in congress should be prioritizing american citizens by supporting his legislation to clarify that criminal foreigners are eligible for deportation out of the united states.\n\nin an interview with siriusxm's breitbart news tonight, gosar told breitbart news senior editor-at-large, rebecca mansour, that his latest legislation, the criminal alien removal clarification act, should be part of a strategy by the gop leadership, headed by house speaker paul ryan.\n\nmansour: is it going to be on the floor for a vote anytime soon? gosar: well, you know, that's always the worry that you have is that what does leadership think? and that should be part of a strategy that leadership puts on the floor, but you never know what they're thinking.\n\ngosar introduced his legislation to address a loophole identified in supreme court justice neil gorsuch's recent ruling in sessions v. dimaya where he said a clause in federal law allowing for the deportation of foreigners found guilty of a crime of violence is unconstitutional because it is overly vague.\n\nthis is a winner. this is simple, this is a no-brainer, mansour said. and let's make it an issue. and if the democrats want to vote against [deporting criminal foreigners], let's please get them on the record before the midterms. i would love, i'm sure everybody that's running for congress this year or running to hold their seat, would love, love to make an advertisement, to make a campaign commercial noting if their democrat opponent does not want to vote 'yes' on [deporting criminal foreigners].\n\nlisten to gosar's full interview with breitbart news tonight here:\n\nunder gosar's legislation, which already has 28 co-sponsors, foreign nationals living in the u.s. would be eligible for deportation if they are convicted of a felony or have two or more misdemeanors on their record.\n\nthe language is simple, satisfies constitutional scrutiny, avoids loopholes, and gives codified guidance to the doj and homeland security in order to remove non-citizens who break our laws, a statement from gosar's office says of the bill.\n\ngosar said, it makes absolute, perfect sense for the gop leadership to start coalescing support from americans and members of congress for his anti-illegal immigration legislation.\n\nit's very simple, you know it's not wordy, gosar told breitbart news. it's to the point and it prioritizes american citizens.\n\ngosar also told breitbart news that republican voters ahead of the midterms have reason to be unsatisfied with their members of congress, but says his anti-illegal immigration legislation can bring public support to pro-america first candidates as immigration remains gop voters' biggest issue.\n\ngosar: there are some pretenses there. this is a way, especially when you have the speaker now acknowledging that there's, we've got some problems that we're running into headwinds. and you know those headwinds, if you talk to people on the street, is that 'trust is a series of promises kept. please tell us how you kept your promises. you said you were going to repeal and replace obamacare, you didn't. you said that you were going to build a wall, you haven't and you failed to even put money there for the president to do it. and then you've consistently beat down the american public by putting omnibus bills that go into deficit spending like $1.3 trillion and then give really the concerted effort and gavel of the spending to nancy pelosi, chuck schumer, to california to new york, who are never going to vote for you.' so from that standpoint, here's something that's a goodwill gesture to get the american people believing that congress actually does represent the people and it starts in the peoples' house.\n\nas breitbart news reported, 47 and 40 percent of gop voters respectively say immigration and national security are the leading issues in their opinion. meanwhile, only 11 percent of gop voters said taxes were the most important issue in the country, ranking lower than more obscure issues like school safety and defense spending.\n\nfor the midterms, trump has refused to sign onto the campaign-on-taxes midterm plan, instead, sticking to his populist immigration and trade agenda in recent campaign speeches.\n\nbreitbart news tonight airs monday through friday on siriusxm's patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. pacific).
president donald trump criticized mike bloomberg on monday after the former mayor ran ads against the president for his record on health care.\n\nmini mike bloomberg is spending a lot of money on false advertising, trump wrote on twitter.\n\nbloomberg is spending millions running ads that attack trump for wanting to repeal obamacare:\n\nbloomberg is running the same tactics that helped democrats successfully win the house of representatives in 2018 — threatening that republicans' attempt to repeal obamacare would remove healthcare coverage for preexisting conditions.\n\nrepublicans say, however, that if obamacare were repealed, it would be replaced by a better plan that would still cover preexisting conditions.\n\npresident trump claimed that he saved coverage for preexisting conditions while working to get rid of the individual mandate requiring all americans to get health insurance or pay a fine.\n\nthe senate's attempt to pass a repeal of obamacare blew up after late sen. john mccain voted to prevent it from going to conference.\n\ntrump has repeatedly pressed republicans for a better healthcare plan but has so far promised a better plan if republicans win big in 2020.\n\nobamacare itself faces a supreme court ruling on its constitutionality.\n\nif republicans win in court and take back the house of represenatives [sic], your healthcare, that i have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far, he wrote.\n\ntrump again vowed to protect preexisting conditions if reelected in 2020.\n\ni will always protect your pre-existing conditions, he wrote. the dems will not!\n\nbloomberg told reporters saturday that he will spend up to a billion dollars to defeat trump in 2020, even if he does not win the democrat primary.\n\nnumber one priority is to get rid of donald trump. i'm spending all my money to get rid of trump, he said:
top trump administration officials indicated that while the president still backs repealing the obamacare individual mandate, the administration would accept a tax reform package that left the mandate in place.\n\nwhite house budget director mick mulvaney said sunday the white house would be okay with dropping the repeal from the senate plan. the house bill passed last week did not include the repeal of the mandate.\n\nif we can repeal part of obamacare as part of a tax bill, and have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that's great, mulvaney said in a cnn interview. if it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we're okay with taking it out. so i think it is up to the house and the senate to hammer out those details.\n\ntreasury secretary steve mnuchin said on fox that while president trump doesn't regard the mandate as a bargaining chip in the tax negotiations, the overall goal of passing tax reform would take priority.\n\nthis is all about getting this passed in the senate, that's the objective, mnuchin said. this isn't a bargaining chip. the president thinks we should get rid of it. i think we should get rid of it.\n\nmnuchin and mulvaney were reacting to comments by senator susan collins (r-maine) who said she has concerns over repealing the mandate. on sunday, she said in an interview with abc that including the repeal in the senate version was a big mistake.\n\ni hope it will be dropped, she said.\n\ncollins has also said she would favor cutting back the size of the corporate tax cut so that the rate would fall from 35 percent to 22 percent, instead of the 20 percent in the current house and senate bill. she would then use the additional revenue to pay for keeping in place the deductions for state and local taxes.\n\ncollins, however, has also said she still has objections to the mandate itself. she declined to say whether she would oppose the bill when it comes up for a vote in the senate, likely after thanksgiving.
the right track/wrong track numbers are the best we've seen since february of 2017, reports rasmussen polling, and well above the dismal numbers that defined the last year of barack obama's failed presidency.\n\ncurrently, the rasmussen weekly poll of 2,500 likely voters shows that 45 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction, while 51 percent say we are headed in the wrong direction.\n\nthe previous week, the right track number was 40 percent, while the wrong track sat at 55 percent.\n\nso what we have here is the best showing for this number, in this particular poll, in three years.\n\nthe good folks over at realclearpolitics (rcp) also keep track of this number in their poll of polls. as of now, the rcp average is that 39 percent see us on the right track, while 54 percent say the wrong track. that's a 15 point spread.\n\ngranted, that is a much wider spread than rasmussen, but the average of that number in the rcp poll of polls has been steadily improving since october of 2017, when the spread was 36 points — 28 percent right track, 64 percent wrong.\n\nwhat's more, if you look at the right/track wrong track numbers throughout obama's presidency, except for the very beginning of his hopey/changey administration, and a very short time in december of 2012, the right track/wrong track number was much, much wider during his eight years — we're talking about a steady 25 to 35 percent gap.\n\nthere is just no question that under trump, more people are satisfied with the direction of the country.\n\nand why wouldn't they be?\n\nalthough the fake new media have spent three years attempting to sow discord and disruption with their various anti-trump hoaxes (russia collusion, hate crimes, ukraine, etc.), thanks in large part to trump's policies abroad and at home we are, for the first time since september 11, 2001, enjoying an era of real peace and prosperity.\n\nobama's stupid economic policies — higher taxes and the looming threat of even higher ones, over-regulation, the obamacare boondoggle, and all the uncertainty — put a boot on the throat of what should have been a robust recovery after the 2008 recession. overseas, obama was unsure (syria) or stupidly interventionalist (libya) while allowing isis to flourish.\n\nand let's not forget the non-stop anxiety with our southern border constantly under siege by waves and waves of illegal immigrants, a problem trump is a long way from solving, but thanks to his diplomatic work with mexico and the border wall, this is also improving.\n\nso far, trump has beautifully managed foreign policy in a way that has not only kept us out of foreign entanglements, he's also tamped down aggressors such as north korea and iran. and let's not forget how he whupped isis or how he solved an ancient border dispute between syria and turkey while the fake news media were yelling about a coming kurd holocaust and world war iii.\n\non top of that, the economy is booming: jobs are being created, real wages are up for the first time in decades, energy prices are low, and the trump policies that have made us energy independent have ensured no spike in pump costs when things go sideways overseas — such as this recent dust up with iran. honestly, you cannot overestimate how this kind of stability affects people's peace of mind.\n\ngoing back to 2015, i've kept a close eye on the right track/wrong track numbers. the gap in these numbers over the previous ten years, reaching all the way back to george w. bush's presidency, told me people were desperate for change, and that 2016 could not be a match-up between jeb bush and hillary clinton (as the experts predicted). people desperately wanted something new. why would they go back to clinton and bush?\n\nwell, i was wrong about clinton. hideous hillary won the primary, but bernie did give her a helluva run, and bernie is a 485-year-old marxist. how's that for change?\n\nin the gop 2016 field, though, republicans chose the least-conventional candidate of my lifetime, and it paid off with a white house win. regardless of how people feel about trump personally, the right track/wrong track numbers show a stable sense of satisfaction with the way things are going for the first time some 15 years.\n\nthat's a big deal.\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
president donald trump has fortified his white house with a new chief of staff, former house freedom caucus chairman and retiring rep. mark meadows (r-nc).\n\non friday night, the president named meadows his new incoming white house chief of staff, announcing that his acting chief of staff mick mulvaney would become the new special envoy to northern ireland.\n\ni am pleased to announce that congressman mark meadows will become white house chief of staff. i have long known and worked with mark, and the relationship is a very good one…. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 7, 2020\n\n….i want to thank acting chief mick mulvaney for having served the administration so well. he will become the united states special envoy for northern ireland. thank you! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 7, 2020\n\nmeadows served as the second chairman of the house freedom caucus, taking the reins from the group's founder and his close ally, rep. jim jordan (r-oh). together, meadows and jordan have been a pair of the president's fiercest defenders in the house, but even before president trump's 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western north carolina has helped pave the future path of the republican party—pulling the gop away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate.\n\nmeadows' success in congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of trump allies on friday evening telling breitbart news that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign.\n\ncongressman meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the maga movement for years now, donald trump, jr., president trump's eldest son, told breitbart news. there are some major battles ahead and i can't think of anyone more equipped to fight alongside the president for the future of our country.\n\nmeadows is cut from the same cloth as the president; he's a fighter and will do what it takes to win, cliff sims, a former trump white house official and outside ally of the president, added. he's the perfect choice to lead the white house staff through election season. a brilliant choice by president trump.\n\nmark has great political instincts and, to put it bluntly, is just a total killer, andy surabian, a gop strategist and also a former white house official, added. he's exactly who president trump needs by his side in an election year.\n\nmark being chief of staff is a massive win for the maga movement, charlie kirk, the founder and president of turning point usa, told breitbart news.\n\nmark meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as president trump's chief of staff, rep. louie gohmert (r-tx) told breitbart news as well. after enduring establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the president will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.\n\nmeadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a motion to vacate the chair in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-speaker john boehner would be allowed to remain in his position.\n\nwhen meadows did it, most of the washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow house freedom caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by september 2015 to knock out boehner. when boehner realized meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the house in order to avoid embarrassment.\n\nwhile most of the rest of the media ignored him, breitbart news traveled to his district that august recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change congress for the better by removing someone who, as speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former president barack obama that left the country worse off.\n\nin the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western north carolina, meadows explained how so many people come to washington, dc, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different.\n\ni think everybody starts out doing that, because they're real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, 'golly, i want to be a voice for the people,' meadows said when asked if enough members of congress listen to their constituents.\n\nthe longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. for me, i've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in washington, d.c., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? there are some of them that have been difficult for me. a prime example is on the syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade syria or not? i had my own personal view, the fact i believed that isis was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. i was war weary, but i felt like we needed to do that. my district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, 'we don't want you to do that.' we're tired of wars. it shifted where we were to saying, just listen, the people back home… and it wasn't just republicans. it was democrats, independents, everyone. for us, it's just about trying to have an open ea, then going to washington, d.c., and voting the way the people here want you to vote. when you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in washington, d.c., or 'the practical thing to do,' but i try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time i come back – especially if it's for a week or longer where i'm just listening to people. both the good and the bad. we're going to continue to try to get better, meadows said.\n\nlisten to his constituents he certainly did. after he toppled boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—meadows soon after became the chairman of the house freedom caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder jim jordan. meadows weaponized the freedom caucus, leveraging the group's approximately 40 members in the gop majority for the last year plus of obama's administration and for the first two years of trump's first term to steer the party away from now former speaker paul ryan's failed visions for republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration.\n\nsupporters of meadows say that they should expect trump's new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists.\n\nfinally, a chief of staff that respects the trump supporters who put him in the white house, j. christian adams, president of the public interest legal foundation, told breitbart news.\n\nmany members of meadows' freedom caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. of course, mulvaney is the outgoing acting white house chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of office of management and budget (omb) under trump. but he was one of meadows's allies and fellow freedom caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. florida gov. ron desantis, a republican who's currently america's most popular governor, was a freedom caucus member when he served in the house. former rep. cynthia lummis (r-wy), now the frontrunner for u.s. senate in wyoming, was a freedom caucus member too.\n\nanother former freedom caucus member, former rep. dave brat (r-va), now works at liberty university leading efforts to expose chinese communists. he told breitbart news on friday night that meadows is an excellent choice for trump to lead the white house staff.\n\ni think meadows loves the american people as president trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute president trump's agenda and make america great again, brat said.\n\nwhen ryan was pushing president trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an obamacare replacement that critics derisively called ryancare—the deal fell apart, a ryan failure that hurt trump in his first few months as president. meadows, working with republican members like now former rep. tom macarthur (r-nj), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured house passage of the gop healthcare plan.\n\nit was later doomed in the senate by the late sen. john mccain (r-az), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the senate as he voted against it. but it would have stopped in the house after ryan's failure had it not been for meadows' work to save the president's push for a better healthcare vision for the country than obamacare.\n\nhealthcare was not the only major policy fight in which meadows helped president trump against leftist democrats and establishment republicans. on everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the trump tax cuts and more, meadows has been one of trump's go-to allies in the house since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular.\n\nmeadows was also critical in helping trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president's acquittal by the u.s. senate after the democrat-led house impeached him. a member of the president's team of house members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, meadows was critical in securing the president's position and holding back the plotters. the coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming russian collusion with trump's 2016 campaign that eventually led to the special counsel robert mueller's investigation that cleared trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the ukraine front.\n\nthe ukiraine accusations led to the house impeachment effort and, finally, the president's acquittal. every step of the way, meadows was at trump's side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take trump down.\n\nfor all of these reasons and more, meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. freedomworks vice president noah wall told breitbart news that his group could not be happier with the choice trump made here.\n\nfreedomworks could not be more proud that the former house freedom caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support president trump through this critical election year, wall said.\n\nrick manning, the president of americans for limited government, added that mick mulvaney did a great job of leading the white house through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the president as omb director and the head of the cfpb.\n\nhe will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help northern ireland transition through the difficulties of brexit, manning said.\n\nbut meadows, manning added, is a fighter who has the president's trust.
an editor at the left-wing website vox is rallying to the defense of political newcomer and self-described democratic socialist alexandria ocasio-cortez because the congressional candidate is facing gender discrimination.\n\ncalling ocasio-cortez an emerging democratic star, laura mcgann wrote that she and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) share a lot in common — except for the reaction they receive from political movers and shakers:\n\nsanders and ocasio-cortez are both self-described democratic socialists. they both energize the left. and they both rocketed out of obscurity to the center of the political debate. but there's a difference in how the washington establishment treats them. sanders skeptics attack his ideas; they challenge him. ocasio-cortez's critics not only critique her words but question whether she should have a voice in the public debate at all. this is a person not ready for prime time, certainly not ready for congress, the ever-quoted voice of the washington establishment norm ornstein tweeted in response to her answer on a question about israel. she should stop campaigning & do a crash course on basics, including economics and foreign policy. otherwise, she will stumble badly out of the blocks and do major damage. early impressions hard to erase.\n\nornstein was referring to ocasio-cortez's bizarre remarks about israel in a pbs interview in july after her unexpected win over democratic party caucus chair rep. joe crowley (d-ny) in that state's primary election.\n\ni also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where i tend to come from on this issue, ocasio-cortez said.\n\nmcgann also criticized daily beast writer matt lewis, who called ocasio-cortez the telegenic it girl of the left.\n\nyou have the potential for a very bright future, lewis said. don't blow it. take your time. avoid overexposure. bone up on the issues. do the hard work. there's no reason to be in a rush.\n\nocasio-cortez pulled off an incredible political achievement, she's been courted by candidates nationwide who want her endorsement, and her résumé stacks up against the men her age in congress — but that's not good enough, mcgann opined.\n\nmcgann claimed that research shows again and again that women face a higher standard for being successful on the job and in politics.\n\nin a town where male politicians are allowed to get policy facts wrong without losing credibility, ocasio-cortez's mistakes are held up as evidence that she's not up to the task, mcgann wrote.\n\nmcgann even called out washington post columnist glenn kessler for pointing out how some of her statements since arriving in the spotlight have been false, including calling the premium for an obamacare policy a tax.\n\nbut mcgann dismissed this and other mistakes because many politicians do the same.\n\nshe cited mistakes politifact claimed to uncover in house speaker paul ryan's remarks, then implied ocasio-cortez could face discrimination because of her latino heritage.\n\nthis isn't an argument to hold members of congress to a lower standard, mcgann wrote. we should scrutinize their ideas and their plans and question whether they should represent us.\n\nbut we shouldn't use that standard for some candidates like ocasio-cortez and give a pass to men who we think look the part of a politician, like tall, blue-eyed paul ryan.\n\nmcgann also cites studies that show males may be preferred hires because of perceived competence and that women are underrepresented on corporate boards.\n\nmcgann uses sources, including a colleague, to bolster her claim that women can even outperform their male counterparts and are more likely to pass legislation that is more favorable to women.\n\nmcgann cites ocasio's degree in economics from boston college, her time campaigning for sanders' presidential campaign, and even her job as a bartender and server as experiences that may benefit her political ambitions.\n\nmcgann concludes that more women, in general, should be elected to congress and should not face discrimination in the process or in the process of getting any job.\n\nwe have to acknowledge what happens to women in leadership positions across fields, mcgann said. they face bias that holds them back. and it's holding the country back too.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter.
rep. dave brat (r-va), a member of the house freedom caucus, told breitbart news daily on thursday that newly tapped national economic council chairman larry kudlow is going to be a breath of fresh air in the white house.\n\npresident donald trump announced on wednesday that he picked former ronald reagan economist and longtime cnbc commentator larry kudlow as his chief economic adviser and director of the national economic council.\n\nlarry kudlow was offered, and accepted, the position of assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the national economic council, sarah huckabee sanders said in a statement.\n\ncongressman brat told breitbart news daily, on kudlow, this guy is going to be phenomenal. i think he's super. he goes back to the reagan era. he ran the omb, the office of management and budget. he's a total free-marketeer. he's familiar with everything: reagan politics, free-market economics, wall street, tv host, and everybody likes him. democrats like him. republicans like him. but he doesn't shrink back from his message.\n\nbrat continued, he knows better than anyone that the performance coming out of free-markets and letting individuals alone and not encumbering them with unending regulations is going to serve us all better in short and the long run. he put together the tax bill way back when, and now, he's got a slot in the there. he's going to be a total breath of fresh air.\n\nbreitbart news daily host amanda house then asked rep. brat why congress cannot pass any significant gun legislation, such as national reciprocity. brat blames the senate.\n\nbrat explained why the senate cannot pass any significant legislation: we passed that a couple months ago. the senate is the issue on everything. the senate bombed on health care. the senate bombs on everything. that's where everything goes to die. we could if we use budget reconciliation and pass something with 51 votes, but this year, i don't know if people know, but the senate did not put that in the budget; we gave up our only ability to pass legislation as republicans. so we gave up budget reconciliation unilaterally.\n\nthe republicans gave up power for no reason, the virginia republican added.\n\ncongressman brat then discussed the upcoming 2018 midterms and charged that republicans need to focus on core issues to win.\n\nbrat suggested, we have to get back to our basic issues. they will lose on the basic issues. obamacare is still the law of the land. the promise was that you can keep your doctor [and that] prices will stay down. none of that was true. we need to get back to our pillars.\n\nthe democrats are going to kick in with the politics of personal destruction. it's just name-calling, brat stated.\n\nbreitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. eastern.\n\nlisten:
former vice president joe biden and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) released the policy recommendations of their unity task force on wednesday.\n\nthe proposed platform marks biden's continued shift to the left, as the so-called moderate candidate — a label he has rejected — continues to be steered toward more radical positions to appeal to the party's base, offering revolutionary institutional changes.\n\nhere are nine of the most radical proposals in the unity document:\n\n1. rejoin the paris climate agreement … on day one. even many on the left agree that the paris climate agreement does little to slow climate change. it is a symbolic commitment by the rest of the world to reduce emissions, while most of the burden falls on the united states. our economy has reduced emissions anyway on its own, thanks to the shift to natural gas and the advent of fracking technology, which the left hates and wants to phase out over time.\n\n2. shift the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to american-made, zero-emission alternatives in five years. this is among the more wild-eyed proposals in the platform's climate change section. it is not clear who will produce these buses (presumably to run on battery power), or what is to be done with half a million currently functional buses that run on ordinary fuel, and how local school districts are meant to afford the cost. the platform provides no further details.\n\n3. end cash bail. the platform calls for eliminating cash bail across the country — a radical experiment in criminal justice reform that has only just begun in california and new york, with results that are deeply concerning. the idea is to reduce inequities, but in practice the end of cash bail means releasing violent criminals to commit more crimes. one suspect in antisemitic attacks in new york city late last year, for example, was repeatedly re-arrested after her releases.\n\n4. stop the practice of arresting children for behavior that ought to be handled in the principal's office. the democrats want to stop what they call the school-to-prison pipeline, arguing students of color suffer disproportionate suspensions and arrests (which would mean that liberal teachers are racist). but as andrew pollack points out, failing to arrest violent children could allow them to buy guns as adults, which is how the parkland, florida, shooting happened.\n\n5. we will repeal so-called 'right to work' laws. it is not clear how democrats will actually do this, since these laws are made at the state level. but right to work laws — freeing employees from being forced to join unions — have been a huge economic boost to states that have adopted them. working-class americans — especially minorities — have voted with their feet, moving from the highly unionized rust belt to the right to work south, where there are more jobs.\n\n6. democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via so-called 'card check' processes. the card check violates the right to a secret ballot, and allows organizers to intimidate workers into voting to certify unions. the idea is so radical that even george mcgovern, the left-wing democratic presidential nominee in 1972 who lost to president richard nixon in a landslide, came out against it the last time democrats tried to mandate it, in 2009.\n\n7. oppose private school vouchers. there is growing support for school vouchers that allow students to escape failing public schools in their local districts by choosing alternative schools — including private and religious schools. vouchers are especially popular with minority families, who are desperate to escape the failing system in which the teachers' unions have trapped their children. democrats also want to restrict the expansion of charter schools, too.\n\n8. provide a public option toward universal health care. this idea was so radical ten years ago that democrats left it out of obamacare. but it is the beginning of medicare for all, which sanders wants to impose on everyone, and biden wants to offer as a choice (for now). there is no thought of achieving universal health care outside government, building on the recent reforms under the trump administration, such as tele-medicine — just more federal bureaucracy.\n\n9. end the border wall and provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers. a biden administration would stop the construction of the unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective wall on the southern border — thus allowing an open border — while also giving voting citizenship to the eleven million-plus illegal aliens who are already here, permanently changing the american electorate and enshrining democrats in power forever.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at

another major american healthcare provider is signaling that it is likely to pull out of the obamacare markets in 2018 if its financial position continues to deteriorate.\n\nanthem inc. is poised to join unitedhealth group inc., aetna inc., and humana inc. in pulling out of its participation in the affordable care act (aca), often called obamacare. these giant healthcare companies have suffered massive losses under the law.\n\nif we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018, anthem chief executive officer joseph swedish said, according to bloomberg. clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.\n\nif anthem withdraws from obamacare, it could affect the coverage of about 889,000 insured americans in 14 states. but swedish noted that the pool of enrollees has been too small to make the system sustainable.\n\nthe financial performance in individual aca compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations, swedish added.\n\nanthem recently fell short of its third-quarter earnings estimates as the company's costs for insured customers increased.\n\nobamacare has been on the verge of collapsing all year as the financial sustainability of the scheme has proven untenable.\n\nrecently, the obama administration had to admit that americans will be forced to pay far more for their insurance costs, as premiums are set to soar yet again next year.\n\nfollow warner todd huston on twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
medical manufacturers asked president donald trump to repeal obamacare's device tax now that the law will take effect in 2018. estimates suggest that the tax's repeal could create another 53,000 jobs.\n\nrepublicans managed to repeal obamacare's individual mandate through the historic tax cuts and jobs act, however, obamacare's medical device tax will take effect in the new year.\n\nobamacare's 2.3 percent medical device tax will take effect on january 1 after republicans unsuccessfully managed to repeal the excise tax. the medical device industry strongly opposed the tax, which will be levied on everything from catheters to heart stents to artificial joints.\n\ncongress suspended the tax for 2016 and 2o17, although the tax's repeal was not included in the republican tax cuts and jobs act, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) failed to pass an obamacare repeal bill through congress' upper chamber on multiple occasions. most obamacare bills, including the better care reconciliation act, sen. rand paul's (r-ky) clean obamacare repeal bill, and the graham-cassidy obamacare repeal bill would have repealed obamacare's medical device tax.\n\nthe advanced medical technology associations (advamed) and the medical imaging & technology alliance warn that the tax will negatively affect the industry by $20 billion over the next ten years.\n\nj.c. scott, advamed's head of government affairs, said, what we have seen from past experience is that it comes out of funding for product development, research and the jobs associated with those things. we fear we will see employment freezes or reductions and a slowdown in the pipeline for medical innovation.\n\nboston scientific, a major medical device manufacturer, said in a statement, the reinstatement of the device tax threatens continued investment in programs like these.\n\nthe american action forum (aaf) predicted america could lose more than 21,000 jobs with the return of the medical device tax. aaf added that the net impact of the tax's repeal could create another 53,000 jobs in the country.\n\nadvamed asked president donald trump to repeal the medical device the tax and even asked them to direct the internal revenue service (irs) to grant medical firms administrative relief from the medical device tax, which could include waiving the bimonthly deposit requirement or penalties from late payments.\n\nretroactive action by congress next year cannot fully undo the impact of allowing this tax to be triggered on jan. 1, advamed argued.
dr. ezekiel emanuel, an architect of obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the world health organization, told msnbc's the last word that the united states cannot return to normal until a chinese coronavirus vaccine is available, which he speculated could take between 12-18 months.\n\na transcript is as follows:\n\ndr. ezekiel emanuel: no one is immune to the covid-19 virus. it threatens all of us. but while we are all experiencing the same pandemic, we are not experiencing it in the same way. the first dividing line is whether you or someone you love has gotten sick. many americans have not yet seen firsthand what devastation a positive test can inflict. another dividing line is whether you have a job that lets you stay at home, working as you juggle child care and video chats.\n\n60 million americans are still out there not sheltering in place and instead tirelessly working to keep everything going for the rest of us. you keep the electricity flowing and the internet running, food and groceries moving. you are putting your own health on the line to ensure the rest of us are living as normally as possible. and then there are the tens of millions of americans who have lost jobs and businesses, or who fear that they're just about to. your anxiety about the virus is coupled with worry over having a paycheck, covering the mortgage, keeping the lights on, and buying food.\n\nrealistically, covid-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more. we will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications. i know that's dreadful news to hear. how are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? is all that economic pain worth trying to stop covid-19? the truth is we have no choice. if we prematurely end that physical distancing and the other measures keeping it at bay, deaths could skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands if not a million. we cannot return to normal until there's a vaccine. conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure.

former speaker of the house john boehner has endorsed current speaker paul ryan (r-wi) for president, in the event that no republican candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot at the republican national convention in cleveland in july.\n\npolitico reports that boehner, speaking at a conference in boca raton, florida, said: if we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, i'm for none of the above. they all had a chance to win. none of them won. so i'm for none of the above. i'm for paul ryan to be our nominee.\n\nlate tuesday evening, as results from primary contests confirmed donald trump's victories in four out of five states, cnbc reported that ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.\n\nexclusive: paul ryan won't categorically rule out accepting gop nomination\n\nif a deadlocked convention turns to him https://t.co/kuxsywedzg — cnbc now (@cnbcnow) march 16, 2016\n\nryan was welcomed by conservatives as mitt romney's choice for running mate in 2012. the pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.\n\nin the aftermath of that 2012 loss, ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that republicans shared responsibility with democrats and the president. as a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support.\n\nwhen boehner resigned as speaker in 2015, however, ryan remained the only candidate capable of pulling the fractious house majority together.\n\nboth trump and rival sen. ted cruz (r-tx) have warned against a brokered convention.\n\ntwice, ryan has declined the opportunity to run for president on his own. but for republicans frustrated with trump's success, and unwilling to accept cruz as an alternative, ryan is a possible plan b.\n\na recent poll by the democrat-aligned public policy polling found americans every divided, 38%-39%, over ryan's performance thus far as speaker.\n\nhis favorability among republicans has dropped significantly, from two-thirds to less than half, since he became speaker, owing partly to his inclusion in the party establishment, and partly to his approval of budgets that raised spending and included funding for controversial programs.\n\nboehner has offered a plan b before, in the context of debate in late 2012 over the fiscal cliff as the bush tax cuts expired. his caucus rejected the plan.
friday on msnbc's morning joe, sen. rand paul (r-ky) made the argument that those who might lose their medicaid coverage due to any obamacare repeal should be offered an inexpensive option for coverage.\n\npaul proposed a $1 a day plan and said the existing system and the current proposals were predicated on propping up health insurance providers, which he claimed was $15 billion annual industry that benefits from socializing its losses.\n\nwhat i would like to do is legalize inexpensive insurance and you should be able to get insurance for $1 a day — i mean, you really should, paul said. the insurance companies make all the money. all of this is predicated upon still, you know, propping up the insurance companies. the insurance companies hate the idea of the buying pools where you can join an association and drive prices down. they absolutely hate it because they think it might eat into their profit. they love sort of privatizing their $15 billion-a-year profit but then socializing their losses in the individual market. i have absolutely no sympathy for the insurance companies to be bailed out by the taxpayer. that $15 billion in profit, that's where the risk should come from. that's where the — when we have to absorb risk when people get sick, it should come out of their profit, it shouldn't come out of the taxpayer's pocket.\n\nfollow jeff poor on twitter @jeff_poor

health and human services secretary alex azar pointed to short-term and association health plans during friday's white house press briefing as possible solutions to obamacare and health insurance premiums reaching new heights.\n\nbreitbart news asked azar about insurers in areas like maryland and virginia who are considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019. there's a maryland regulator that's said something like the aca is in a 'death spiral,' echoing past words of the president [donald trump]. what are you doing to deal with that? does hhs just accept these premium increases as reality? what are you doing to reduce those costs?\n\nazar said some of the premiums being discussed now are the very beginning of a process that happens with state regulators around those insurance designs.\n\nthe secretary pointed to the massive obamacare premium increases which occurred under president obama. they continue because of the structural infirmities in how obamacare was designed, he explained.\n\nazar highlighted president trump's efforts to solve the problem of spiking rates:\n\nthis is why the president has been so adamant about producing alternative, affordable options for patients because for so many, the 28 million forgotten men and women in this country have been forced out of the individual market and are sitting there without insurance even though they were promised they would have accessible, affordable, competitive insurance that they could keep. 6.7 million americans paid 3.1 billion dollars in the obamacare taxes for the privilege of not buying insurance they couldn't afford and didn't want and 80 percent of them make 50,000 dollars or less. so we're trying to bring short-term plans as an option for people. we're trying to bring association health plans out of the labor department as options for people. the president is just- we want to keep looking for more options to get people out of some of the traps that the obamacare system has created of these high cost and uncompetitive plans for people.\n\nmaryland and virginia health insurers are among those considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019 for individual plans, according to bloomberg. these states' rates are the first 2019 rates being revealed. maryland insurance commissioner al redmer jr. said one insurer is looking to nearly double rates in his state. i believe we've been in a death spiral for a year or two, he told reporters on a recent call.\n\nhealth carriers have fled cities like charlottesville, virginia under what kaiser health news described as the instability of the obamacare marketplace, which it said, created a coverage vacuum, leaving locals and insurance regulators scrambling.\n\nhealth insurance premiums have soared under obamacare. hhs reported in may 2017 that average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on healthcare.gov in 2017 – an increase of $2,928 or 105%.\n\nefforts to fulfill the campaign pledges of many republicans to repeal obamacare stalled after a late attempt to pass even a skinny repeal bill sank with sen. john mccain's thumbs down vote. what the administration has managed to do is repeal the health insurance mandate with a provision in the major tax cut plan passed late last year.\n\npresident trump and secretary azar unveiled a new plan on friday to return prescription drug prices to levels that are affordable for americans. the two announced the blueprint to lower drug prices in a white house rose garden ceremony. azar took reporters' questions in the white house briefing room shortly thereafter.\n\nfollow michelle moons on twitter @michellediana
rep. john lewis (d-ga) told msnbc's chris matthews on hardball on monday that president donald trump feels at home with recent acts of racist violence, citing trump's comments on the charlottesville riots in 2017 as proof.\n\nlewis said:\n\ni don't think this president has been helpful. i think he feels at home with what is going on. when he reacted to what was happening in charlottesville, you know, good people on both sides, i cried. it's not the america that i dream for, the one i was trying to help set right. it's not the america we had during the days of president [john f.] kennedy and lyndon johnson. it's — it's different.\n\nin fact, president trump had been referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of confederate general robert e. lee. he specifically excluded neo-nazis and extremists, whom he said should be condemned totally.\n\nmoreover, trump had delivered a televised statement from the white house the day before. racism is evil — and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including kkk, neo-nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans, he said, as cnn noted.\n\nlewis, prompted by matthews — who likened him to a character out of the bible — went on to claim that trump's election arrested that movement toward goodness and openness that had characterized race relations under his predecessors.\n\nin fact, a widely-cited gallup poll shows race relations began to decline during president barack obama's second term, in the aftermath of the trayvon martin controversy and through the black lives matter movement that followed.\n\nin 2010, lewis was at the center of another alleged racial hoax, when several democratic members of the congressional black caucus claimed that tea party protesters had shouted the n-word at him as he walked through their demonstration on the weekend that congress was voting on obamacare. the claim, widely repeated throughout the media and used to malign the tea party as racist, was never substantiated.\n\nthough lewis and his colleagues were surrounded by hundreds of video cameras at the time, no video of the alleged incident has ever emerged, despite the late andrew breitbart offering to donate $100,000 to the united negro college fund in exchange for any video proof of the incident.\n\nlewis, who was infamously beaten during a civil rights march across the edmund pettus bridge in selma, alabama, in 1965, has been known to put the heroism of his distinguished past to partisan use.\n\nin 2008, lewis cast sen. john mccain (r-az) and alaska gov. sarah palin as racists, likening the republican presidential ticket to segregationist (democrat) george wallace, noting that wallace created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent americans and warning the republican candidates were doing the same, without explaining how. mccain had, in fact, just cited lewis as one of three leaders whom he would consult for advice once elected. in 2018, after mccain's death, lewis praised the late senator as a warrior for peace.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
the new york times admitted wednesday that former vice president joe biden is not pivoting toward the center, as most candidates do when they have secured their party's nomination. rather, he is moving to the left — toward embracing what the times refers to as systemic disruption.\n\nbiden was already the most left-wing frontrunner in u.s. electoral history. now he has adopted the rhetoric of the far left as well, calling the coronavirus an opportunity to fundamentally transform the country.\n\nthen-sen. barack obama (d-il) made a similar promise on the campaign trail in 2008, telling voters they were just days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america. the country was in the midst of the financial crisis, and desperate for new leadership. after obama won, his incoming chief of staff, rahm emanuel, infamously said: you never want a serious crisis to go to waste. the new administration focused on big, ideological changes — not the ailing economy.\n\nbiden was happy to go along with all of that. he called the passage of obamacare a big f—ing deal on an open mic. but biden himself was not a radical. nor was he a moderate. his record in the senate was wildly inconsistent, driven more by political expediency than ideological convictions.\n\nthe main skill biden brought to the obama administration was his ability to schmooze fellow senators — a skill that was largely neglected, as obama was uninterested in negotiating with congress.\n\ntoday, biden's political skills are obsolete. he promises to unify the country, but that promise is based on casting trump as some kind of nazi sympathizer, and his voters as racists.\n\nbiden wants to take the country back to normal — where normal means fulfilling obama's most ambitious policies: taxing the rich, throwing open the country's borders to illegal aliens, ending the fossil fuel industry, moving toward socialized medicine, and sending money to regimes that support terrorism.\n\nbiden made the bizarre comment earlier this month that he sees himself as a transition candidate. he has no vision of his own. his job is to be a bridge between the muted radicalism of obama and the revolutionary zeal of the new resistance.\n\nbiden said that he was making way for the mayor petes of the world to come into my administration. but this week, he brought rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) onto his team, alongside other radicals. that is who will drive the agenda.\n\nin march, biden floated his potential cabinet picks. aside from pete buttigieg and a few other former presidential rivals, many of them were old obama hands: former secretary of state john kerry, former national security advisor susan rice, former deputy attorney general sally yates, and more.\n\nbiden's health care policy team includes dr. ezekiel emanuel, an architect of obamacare; his foreign policy advisors include jake sullivan, who helped negotiate the hopeless iran deal.\n\nbiden's new and expanded team, however, looks more like a sanders administration. in addition to ocasio-cortez, who will co-chair biden's panel on climate change, biden has recruited stephanie kelton, a former sanders adviser who is described as the foremost evangelist of a fringe economic movement called modern monetary theory, which, in part, argues that the government should pay for programs requiring big spending, such as the green new deal, by simply printing more money.\n\nall campaigns have teams of advisers. with biden, however, they are particularly important, as the candidate himself is old, ailing, and isolated. (new york magazine reported this week that none of biden's top advisers have seen him in person since mid-march.)\n\na biden presidency would function as a regency, run by obama alumni in pursuit of sanders policies. neither he nor his vice president would lead these groups, but take direction from them. the real power would be behind the scenes.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news and the host of breitbart news sunday on sirius xm patriot on sunday evenings from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. et (4 p.m. to 7 p.m. pt). his new book, red november, is available for pre-order. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.

president donald trump touted the benefits of the tax cuts and jobs law and welcomed american beneficiaries of it to share their personal stories during a friday celebration of the law's six month anniversary.\n\ntrump was welcomed by a white house east room packed with supporters. they gave him a loud and prolonged standing ovation and cheers:\n\nthe president opened the event by taking a few moments to offer thoughts, prayers, and a message regarding the thursday shooting at the capital gazette in annapolis, maryland:\n\nbefore going any further today, i want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the capital gazette newsroom in annapolis, maryland. this attack shocked the conscience of our nation, and filled our hearts with grief… pic.twitter.com/lalxghk04b — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 29, 2018\n\npresident trump then moved to recount the events that have followed the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act.\n\nunfortunately every single democrat in the house and senate …voted against lower taxes for the hard-working americans, he lamented.\n\nhe highlighted the reduction of income taxes, near doubling of the standard deduction, and the doubling of the child tax credit for individuals.\n\ntrump said a family of four bringing in around $75,000 a year would see an average greater than $2,000 income tax cut.\n\nwhen it comes to businesses, trump touted the lowering of the corporate tax cut so the american worker finally has a level playing field. he promoted the business tax reforms, including immediate expensing and cuts to the unfair estate death tax.\n\nthe president called 100% expensing in the year of equipment purchases, one of the best kept secrets of the tax plann and said, i think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.\n\nhe also spoke of the approval of anwar. he then said he almost didn't agree to including anwar because he was angry with someone, but hearing that president ronald reagan and others had tried to get anwar, he decided he wanted it included immediately.\n\ntrump touted the inclusion of repeal of the obamacare individual mandate. obamacare is just about over, he said, indicating that the department of health and human services is working on a new plan to be released in a very short period of time.\n\nsix months after our tax cuts, more than six million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement, said trump.\n\nover 300 billion dollars was just repatriated into our country in the first quarter alone, trump said in reference to a provision of the tax cut law that eases repatriation of funds. he added that many more are being brought back in the hundreds of millions, including repatriation of apple computers' funds. he connected the repatriation to the growth of jobs.\n\nmore than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving americans three billion dollars on their utility bills, said trump.\n\nhe highlighted unemployment claims that have hit a 44 year low. he pointed also to historically low african american and hispanic unemployment, low unemployment for women, and low unemployment for disabled americans.\n\namerica finally has a tax system that is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-american, emphasized trump.\n\ntrump pointed to several guests gathered on stage and allowed two to give accounts of how the tax cut law has benefitted them personally and professionally.\n\nlasonya hill shared that the bonus she received as a result of the new tax law is helping her family to fund her two sons' college educations. her sons were standing next to her on stage.\n\nguy chemical founder guy berkebile has hired 30 employees, increased employee bonuses and salaries, purchased new equipment, and built a new and five-times-larger lab facility as a result of the law. two of berkebile's employees joined him onstage. he shared how he struggled in the early years of his company and how the new law has helped his company and employees.\n\nsix months after our tax cuts, more than 6 million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement account contributions.#taxcutsandjobsact https://t.co/mevjwiingu — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 29, 2018\n\ntrump then turned to say that with the tax law in place, his administration is looking to make progress on trade with other nations. our trade has been a disaster. we were being taken advantage of as a country by many, many countries, he said.\n\nhe pointed to the resurgence of the american steel industry in the wake of anti-steel dumping tariffs he issued earlier this year.\n\npresident trump said as a result of these measures, billions of dollars will come into our treasury.\n\ntrump pointed also to anti-washing machine dumping tariffs and solar tariffs. he said washing machine plants and solar plants that had been closed are coming back to life.\n\nmany countries are calling, saying 'let's negotiate', said trump. they weren't doing that before.\n\nall we want is fairness, he said. we're gonna be the smart country

msnbc anchor chris matthews on friday night after the 2020 democratic presidential candidates debated in manchester, nh attacked sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) for identifying as a socialist.\n\nwhile praising sen. amy klobuchar (d-mn), matthews said, she had the guts to talk about the issue of this campaign, socialism. some people like it. those of us like me who grew up in the cold war and saw some aspects of it after visiting places like vietnam, cuba, being there, i've seen what socialism is. i don't like it. it's not only not free. it doesn't freaking work.\n\nhe added, i think the democratic party has to figure out its ideology. in britain, we had a liberal party, and they were overtaken by the socialist party, and they became the main challenger to the tories. churchill went back to the tories. and a lot of us know that history. a lot of us will be sorting things out if the democratic party runs a socialist candidate. the democratic party's been the left of the republican party on the issue of mixed capitalism. they push social security, medicare, medicaid, enormously popular programs. aca, obamacare has also, i wished they will follow through with it and make the work. i think most americans would be happy to have a public option and have medicare followed through with.\n\nhe continued, i have my own views of the word socialist, and i'll be glad to share them with you in private. they go back to the early 1950s. i have an attitude about them. i remember the cold war. i have an attitude towards castro. i believe if castro and the reds had won the cold war, there would have been executions in central park. and i would have been one of the ones executed, and certain other people would be there cheering. so, i have a problem with people for the other side. i don't know what bernie means by socialism. one week it's denmark. we're going to be like denmark. i'm like that's harmless, a capitalist program with a lot of good social programs.\n\nhe concluded, that's a great question, what did you think of castro? we all thought he was great at first. i was cheering like mad for him when he first came in, and then he became a communist and started shooting every one of his enemies.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen
sex pistols frontman johnny rotten isn't afraid to buck the establishment and sound the alarm over l.a.'s homeless epidemic, which has literally landed at his front door.\n\nthe 63-year-old lives in venice beach where there has been a surge of homeless vagrants that have vandalized his multi-million dollar home and spoiled the beaches with poo and needles.\n\na couple of weeks ago i had a problem, he said. they came over the gate and put their tent inside, right in front of the front door. it's like . . . the audacity. and if you complain, what are you? oh, one of the establishment elite? no, i'm a bloke that's worked hard for his money and i expect to be able to use my own front door.\n\nhe added that his wife nora, who suffers from alzheimer's, isn't able to cope with bums trying to steal the iron bars off the windows for the scrap metal and bricks coming through his windows.\n\nmy wife's ill and she can't cope with this. but at 2 a.m. last week, a brick whizzed through the top floor window, the bedroom. sorry, mr. policeman. i need your help.\n\nthe vagrants moved in en masse . . . [in] tent cities. they're all young; they're all like 24, he said, adding that, they're aggressive, and because there's an awful lot of them together they're gang-y.\n\nthey have also spoiled beach life: and the heroin spikes . . . you can't take anyone to the beach because there's jabs just waiting for young kids to put their feet in — and poo all over the sand.\n\nthis might sound like hypocrisy coming from a punk rocker, but it's really not. the whole ethos of '70s and '80s punk rock is live and let live. no rules … at least until you interfere with me living the life i want to live, which is exactly what is happening to rotten.\n\nif you want to know what an actual punk rock sellout looks like, i give you henry rollins, the vandals legend who endorsed … obamacare.\n\nin fact, rotten (whose real name is john lydon) is bucking an establishment that treats these vagrants as sacred cows while at the same time pretending they do not exist because their rising numbers reflect badly on the democrat-run strongholds that cannot manage the growing problem.\n\nthe media and the left-wing political establishment want us to see the homeless as victims of a cruel american capitalism that allows good people to fall through society's cracks. naturally, the only solution to this problem is big government socialism.\n\nbut the truth is that american capitalism licked poverty decades ago. the so-called poor in this country now have cable tv, central heat, air conditioning, videogames, microwave ovens, iphones, and struggle with over eating. the homeless are an altogether different problem.\n\ncertainly, good people slip through the cracks temporarily. no question. but there are all kinds of avenues to help those who are sincere about getting back on their feet. the homeless epidemic is actually an epidemic of mental illness, addiction, and tolerance.\n\ncity's that tolerate poopy beaches and sidewalks, hypodermic needles, and aggressive panhandling only end up attracting even bigger problems and making the lives of their normal citizens miserable.\n\njohnny rotten complaining about one of the most sacred of sacred cows is as punk as it gets, and so is his support of trump and brexit.\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
a group of house and senate republicans is asking president joe biden to withdraw his nomination of california attorney general xavier becerra (d) to be health and human services (hhs) secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens.\n\nin a letter to biden, 11 senate republicans and 64 house republicans — led by sen. tom cotton (r-ar) and rep. dan bishop (r-nc) — are asking biden to rescind becerra's nomination to lead hhs due to his embrace of radical policies on immigration, among other issues.\n\nmr. becerra seeks to decriminalize illegal immigration, which would extend expensive government benefits like medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders, the letter states.\n\nsignatories include sens. tom cotton (r-ar), john kennedy (r-la), ted cruz (r-tx), mike rounds (r-sd), james lankford (r-ok), steve daines (r-mt), roger wicker (r-ms), marsha blackburn (r-tn), bill haggerty (r-tn), james risch (r-id), and mike lee (r-ut).\n\nhouse republicans like reps. dan bishop (r-nc), mo brooks (r-al), barry moore (r-al), paul gosar (r-az), bob good (r-va), jim banks (r-in), ashley hinson (r-ia), andy biggs (r-az), chip roy (r-tx), and lauren boebert (r-co) also signed the letter.\n\nthe full letter can be read here:\n\ncotton-bishop letter to bid… by john binder\n\nat a senate confirmation hearing on tuesday, none of the committee's 22 senators asked becerra about his reported support for providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the united states ,even as at least 30 million americans are uninsured.\n\nin a report this week, becerra's colleagues said he is potentially interested in pursuing policies as hhs secretary that would expand taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.\n\n… becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through medicaid or obamacare, politico reported.\n\nformer rep. charles gonzalez (d-tx) told politico that becerra has exceedingly deep convictions about the need to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens — a plan that could cost americans anywhere from $23 billion to $66 billion annually.\n\nmedical experts, when the policy was first proposed by the majority of democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2019, have admitted that providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens would likely drive a never-ending migration flow of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the u.s.\n\njohn binder is a reporter for breitbart news. email him at jbinder@breitbart.com. follow him on twitter here.
the little sisters of the poor will return to the u.s. supreme court wednesday for historic telephonic oral arguments to ask that pennsylvania be blocked from removing their religious exemption from obamacare's contraceptive mandate.\n\nthe case of the order of catholic nuns who care for the elderly sick and poor is among the handful the supreme court has decided to hear telephonically during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nthe little sisters are hoping the high court will finally end their seven-year legal battle against the obama-era mandate that requires them to provide free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.\n\nthe sisters aren't just fighting for their residents during this pandemic. they are fighting for everybody. #religiousfreedom for all!

house speaker ryan said that he couldn't be happier that mitt romney will run for the u.s. senate seat.\n\npaul ryan said in a statement released friday:\n\nthis is a terrific day for the united states senate. i was honored to join mitt romney on the national ticket in 2012 and couldn't be happier that he's running for this seat. our party and our country are always better off when mitt is engaged, and i know that he will put his unparalleled experience, conservative leadership, and lifetime of service to work for utah in the u.s. senate. janna and i adore mitt and ann. his campaign has my unwavering support, and the people of utah will be getting an accomplished and decent man when they make him their next senator.\n\npaul ryan ran with mitt romney as his vice presidential candidate.\n\nromney said in his announcement video, i have decided to run for united states senate because i believe i can help bring utah's values and utah's lessons to washington.\n\nromney also suggested that he will contrast president donald trump's immigration policies to restrict legal immigration, saying, utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.\n\nryan williams, a republican strategist who worked on romney's presidential campaign, said, the governor is a statesman and has an independent voice he lends to certain issues. when he thinks the president is saying something undermining america's ideas or principles, he'll speak out.\n\nwilliams added, but he's with the president on a number of issues — if he had been in the senate, he would have voted to repeal obamacare, supported the tax cuts.
outgoing senate minority leader harry reid told congressional republicans that people will die if they repeal obamacare, the hill reported.\n\nreid also said that congressional republicans do not have the nerve to roll back obamacare.\n\nthey don't have enough nerve to repeal obamacare. and if they do, they are just a lot more visionless than i can imagine, reid told the huffington post.\n\nrepublican leadership has vowed to repeal obamacare within president-elect donald trump's first 100 days in office, but have said that it could take years before those who have access to health insurance because of the law will have to transition to a new program.\n\nobamacare supporters have said that repealing the law could destabilize the insurance market and leave consumers without health insurance.\n\nreid said he does not think republicans will mind a marketplace collapse because it will pressure democrats into compromising to create a replacement.\n\ncan you think of — maybe there is something more cold and calculated and mean-spirited than that: 'let's have a few people die.' because that's what'll happen. you get rid of obamacare, people are going to die, he said.
other than proving just how awful the other democrat presidential candidates are, the fact has-been joe biden continues to dominate the democrat primary polls must be superb news for president trump. he knows if biden wins the nomination it will be 2016 all over again, meaning a rerun of his world-shaking defeat of hillary clinton.\n\nthe similarities between creepy joe and crooked hillary are becoming more and more apparent by the day.\n\nancient\n\non election day 2020, joe biden will be 78.\n\non election day 2016, hillary clinton was 69, and looked 78.\n\ndespite some obvious plastic surgery, biden looks, sounds, and acts every day of his decrepitude.\n\ntwo-time presidential losers\n\njoe biden has tried and failed to run for president twice before — once in '88, when he was forced to quit in disgrace over his serial plagiarism, and once in 2008, where his candidacy went nowhere.\n\nhillary at least won the democrat nomination on her second try, in 2016.\n\nlike biden, though, she also lost to obama in 2008.\n\nthe old and tired disappear to rest\n\njust like hillary in 2016, who was obviously old and unwell, biden is running a part-time political campaign.\n\nrather than earn the nomination, he is sitting on his lead, on what he believes is a sure thing; popping up here and there to give a speech, but probably spending most of his days at home watching reruns of matlock — or as he calls them: his stories.\n\nno ideas, just finger-wagging against the bad orange man\n\nwhen hillary did bother to go out and earn votes, it generally would be before small, hand-picked crowds where she would rant about how indecent trump is. to this day i cannot tell you what she was running on or what her vision for the country was. she felt we had to vote for her because trump was such a terrible person.\n\nas i write this, biden is stepping away from matlock long enough to give a speech eviscerating trump.\n\nso tired. so familiar.\n\nthis is a country that chooses presidents on competence — not virtue, especially not sanctimonious and self-righteous virtue.\n\nwhile trump fights for america and americans, biden is frank burns.\n\nrepresenting the not-so-great past\n\nwhile trump ran on a very clear and precise agenda about lowering taxes, cutting regulations, protecting gun and religious rights, getting a handle on illegal immigration, and making america great again, hillary promised a return to the 1990s, to the clinton years, as though that would be a good thing.\n\nsure, because her husband stayed out of the way of a booming economy ushered in by the reagan/bush years and a tech boom, the 90s were prosperous… but the clinton years were more than just an economy. they represented a decade of scandal and perjury and extra-marital affairs and ethical short cuts and the renting of the lincoln bedroom.\n\nbiden is running on the same, on the past, on a hoped-for nostalgia for the obamacare and benghazi boondoggles, the managed decline of america at home and abroad, and a government boot on the neck of an economy that ushered in the worst economic recovery in nearly a century.\n\nno thanks.\n\nflip-flops to appease the left\n\nbiden has no idea what he believes in, he just wants to win.\n\nhillary had no idea what she believed in, she just wanted to win.\n\nyou cannot get a bead on what either of them intend to do, other than to cave to media and left-wing pressure at every turn.\n\nsay what you want about trump, he is what he is, he does what he says, and he stands his ground. his vision and ideas are clear, and you do not have to agree with him to see that.\n\ntwo massive scandals the corrupt media cannot hide\n\nhillary was burdened by the massive scandals surrounding the clinton foundation and the secret server she set up in the bathroom of her private home while serving as secretary of state.\n\ncreepy joe is dealing with two massive scandals involving his son hunter's shady business dealings in china and ukraine.\n\nin the past, as recently as 2008 — as we saw with the scandals surrounding obama's racist church, his unforgivable relationships with a domestic terrorist and louis farrakhan, and the shady deal to purchase his chicago home — the establishment media were able to bury democrat scandals to get their guy over the finish line.\n\nthankfully, the media landscape has shifted considerably over the last 11 years and there is no way new media (or trump) will allow the corrupt media to wish biden's scandals into a cornfield.\n\nbiden will have to answer for these scandals and so far his answers stink.\n\nall that family baggage\n\ncorrupt hillary had rapey bill.\n\ncreepy joe has moneyhungry hunter.\n\ninevitability\n\nin 2008 and 2016, hillary ran on the idea it was her turn, that she deserved the presidency, that she was inevitable.\n\nbiden is doing the same: posing as above-it-all, refusing to engage his opponents, already fighting a general election campaign against trump, and watching matlock instead of hustling.\n\nthis attitude not only turns off voters who want to feel as though their vote has been earned, it keeps the candidate in a bubble, out of touch, rusty, and unprepared when the going does get rough.\n\nno rational to be president\n\nother than breaking the glass ceiling and it being her turn, why did hillary want to be president?\n\nyou can say the same of biden. does anyone know why he wants to be president — i mean other than a return to the normalcy of lost wars, managed economic decline, and kissing the corrupt media's ass?\n\nagree or not, like him or not, we all know trump's rational for being president. he has an actual vision, he is the man of a thousand ideas…\n\nreturn to normalcy is not a rational, is not a vision… it's nostalgia.\n\nmistreatment of women\n\nthanks to new media and trump's beautiful and bottomless audacity, hillary was not allowed to get away with posing as women's champion, not when her record of seeking to destroy her husband's victims is as well-documented as it is horrifying.\n\nthe same goes for creepy joe's inability to control his desire to inappropriately touch women and young girls. this has all been captured on video, and like hillary, biden is unrepentant about his behavior and refuses to stop.\n\nsuper white\n\nthe democrat base is primarily energized by one animating idea, the most un-american idea of all, and that is identity politics. until the party regains its senses, which is unlikely in my lifetime, white people need not apply.\n\npresidential elections are about turnout in a handful of states and turnout is driven by passion, and passion comes from falling in love with your candidate, and no one will ever fall in love with joe biden.\n\nno charisma\n\nhillary clinton had the charisma of a spinster who lives in a big house and yells at trick-or-treaters.\n\nbiden has the charisma of a an oily lounge singer, a guy with zero self-awareness who honestly believes he's tom jones, who even in middle age is certain he is on the verge of being discovered, who never stops dining off that time in 1981 when he opened for tony bennett and tony bennett said, nice job, kid.\n\nworse still, biden thinks he's sexy because women throw their panties up on the stage, but no one has the heart to tell him his manager/promoter/driver/brother-in-law is the one throwing the panties.\n\nbill clinton had charisma. barack obama has charisma. trump has charisma.\n\njoe biden is a creepy, tired, has-been.\n\nfollow john nolte on twitter @noltenc. follow his facebook page here.
the nearly 800,0o0 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the president obama-created deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program will not receive special prioritization to have their status renewed, as the original march 5 deadline for the program remains meaningless.\n\nin september 2017, attorney general jeff sessions announced that daca — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on march 5. however, since then, a california judge claimed the decision to end daca violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.\n\nsince the ruling, the federal government has now had to renew daca amnesty for illegal aliens who apply for renewal. this renewing of daca will continue until the supreme court makes its decision in a few months.\n\nwhile daca illegal aliens can keep renewing their amnesty status, they will not be prioritized, according to the united states citizenship and immigration services (uscis).\n\nthere is not a prioritization, department of homeland security (dhs) press secretary tyler houlton told politico. uscis is processing applications as they are submitted.\n\nas daca illegal aliens can remain in the u.s. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire gop megadonors the koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the republican-controlled congress and president trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.\n\nspokesperson for the koch brothers says its crucial to continue inflow of admitting more than one million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year: we just need to know there's going to be no reduction to legal immigration. https://t.co/411hstdvuk — john binder 👽 (@jxhnbinder) march 2, 2018\n\nthe koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which daca illegal aliens are described as patriots to the u.s.\n\nwe love our country, our way of life, and we sacrifice and fight to defend it, the ad begins, narrated by the voice of a daca illegal alien. we work hard, put food on the table, care for our families, and we pledge allegiance to this flag. we are patriots. we are dreamers. we believe america's best days are yet to come. and we want to be a part of it. [emphasis added]\n\nthe koch brothers' daca amnesty push comes after the billionaire, avid free trade, low-wage-seeking, open borders defenders announced that they would oppose trump's popular pro-american immigration agenda that seeks to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life of america's working and middle class.\n\nwe just need to know there's going to be no reduction to legal immigration, a spokesperson for the koch brothers said.\n\nthe koch brothers and their pro-mass immigration, corporatist views are deeply out-of-line with the american people, especially the country's working and middle class, who have been hit the hardest by the importation of more than a million low-skilled legal immigrants a year.\n\nfor example, as breitbart news reported, republican voters — even those who did not vote for trump's economic nationalist agenda — said they see reducing legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority, more important than destroying the islamic state (isis), repealing obamacare, and tax reform.
