tokyo - european shares fell monday as oil prices slipped back below $32 a barrel while asian markets were buoyed for a second day by stimulus hopes.\n\ngermany's dax fell 0.5 percent to 9,717.15 and france's cac 40 lost 0.7 percent to 4,306.61. britain's ftse 100 slipped 0.6 percent to 5,863.96.\n\nwall street looked set for a tepid open: dow futures were down 0.2 percent and broader s&p 500 futures were essentially flat.\n\na rally in battered crude oil prices that began friday appears short-lived. after modest gains earlier in the day, u.s. crude was down $1.10 to $31.09 per barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange. on friday, it shot up $2.66 to $32.19 a barrel in new york. brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, lost $1.11 to $31.07 a barrel. it gained $2.93, or 10 percent, on friday to $32.18 a barrel in london.\n\nmarkets have rallied on hints of further easing by the ecb and speculation that the boj will follow suit. but there has been no major change in fundamentals to support the rally, and the concern is if and when it fizzles out, markets could even drop below their recent lows, angus nicholson of ig said in a commentary.\n\non friday european central bank head mario draghi said the bank has a lot of options to boost inflation and is determined and willing to act. on thursday draghi suggested the ecb will consider more stimulus action at its next meeting in march. the signals from europe also spurred expectations that the bank of japan would consider adding to its already lavish stimulus.\n\ninvestors shrugged off trade data for december released monday that showed exports fell for three straight months, though imports fell at a faster pace thanks to the collapse in oil prices. the december trade surplus of 140.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion) compared with a deficit of 379.7 billion yen in november and a deficit of 665.6 billion yen in december 2014. share prices were supported by speculation the central bank may opt for further monetary easing at a two-day policy meeting that starts thursday.\n\njapan's nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent to 17,110.91 and hong kong's hang seng jumped 1.4 percent to 19,340.14. the shanghai composite index climbed 0.8 percent to2,938.51 and australia's s&p/asx 200 rose 1.8 percent to 5,006.60. south korea's kospi was up 0.7 percent at 1,893.43, and shares in taiwan, new zealand and southeast asia also were higher.\n\nthe dollar edged down to 118.30 yen from 118.79 yen on friday. the euro rose to $1.0826 from $1.0799.
sheboygan, wis. -- a wisconsin sheriff has defended his decision to hire a man convicted of killing and dismembering his girlfriend nearly 40 years ago in texas.\n\nrafael george macias has worked as a radio technician for the sheboygan county sheriff's department since 2011 after performing similar duties as a contract employee for 10 years.\n\nmacias was a 20-year-old airman at carswell air force base in north texas when he pleaded guilty to killing and dismembering his live-in girlfriend, julia adams, in 1977. macias was sentenced to 40 years in prison, but was released after 13 years.\n\nwhile at the texas state penitentiary at huntsville, macias earned an associate degree as a radio technician. he eventually moved to wisconsin and ended up working at his cousin's radio shop.\n\nmacias told the associated press on thursday that he never lied about his past and was upfront with sheriff todd priebe when he wanted to bring him on as a regular employee. details of the case resurfaced when an anonymous letter was sent recently to media outlets, including the milwaukee journal sentinel, questioning why sheboygan county employees had to work with someone who committed such a horrible crime.\n\nmacias said he's not sure what the motivation was in bringing up his crime to the media, but knows he has priebe's support.\n\nyou can't change what happened. it happened, macias said. what you can do is change what you do in the future and don't put your life to waste.\n\npriebe said macias has proven himself as a trusted employee and is a rehabilitation success story.\n\nmacias said through faith, anger management counseling and maturity he has become a better man.\n\nas far as i'm concerned, that guy is dead, macias said referring to his younger self, adding, it was a fit of rage.\n\npriebe said he will meet with the county board's law committee at its request to discuss the hiring, but the committee does not have the authority to overrule his decision.
rescue teams searching for survivors four days after a landslide carried away homes in a norwegian village found no signs of life saturday amid the ruined buildings and debris. three bodies have been recovered but searchers are still looking for seven more people believed to be missing.\n\nthe landslide in the village of ask is the worst in modern norwegian history and has shocked citizens in the nordic nation.\n\nsearch teams patrolled with dogs as helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras flew amid harsh winter conditions over the ravaged hillside in ask, a village of 5,000 people 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of oslo.\n\nnorwegian police pledged not to scale down the search even though a rescue team from neighboring sweden has already returned home.\n\nlocal police chief ida melbo oeystese said it may still be possible to find survivors in air pockets inside the destroyed buildings.\n\nmedically, you can survive for several days if you have air, she told reporters at a news conference.\n\nflattened homes lie covered in snow as rescue crews work with a dog in the landslide area at ask, gjerdrum, norway january 2, 2021. ntb/erik schroeder via reuters\n\nby late saturday, a second and third body had been found after a first one was discovered on friday. only a dalmatian dog has been rescued alive from the ruins so far.\n\nking harald v, queen sonja and crown prince haakon plan to visit the disaster area on sunday to pay their respects to the victims and to meet with residents and rescue workers. the 83-year-old monarch said in his new year's speech that the royal family had been deeply moved by the tragedy.\n\nnorwegian police have published the names and birth years of the 10 people initially reported missing, including a 2-year-old child. officials haven't yet identified the three recovered bodies.\n\nthe landslide early wednesday cut across a road through ask, leaving a deep, crater-like ravine. photos and videos showed buildings hanging on the edge of the ravine, which grew to be 700 meters (2,300 feet) long and 300 meters (1,000 feet) wide. at least nine buildings with over 30 apartments were destroyed.\n\nthe rescue operation is being hampered by the limited number of daylight hours in norway at this time of year and fears of further erosion. the ground is fragile at the site and unable to hold the weight of rescue equipment, including a heavy vehicle from the norwegian military.\n\nover 1,000 people have been evacuated, and officials said up to 1,500 people may be moved from the area amid fears of further landslides.\n\nthe exact cause of the accident is not yet known but the gjerdrum municipality, where ask is located, is known for having a lot of quick clay, a material that can change from solid to liquid form. experts said the substance of the clay combined with excessive precipitation and the damp weather typical for norway at this time of year may have contributed to the landslide.\n\nnorwegian authorities in 2005 warned people not to construct residential buildings in the area, but houses were eventually built there later in the decade.\n\nspokeswoman toril hofshagen from the norwegian water resources and energy directorate called the landslide unique in its destruction.\n\nnot since 1893 has there been a quick clay landslide of this dimension in norway, hofshagen told the media on saturday.
the following is a script from danny clinch which aired on feb. 14, 2016. anderson cooper is the correspondent. david browning and michelle st. john, producers.\n\nin march of 1999, an up-and-coming photographer named danny clinch got two phone calls that would change his life. the first came from bob dylan's manager, asking him to take some pictures of the legendary singer. and a few hours later, bruce springsteen's people also called to book him for a shoot.\n\nin the 17 years since, danny clinch has photographed just about every heavyweight in the music world: rappers, rockers, country stars, jazz and pop artists. tomorrow night, he'll be backstage at the grammys, taking portraits of the winners as he has for 13 years now. clinch has developed friendships with many of his subjects, and that gets him up close and personal access onstage and off. for example:\n\nbruce springsteen -- hitting the road on tour once more, his wife patti by his side. and danny clinch is there to talk a bit about old times and shoot the band rehearsing.\n\ndanny clinch: in '99, was the first time i photographed you guys and it was then.\n\npatti scialfa: '99, right.\n\n[bruce springsteen: one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four...]\n\nover the years, clinch has taken thousands of pictures of springsteen. and many have become classics.\n\ndanny clinch: this is in a farmhouse that's on bruce's property. and it's just a really sweet little spot.\n\nthere are portraits of the artist offstage that mirror the tone and the message of his music. and there's the famous shot of springsteen falling back into the crowd, where from the stage, clinch had a perfect view.\n\ndanny clinch: i was like, right in there. and he fell back and i got my shot.\n\nanderson cooper: and did you know you got it?\n\ndanny clinch: i felt like i did. yeah.\n\nclinch wears many hats, pun intended. as the official portrait photographer at the grammys, he covers the musical spectrum. tony bennett and lady gaga.\n\ndanny clinch: i'm not like a strong-arm guy. i want to collaborate.\n\ncountry star miranda lambert.\n\ndanny clinch: you want to make people relaxed.\n\nsinger-songwriter sam smith.\n\ndanny clinch: you want to find a common ground as quickly as you can.\n\nfoo fighter dave grohl and paul mccartney.\n\ndanny clinch: you're in a sense part of the history of that moment. and i never really get tired of that, and i never take it for granted.\n\n[trey anastasio: you want to go up onstage?\n\ndanny clinch: yeah.]\n\nhe goes way back with many musicians. that's trey anastasio of the band phish, one of several that let him shoot on stage, trusting him to stay out of the way.\n\nit's new year's eve: phish is playing madison square garden and to the crowd, clinch is the invisible man.\n\nanderson cooper: what is it about shooting a concert? what are you trying to get?\n\ndanny clinch: i'm trying to capture a moment. it's not about the singer at the microphone. i'm trying to look for, like, a moment in between.\n\nhe works from the back of the stage, hiding behind the drums or the amplifiers, waiting for that in-between moment. popping up like a whack-a-mole to get his shot.\n\nand sometimes over the years, it's paid off big, as in this classic photograph. the view from the stage of foo fighter's dave grohl and a cast of thousands.\n\ndanny clinch: it still gives me goose bumps.\n\nor this one, at a pearl jam concert. eddie vedder and jeff ament, airborne.\n\ndanny clinch: i popped up from behind jeff's amplifiers. the whole stadium was lit. they're up in the air in that perfect moment.\n\nanderson cooper: you were hiding behind an amplifier.\n\ndanny clinch: yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: do you wear earplugs?\n\ndanny clinch: i should.\n\nanderson cooper: but you don't.\n\ndanny clinch: i often don't, yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: wow. i'm surprised you can even hear me.\n\ndanny clinch: yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: or are you just reading my lips?\n\ndanny clinch: yeah. it is - i get out there and i'm like, jeez, i should probably have some earplugs. and then i'm like, i forgot them.\n\nlearning the ropes, clinch was an assistant to photographer annie leibovitz. he prefers shooting in natural light, and agrees with what the famous war photographer robert capa said: if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough. and even when he's not working, he's still looking for that perfect shot.\n\ndanny clinch: i'm photographing all the time. i'm such a visual person and i don't want to miss that moment.\n\nanderson cooper: you're never without your camera?\n\ndanny clinch: rarely.\n\nanderson cooper: even right now sitting here?\n\ndanny clinch: yeah. see? i always want to be prepared, 'cause you never know who's going to come to your studio.\n\n[danny clinch: i really like his a lot.]\n\nhis studio is a place where any music fan would love to be locked up for a few days.\n\nanderson cooper: it's like a history of rock and roll.\n\ndanny clinch: there's a couple things here i want to show you so we'll show them over here.\n\na couple years back, he photographed one of the men who started it all: chuck berry, who's now 89. and another founding father: jerry lee lewis, who's 80. and here are some pictures from that first session with bob dylan.\n\ndanny clinch: we were trying to figure out, you know, give him a little something to do. somebody came back with a whole bunch of different language newspapers. and he picked that one up and i started to shoot just, you know, keeping it real simple.\n\nmore of his greatest hits: southern gothic, gregg allman on a rainy day in savannah. johnny cash, waiting to go onstage, a shot capturing the loneliness of life on the road. country stars faith hill and tim mcgraw. tom waits. norah jones. tupac shakur.\n\ndanny clinch: he was really professional and he was into it. we chose a shirt that he was gonna change into. he took his shirt off and i saw all the tattoos. and i said, would you mind doing one like that? and he said yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: when you took this did you know how strong it was?\n\ndanny clinch: i mean, i felt like this was really a powerful image. i felt like the simplicity of it was really powerful.\n\nclinch has branched out into making commercials and music videos. this one shot in willie nelson's bedroom on his tour bus.\n\ndanny clinch: willie doesn't mind me taking his photograph, but he's not really crazy about sitting and being directed and all that sort of stuff. so i've found ways to work with that.\n\nhe also got some very candid stills. nelson braiding his hair. and indulging in his favorite recreational pastime, smoking a huge stick of weed.\n\nanderson cooper: i don't even know what it would be called, it's so big.\n\ndanny clinch: i know, it's something -\n\nanderson cooper: it's like a cigar.\n\ndanny clinch: somehow i can't remember what happened after that.\n\nand then, there are the occasional shoots he wishes he could forget.\n\ndanny clinch: i was at a madonna show many, many years ago and i was in the sweet spot and she came out and i mean it was the best part of the show. and i was shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting. and i'm like, god, i must have shot a hundred pictures have i not run out of film? and i opened the back of my camera and there was no film in there. so that happened to me only once.\n\nanderson cooper: ouch.\n\nno doubt one reason he gets along so well with musicians: he knows the language, wearing yet another hat to play with the tangiers blues band, and sometimes jamming with the likes of willie and bruce. his harmonica, like his camera, goes everywhere he goes.\n\nhe grew up on the jersey shore, living in toms river, a few miles down the garden state parkway from springsteen country.\n\nhe got the photography bug from his mother.\n\ndanny clinch: she always had a camera, always still has a camera. and at times i find myself taking pictures of her taking pictures of the family.\n\nand from his father he got a taste for classic rock and roll from the 50s and classic cars.\n\nhis prize possession: a 1948 pontiac silver streak. the sort of car his father always noticed when clinch was a kid.\n\ndanny clinch: everywhere we went he would go, oh, there's a '55 chevy. and, oh, you know, look at that 1959 cadillac. and i started to love cars myself.\n\nand he's always found a way to work them into the shot. springsteen with the pontiac and in his wife's 1950 hudson with clinch's father at the wheel. an old cadillac with neil young's hat. and young inside, tooling around nashville.\n\ndanny clinch: this was a great moment for me, i'm a big fan of neil's, to be driving around in this cadillac was -\n\nanderson cooper: yeah. was he driving?\n\ndanny clinch: he was driving yeah, yeah. and we stopped at a little intersection and i grabbed it.\n\nbut nothing could prepare him for the trip he made in december to the old car capital of the universe: havana.\n\nanderson cooper: cuba, havana, it's gotta be a photographer's dream.\n\ndanny clinch: i'll tell ya. there's so much interesting culture and there's so much great color, everywhere you look is a photograph.\n\nanderson cooper: you seem to have a smile on your face kind of all the time.\n\ndanny clinch: yeah. yeah.\n\nthe preservation hall jazz band was invited to a cuban music festival, and clinch tagged along with a documentary film crew.\n\nthey play the traditional music of new orleans. a distinctive sound -- and some distinctive instruments.\n\nanderson cooper: you know you do a lot rock and roll bands, don't see a lot of rock and roll bands with a sousaphone.\n\ndanny clinch: yeah. (laugh) that's true.\n\nthe rhythms of new orleans and havana are much alike. and the americans were soon jamming with cuban musicians: on stage, at their homes.\n\ndanny clinch: you don't need to speak spanish, you know? you just need to speak music.\n\nbetween concerts, clinch wandered the city, snapping away. and checking out the cars.\n\ndanny clinch: i'm not just a fan of the really restored ones, the shiny ones. but i like the working man's cars -\n\ndanny clinch: how they've fixed it, how it had been repaired time after time.\n\nbut his biggest thrill came backstage, with the band warming up.\n\ndanny clinch: they were preparing for the show. and it just turned into this impromptu, like jam, this percussion type thing. and i live for those moments.\n\nhe's seen a lot of moments, heard a lot of music. and has come -- to one conclusion.\n\ndanny clinch: it doesn't matter if it's hip-hop. it doesn't matter if it's jazz, or anything in between. if it hits you right here, it's good music.\n\nanderson cooper: and you can get a photo out of it. you can capture it.\n\ndanny clinch: so far, yeah.\n\nwriting in clinch's notebook, tupac shakur said: if a picture is worth a thousand words, photographers are worth a million. that's a thought shared by clinch's fellow native of the jersey shore, who says...\n\nbruce springsteen: this is the man here.\n\n...this is the man.\n\nbruce springsteen: if you want the picture...\n\ndanny clinch: come and get it.\n\nbruce springsteen: there he is.
focus on the family/youtube\n\nthe battle for the super bowl isn't just waged on the field: dozens of advertisers are collectively spending more than $350 million to reach the game's massive audience.\n\nthe super bowl remains a rarity on tv, a broadcast where people tune in not only for the main event but also for the commercials. but that combination -- a huge audience and one that's primed to listen to tv ads -- can sometimes prove to be a mixed blessing for brands, given the enormous pressure to score a touchdown with a memorable ad.\n\nwhen an commercial succeeds, it can both charm viewers and change the way consumers think of a brand. witness apple's 1984 commercial, which broadcast the message that the computer company was breaking away from colorless rivals. but for every 1984, there's at least one advertiser that wants to succeed on a similar scale but falls far short. sometimes, those ads make viewers cringe, spark boycotts or calls for the commercial to be yanked.\n\nthe super bowl 50 advertisers as a whole may swing toward humor this year, contrasting with last year's game, which tended to have a sombre tone, said peter daboll, chief executive of ace metrix.\n\nlast year's group of commercials lost their impact collectively because there were so many serious-minded ads, he noted. i think they will shift back to a more lighter tone to get people to pay attention, to have surprises and not be as preachy.\n\nmerely bad commercials often lose the plot because they're trying to push the envelope, often with humor. one notorious spot came from snickers in 2007, which showed two mechanics snacking on opposite ends of a candy bar, meeting in the middle with a kiss. the men, shocked, try to prove their heterosexuality by tearing out their chest hair and, in one version, fighting. the spot was condemned as homophobic.\n\ncontroversial commercials, on the other hand, often shoot for a big statement but come across as stern, tacky or worse. last year's super bowl included one commercial that left many viewers upset and troubled.\n\nread on to learn about that commercial and four other controversial super bowl ads.\n\nsuper bowl 50 is on sunday, feb. 7 on cbs.
he became the first dreamer to win the prestigious rhodes scholarship, but for recent harvard university graduate jin park, the joy of that achievement has given way to uncertainty.\n\nthe 22-year-old, who lives in new york city, risks not being allowed back in the country if he enrolls at the university of oxford in england in the fall.\n\npresident trump's administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with deferred action for childhood arrivals status, or daca, when mr. trump moved to phase out the obama-era program in 2017.\n\nbut travel abroad, which was allowed under limited circumstances such as academic study during the obama administration, should still be permitted because the federal courts have upheld the program for now, argue park and his supporters.\n\nif i leave, there's a very real possibility that i won't be able to come back. that's the biggest fear for sure, said park, whose family came to the u.s. from south korea when he was 7 years old. i haven't really thought about what that's going to mean if i'm not allowed back.\n\nu.s. citizen and immigration services, which administers daca, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nharvard university grad jin park, who holds a degree in molecular and cellular biology, during interview in cambridge, mass., on dec. 13, 2018 charles krupa / ap\n\ndaca recipients, commonly called dreamers because of never-passed proposals in congress called the dream act, are protected from deportation because they were brought into the country illegally at a young age.\n\ndiscussing the risks has been a delicate topic to broach with his parents, who cried out of joy when he won the scholarship, park said.\n\ni've been avoiding that question, he said days after graduating from harvard last month. this was especially meaningful for them. it was like a validation of the sacrifices they've made for me.\n\nnearly 700,000 individuals are currently on daca, which was created in 2012 and can be renewed every two years. to qualify, immigrants must have entered the country by 2007 and been under age 16 when they arrived.\n\nthe trump administration issued an order winding down the program in 2017, but federal judges in new york, california and washington, d.c., ruled against those efforts last year and have effectively kept the program running. the administration is now seeking a supreme court review.\n\npast rhodes scholars and other rhodes trust supporters are volunteering their private counsel to park in the meantime, but it's a matter of american law and not anything the rhodes trust can resolve alone, said elliot gerson, the british organization's american secretary.\n\nour hope is for federal action, he added.\n\nthe government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow jin to fulfil his scholarly work, said kristian ramos, a spokesman for define american, an immigrant advocacy organization that supported park in his rhodes scholarship bid.\n\npark could turn down the scholarship but has decided against that route. he wants to continue to be a voice in the immigration debate and believes the benefits of going to oxford outweigh the risks.\n\ni'm looking forward to having that unstructured time to think about these broader questions of who belongs in america and the value judgments we make about others, he said.\n\npark has been a vocal advocate for daca recipients since he was in high school. in 2015, he founded higher dreams, a nonprofit organization that helps students without permanent immigration status navigate the college application process.\n\nwith the backing of harvard, park applied for the rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how daca recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. the scholarship was created in 1902 by british businessmen and politician cecil rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at oxford.\n\npark's application - like a number of others in recent years - was rejected, but the message was received. the rhodes organization changed its policy effective this year. park re-applied and was accepted.\n\ngerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. legal permanent residents and residents of u.s. territories like puerto rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years.\n\nat oxford, park hopes to study migration and political theory as he weighs his future.\n\nthe molecular and cell biology major has also applied to medical school, but he hasn't ruled out working in city government, where he believes he can make an impact on immigration policy no matter who is in the white house.\n\nand regardless what happens next, park has the conviction of knowing where home is.\n\nfor me, i think of queens, new york, he said. whatever happens, i'm always going to know that fact. even if i have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next.
jack welch, who became a celebrity ceo and management guru after reviving general electric in the 1980s and 1990s, is dead at age 84.\n\nhis death was confirmed monday by ge, according to the associated press. the cause of death was renal failure, his wife suzy told the new york times.\n\nwelch took over the industrial giant in 1981 at a time when the u.s. economy was emerging from recession and conglomerates were falling out of style among investors. the executive took ge's many industrial divisions global and instituted a management method for better testing the profitability of its divisions, selling off those that were underperforming. that led to higher profits, but also massive layoffs. ge cut more than 100,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its employees, during welch's tenure.\n\nwelch also overhauled ge's business. he led the company's charge into financial services and its purchase of rca, whose assets included the nbc television network.\n\ntoday is a sad day for the entire ge family, current ge chief executive h. lawrence culp jr. said in a statement. jack was larger than life and the heart of ge for half a century. he reshaped the face of our company and the business world. jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him.\n\nin a post on linkedin, jeff immelt, welch's handpicked successor for ge's top job in 2001, called welch the best boss i have ever seen, and said welch made his employees feel valued.\n\njack was always direct, but his frankness was appealing and effective, immelt wrote. his informality and accessibility made ge a team, and we all loved working for him because he wanted the people around him to succeed.\n\ndriving fast growth\n\nwelch's ge makeover was a huge success during his tenure. revenue soared at ge under welch, up 600% to $130 billion. he also made ge's investors a lot of money: general electric's stock market value under welch rose to more than $400 billion, from $14 billion when he took the job of chief executive. during his tenure, ge's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.\n\nthat led to ge becoming the world's most valuable company at one point and its stock one of the most widely held among both institutional and average investors. in 1999, fortune magazine named welch as its manager of the century.\n\nformer general electric ceo jack welch speaks during the world business forum in new york on october 5, 2010. lucas jackson / reuters\n\nwelch, trained as chemical engineer, championed the belief that the main job of a ceo was to boost shareholder wealth. i had plenty of money in the first three years i was ceo — the next 17 was spent making other people rich, welch said two years ago in an interview. i mean it's a turn-on. i used to call guys in my office and give them a million bucks. you realize how good that feels?\n\nreassessing welch's legacy\n\nbut since stepping down from ge's top job in 2001, welch's leadership at the company has come into question, especially since the financial crisis. ge's stock has floundered in recent decades, and the company faced steep losses in its financial businesses after the collapse of lehman brothers. welch also became a vocal critic of president barack obama and other democrats.\n\nin october 2012, welch questioned a monthly government jobs report that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. the report came two days after mr. obama had performed poorly in his first debate with romney and a month before the election.\n\nunbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. these chicago guys will do anything...can't debate so change numbers.\n\nobama hailed from chicago. while some republican members of congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former labor department officials from the bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the government's labor data.\n\nneutron jack\n\nwelch quickly climbed the ranks at ge, becoming its youngest chairman and ceo in 1981 at age 45. he also shook up the company laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. that earned him the unwanted nickname neutron jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact.\n\nwelch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. to that end, he also divested ge of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be no. 1 or 2 in their markets.\n\nhe's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, noel tichy, author of a 1993 book on welch and a former leader of ge's vaunted training programs, said in 2001.\n\nhe'll make snap judgments; he's a human being that has temper tantrums. tichy said. with all that, i think he's the greatest business leader i ever met.\n\n— the associated press contributed to this report.
a priority of the new president and congress will be reining in the giants of social media. on this, democrats and republicans agree. their target is a federal law known as section 230. in a single sentence it set off the 'big bang' helping to create the universe of google, facebook, twitter and the rest. some critics of the law say that it leaves social media free to ignore lies, hoaxes and slander that can wreck the lives of innocent people. one of those critics is lenny pozner. after a tragedy in his own life, pozner has become a champion for victims of online lies, people including maatje and matt benassi, who, overnight, became the target of death threats like these.\n\nmaatje benassi: we're gonna put a bullet in her skull. let's load up the trucks. let's go get 'em. let's hang 'em. they posted our address, our full address, where we live.\n\nthe hate focused on maatje and matt benassi, was unleashed by a hoax that claims she brought covid-19 into the world.\n\nmatt benassi: it's changed and migrated over the 70-plus videos that they've had about us. but--\n\nscott pelley: wait. seventy?\n\nmatt benassi: yeah. if you actually go through all of the videos there is a total 70 videos across multiple youtube channels.\n\nmaatje and matt benassi\n\nthe videos claim maatje benassi carried the virus to china on a bicycle. she was invited there as a member of a u.s. military cycling team. maatje is a dutch immigrant, american citizen and solider who served in iraq. in 2019, during an international military olympics, she crashed in wuhan, where covid-19 was discovered two months later. her collision with the internet began after an innocent article about the race.\n\nmaatje benassi: and somebody came across it, and it had wuhan in it, and they took a run with it. oh, we got a person.\n\nscott pelley: your name, the name wuhan, and the rest only takes a lot of imagination.\n\nmaatje benassi: correct.\n\nscott pelley: what were they saying about you?\n\nmaatje benassi: first they said i brought it to china. and when i crashed, i spread it. and that i spread it in the hospital which i never was in a hospital. all these lies about vials in my bicycle hidden. and i have no idea.\n\nthe absurdity was spelled out, literally, by a hoax peddler named george webb. he has a following among the deep state phony conspiracy crowd.\n\nscott pelley: what has this meant to you?\n\nmaatje benassi: i was looking over my shoulder a lot. i was scared for my life\n\nscott pelley: you were taking all that seriously?\n\nmaatje benassi: yes. once my address was posted, that was it for me. that did it. because they put me in danger, my family.\n\nmatt benassi: there was like 60 or 70 death threats over the span of, you know, four or five weeks.\n\nthey called the police and the fbi which got them nowhere.\n\nmatt benassi: and the reason why the fbi and the police don't want to talk to you is because even though we're receiving death threats they didn't say, we're coming to the benassis to kill them tonight.\n\nscott pelley: they need a crime to have been committed.\n\nmatt benassi: that's correct.\n\nscott pelley: and you're trying to prevent a crime from being committed.\n\nmatt benassi: absolutely.\n\nright about now you might be thinking, they should sue. but that's the problem. they can't file hundreds of lawsuits against internet trolls hiding behind aliases. and they can't sue the internet platforms because of that law known as section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996. written before facebook or google were invented, section 230 says, in just 26 words, that internet platforms are not liable for what their users post.\n\njeff kosseff\n\njeff kosseff: that means that if i were to post something about you on facebook that was awful and defamatory and you actually had a viable defamation lawsuit, you could sue me, but you can't sue facebook.\n\njeff kosseff teaches law and wrote a book called the 26 words that created the internet.\n\nscott pelley: but help me understand, the same is not true for other forms of media. if somebody says something defamatory on 60 minutes or on fox or cnn or in the new york times, those organizations can be sued. so why not google, youtube, facebook?\n\njeff kosseff: so the difference between a social media site and let's say the letters to the editor page of the new york times is the vast amount of content that they deliver. so i mean you might have five or ten letters to the editor on a page. you could have i think it's 6,000 tweets per second. and so section 230 really recognizes how exceptional the internet is and says, we want to encourage this marketplace of ideas. 25 years later, that marketplace has a lot of really great stuff, but it also has a lot of really terrible products in that marketplace. and that's really what's driving this debate right now.\n\nmaatje and matt benassi quickly discovered the law was not on their side so they turned to lenny pozner who had suffered in the same way.\n\nlenny pozner: i was being attacked, the memory of my son, my son's very short life was being attacked. and i just wasn't going to stand for that.\n\nthe very short life of pozner's son, noah, ended at connecticut's sandy hook elementary school in 2012, with 25 others. the gunshots of a madman have ricocheted online ever since.\n\nlenny pozner: conversations denying the tragedy-- accusing the government of staging it.\n\nscott pelley: what was the most hurtful thing they said about you?\n\nlenny pozner: that noah did not die. that i'm not noah's father. it all revolves around the notion that these are staged shootings, that they're scripted events, that i'm an actor, that i'm paid to fake the death of a child.\n\nbefore the covid pandemic we hired theatrical makeup artists to disguise pozner for his safety. he's pursued by death threats. one woman left a voicemail saying, death is coming for you real soon. she landed in prison sooner.\n\nscott pelley: how many times have you had to move your family?\n\nlenny pozner: around seven times.\n\nlenny pozner in theatrical makeup to disguise himself for safety.\n\nhe's targeted because he's invented ways to fight back. he copyrighted photos of his son to control how they are used. he published a letter to facebook's ceo that read, [you] have deemed… our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.\n\nscott pelley: this was meant by you and your ex-wife to be public shaming of facebook?\n\nlenny pozner: that has been really the only effective way to get change for online platforms.\n\nafter the letter, a facebook manager called pozner.\n\nlenny pozner: it began a relationship with facebook that helped them learn about the material that is being posted on their platform and how it is abusive, defamatory\n\nscott pelley: have you seen a difference, a practical difference in facebook?\n\nlenny pozner: yes, it's almost all gone.\n\npozner expanded his work into a non-profit called the honr network—that applies what he has learned to help others.\n\nandy parker: that's when i reached out to lenny pozner, he had volunteers that were fighting harassment-- and i said, lenny, i want this video to come down. and he said, i will help you do that.\n\nandy parker\n\nby himself, andy parker couldn't get video of his daughter's murder off of google's youtube.\n\nandy parker: i really expected them to do the right thing. their motto was, don't be evil. and for a while, they did a pretty good job of it. but now, they are the personification of evil.\n\nin 2015, reporter alison parker and cameraman, adam ward, were shot, on camera, by a fired co-worker. the scene has been posted hundreds of times. this one got more than 600,000 views. and to the right, the automatic ad means the person who posted this made money and so did youtube.\n\nandy parker: we shouldn't have to be the ones policing their platform. their terms of service say, we don't allow this. we don't allow violent content. we don't allow harassment. my biggest beef with google, and youtube, and facebook for that matter is, that video is still out there. it's still out there today in essence, they profit from my daughter's murder. and i can't abide by that.\n\nscott pelley: do you worry about threats?\n\nandy parker: no, i really don't.\n\nscott pelley: why do you feel so brave?\n\nandy parker: because alison would expect nothing less.\n\nscott pelley: you're still her dad.\n\nandy parker: yeah, i'm her dad. always will be, and i will fight like hell-- for her.\n\nlenny pozner flagged alison parker videos for youtube to remove.\n\nyoutube wrote us, there is no place on youtube for content that exploits this horrendous act, and we've spent the last several years investing in tools and policies to quickly remove it. youtube told us it now prioritizes all requests from pozner's honr network.\n\nscott pelley: why do you think the online platforms have not been effective in enforcing their own terms of service?\n\nlenny pozner: i don't think they were prepared for their online platforms to be used this way. i think they were more focused on growth and expansion and likely had more of an idealized notion of the internet and the way it would be used for the greater good.\n\nscott pelley: an idealized notion of human nature?\n\nlenny pozner: yeah, well, yes.\n\npozner also has been successful pulling down much of that covid-19 lie that shadows maatje and matt benassi. he got hoax peddler george webb kicked off youtube.\n\nrecently, some platforms took first steps toward editing their users. facebook and twitter flagged dubious content during the election. now they're doing the same for myths about covid-19.\n\nscott pelley: based on what you've had to learn about all of these things, what do you think the solution could be?\n\nmatt benassi: this is really, really hard, right? 'cause section 230. when that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner. and social media companies haven't done that very well. they need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in and figure out some mechanism to make them liable. 'cause making them liable would make them police themselves.\n\nbut making social media liable would also mean facebook, twitter, even wikipedia and yelp, couldn't exist as we know them. president-elect biden wants to revoke section 230. the federal government is already suing to break up facebook and google. no one can say what social media 2.0 will look like or whether the innocent will ever be protected from a world wide web of lies.\n\nproduced by henry schuster. associate producer, sarah turcotte and rachael kun morehouse. broadcast associate, ian flickinger. edited by warren lustig.

charlottesville -- in a deal that spares him the death penalty, jesse matthew has pleaded guilty to the murders of two virginia college students as family members of the victims read emotional impact statements.\n\nwatch: 48 hours: hannah graham: deadly connections\n\nduring a wednesday court hearing, the former hospital orderly pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and two counts of abduction with intent to defile in the september 2014 death of 18-year-old university of virginia student hannah graham and the 2009 death of 20-year-old virginia ech student morgan harrington. matthew, 35, made no statement to the judge and showed little emotion.\n\njesse matthew arriving in court wednesday, march 2, 2016 wdbj reporter joe dashiell via twitter\n\na sentence of four consecutive life terms was accepted by the judge, in addition to the three he's already serving in a 2005 fairfax, va. rape. capital murder - a charge which carries a possible death sentence - was taken off the table.\n\nmatthew has expressed remorse for the killings, his lawyer douglas ramseur said at a press conference following the hearing.\n\nhe had me express for him in court how terribly sorry he is for everything that's happened, and how much he loves his family and is sorry for everything they've been put through because of this, ramseur said.\n\nspeaking before the judge, hannah graham's mother sue graham called her daughter a heroine who helped change the world.\n\nshe helped capture a serial rapist and murderer who had been hiding in plain sight in charlottesville for years, graham said.\n\nshe said matthew dumped her like a bag of trash to be picked over by buzzards.\n\ndescribing hannah as irreplaceable and the most optimistic person we've ever known, she said she misses her daughter's smile and quick wit, and snuggling with her on the couch.\n\nharrington's father dan harrington also spoke before the judge, reading a statement prepared by his family, reports cbs affiliate wtvr.\n\nharrington described his daughter morgan as beautiful, smart and talented. he said he and his family have felt the pain of their daughter's loss acutely, every second, of every day in the 6.5 years since that wicked act occurred.\n\nhe said matthew robbed his family of morgan and our joy, and robbed his daughter of her future, her potential to educate others, to be married, have children and to grow old.\n\nour little girl, morgan was killed by jesse matthew. how can that be? the brutality and intentionality of morgan's murder pierces our every day, and will continue to do so until we join her, his statement read.\n\nhow could he? why would he?\n\naccording to authorities, graham and harrington were young women in vulnerable straits when they vanished in charlottesville five years apart. harrington disappeared after she stepped out of a u.va. arena during a metallica concert and was unable to get back in. graham, after having dinner and attending parties off campus, was captured on surveillance video walking unsteadily, and sometimes running, past a service station and a restaurant. she texted a friend that she was lost.\n\nadditional video showed graham crossing charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, then leaving a restaurant with matthew, his arm wrapped around her.\n\nthe surveillance images of matthew meeting their daughter will stay in the family's mind's forever, sue graham said wednesday.\n\ngraham's disappearance, which came at a time of rising national concern about sexual assaults and other crimes on college campuses, prompted a massive search. her body was found five weeks later on abandoned property in albemarle county, about 12 miles from the charlottesville campus and 6 miles from a hayfield where harrington's remains had been found in january 2010.\n\nafter police named matthew a person of interest in graham's disappearance, he fled and was later apprehended on a beach in southeast texas. he was charged with abduction with intent to defile, a felony that empowered police to swab his cheek for a dna sample. that sample connected matthew to the 2005 sexual assault in fairfax, a virginia suburb of washington, according to authorities.\n\nthe dna evidence in the fairfax sexual assault, in turn, linked matthew to the harrington case, authorities have said.\n\nthe charge against matthew in the graham case was later upgraded to capital murder, giving prosecutors the option to seek the death penalty.\n\nmatthew, who was a taxi driver before going to work at the university of virginia hospital, also had been accused of raping students in 2002 and 2003 at liberty university and christopher newport university, where he had played football. but those cases were dropped when the women declined to press charges.
consumers, get ready: you're about to suffer some sticker shock. thanks to the post-election surge of business optimism, last year's rebound in energy prices and a tightening labor market, we learned this week that inflation measures are already rising at the fastest pace since 2013.\n\nheadline consumer price inflation jumped 0.6 percent month-over-month -- double the expected gain. on an annual basis, inflation is rising at a 2.5 percent clip (the hottest since march 2012).\n\nshould these trends continue, as they appear ready to do, shoppers are going to suffer a surge of higher prices not seen since the end of the last economic expansion in 2007.\n\nit's not just inflation, but real growth is heating up as well. and that means the inflation surge is no mere flash in the pan.\n\nheadline retail sales rose 0.4 percent in january over december, pushing the annual rise to a level that was last hit in 2014. and the february empire state manufacturing survey increased to its strongest print since september 2014.\n\nseparately, producer price inflation increased 0.6 percent last month from the month prior, double the gain expected and landing the annual rate at 1.6 percent -- another level not seen since 2014. you get the idea.\n\ndigging into the consumer price index (cpi, chart above), energy is playing a big role, with gasoline prices up 7.8 percent as we eclipse last february's energy price wipeout before opec started teasing a production freeze agreement that was eventually finalized late last year. but other areas of upward price pressure include apparel, new vehicles, household furnishings, housing and medical care. so the forces are broad-based.\n\nshelter costs in particular are a big deal because they're heavily weighted in inflation measures (at about a third of overall spending) and have been rising steadily in recent years. the cpi's shelter component is rising at a 3.5 percent annual rate -- last hit in the fading days of the housing bubble in 2007.\n\ntwo dynamics threaten to precipitate the inflation surge: the long-awaited rise of wage pressure and the ability of businesses to pass higher costs onto consumers via higher prices.\n\nwages certainly look poised for a move higher, assuming the tepid but steady payroll gains continue. the national federation of independent business survey found a growing shortage of qualified, desirable applicants. the latest numbers show the net share of small companies saying they're receiving inadequate applicants for job postings rose to 47 percent from 44 percent in december.\n\nshould this hiring tightness translate into higher pay as businesses compete for a diminished pool of quality workers, the temptation to protect profitability will be hard to resist.\n\nso far, this dynanmic isn't hitting consumers: only 5 percent of nfib respondents said they're raising prices. but that could soon change.

as if it weren't tough enough to get a date as you get older, dating site tinder also charges more if you're over 30. but now a california appeals court has revived a lawsuit that alleges tinder's pricing discriminates against older users, who must pay more to access certain features of its service. that ruling was a reversal of a lower-court decision.\n\nat issue is tinder's 2015 decision to charge customers 30 and older a $19.99 monthly fee for its tinder plus feature, for which younger people pay $9.99 to $14.99. plaintiff allen candelore filed suit seeking class-action status against tinder, alleging the company's pricing constituted unfair competition and violated california's unruh civil rights act. a spokesperson for tinder couldn't be reached.\n\nthe service, where people swipe right on their smartphones to accept a potential match, is part of the internet company match, also the corporate parent of match.com and okcupid. tinder plus allows users to change their location so they can find potential dates anywhere in the world and a rewind feature that lets users undo a left-swipe reject.\n\ntinder, which claims more than 26 million matches every day, charged lower rates for younger consumers because its market research showed that they were less able to afford premium services. a three-judge panel of the los angeles county superior court, however, rejected tinder's justification for the difference in charges.\n\nno matter what tinder's market research may have shown about the younger users' relative income and willingness to pay for the service, as a group, as compared to the older cohort, some individuals will not fit the mold, the 26-page ruling said. some older consumers will be 'more budget constrained' and less willing to pay than some in the younger group. … because nothing in the complaint suggests there is a strong public policy that justifies the alleged discriminatory pricing. … accordingly, we swipe left, and reverse.\n\ncandelore has been involved in other high-profile lawsuits. he is a member of the nonprofit national coalition for men (ncfm), which seeks to raise awareness about how men and boys are affected by sex discrimination. mother jones reported in 2016 that candelore and two other ncfm members filed suit in california against business networking and golf events in recent years that were open only to women. both cases were later settled for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nal rava, who represents candelore in the tinder case, also served as counsel in the networking and golf course cases. he has cited the unruh act in many of the more than 150 discrimination cases he has filed over the past decade, including a challenge to an oakland athletics' giveaway of baseball hats to female fans that was eventually settled.\n\nin fact, i have been victorious in all my unruh civil rights act sex-discrimination lawsuits because, as a result of these lawsuits, every defendant stopped its unequal treatment of male and female consumers,' rava said. he added that the tinder lawsuit isn't related to the ncfm.
president donald trump has always linked illegal immigration to the southern border and the need for a wall. on thursday — the 13th day of a government shutdown tied to the issue — mr. trump tweeted a video called crisis on the border depicting rioting migrants trying to rush into the country.\n\nbut only one-third of the recent undocumented immigrant population came to the united states through the southern border, according to the center for migration studies (cms), a new york city-based think tank. the rest came legally on work visas and stayed after they expired, according to cms.\n\nin other words, a wall wouldn't have kept them out.\n\naccording to cms, about 42 percent of the 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the u.s. in 2014 — the most recent year for which data was available — were doing so on expired visas. as the southern border has hardened, that number is estimated to have risen to over half, randy capps, director of research for u.s. programs at the migration policy institute, said.\n\nthe fight over a border wall is a typical issue of 'fighting the last war': ten years ago was the fight against mexican migration to the u.s., capps said in a telephone interview with cbs news. the problem isn't mexican migration anymore. now the immigration problem is overstayers, not border crossers.\n\nthe undocumented immigrant population hit a 12-year low in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, almost entirely due to a sharp drop in unauthorized border crossings by mexican nationals, according to the pew research center. pew estimated that the unauthorized mexican immigrant population decreased by 22 percent since its peak in 2007.\n\nover a five-year period ending 2016, a little over half a million mexicans illegally entered the u.s. through the southern border. that was down from 2.05 million during five years ending 2007, according to pew.\n\nwhile there has been an increase in central american migrants arriving at the southern border recently, a vast majority have claimed asylum, a legal mode of immigration, said capps.\n\nmr. trump has made immigration, specifically a border wall, a signature piece of his administration's priorities. while there have been some measures to rein in visa overstays since mr. trump was sworn into office, the changes have been less resource-draining.\n\none such change is that immigration customs and enforcement now emails visa holders to warn them that their legal residency is about to expire, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies, a research group that supports policy which admits fewer immigrants.\n\nit'll make people think twice about staying, vaughan said in a telephone interview with cbs news. i think it'll help.\n\nin the year ending september 30, 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, about 700,000 foreigners were living in the u.s. on visas that had expired in the prior 12 months, according to data from the department of homeland security. the agency estimated that about 15 percent of those have since left the country, but the rest remain in the u.s. as undocumented immigrants. 2017 was only the second year that dhs reported the overstay figure.\n\nlike most other immigration data points, pinpointing the total undocumented population and how they arrived in the u.s. is equal parts art and science, vaughan said. using deportation data from ice, which tracks how immigrants arrive in the u.s., vaughan estimates that visa overstays comprise somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the undocumented immigration population.\n\nboth modes of entry are a big problem, said vaughan.
produced by alec sirken, marc goldbaum, paul larosa, chris young ritzen, james stolz and aimee desimone.\n\nit's friday night in quincy, illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team.\n\nthe quincy high school blue devils is a revered, legendary program. one of the winningest programs in high school history, said local journalist bob gough, who swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as the announcer.\n\nif you're a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you, he said.\n\nand no one was bigger than blue devil's hall of famer curtis lovelace. in the 1980s, he made headlines as a star athlete and scholar at quincy high school.\n\ncurtis lovelace was a star student athlete at quincy high school\n\ncurtis lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid, said gough.\n\nand the university of illinois gave lovelace - #54 -- a scholarship to play football.\n\ni mean quincy, illinois, doesn't produce a ton of all-big ten players, gough noted.\n\nhe wasn't just any player. lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the big ten -- a team captain who lead the university of illinois to the big ten championship his senior year.\n\nwas two-time all-big ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the nfl, gough explained. had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. but being a smart kid curtis already had other goals in mind.\n\nwhile at school, curtis started a long distance relationship with cory didriksen. they met in high school, but only started dating when they left for college. she was studying communications at the university of iowa.\n\nshe just had a perfect smile, cory's mother, marty didriksen, told cbs affiliate khqa. and she just smiled at everyone. and she just did stuff.\n\ncory was vibrant, dynamic. a little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and i loved her for that. i think that was her most endearing quality, said friend steve belko.\n\nbelko, beth dobrzynski and bret schrader grew up with cory and curtis in quincy.\n\ncurt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent - a gentlemen, said belko.\n\ndo you think they were well matched? maher asked the group of friends.\n\ni did. i did. well, they looked great together, but they had a lot of similarities and they seemed to have fun together, dobrzynski replied.\n\nit didn't take long before their relationship became serious.\n\nit was thanksgiving. we were sitting up on her bed. and we were just kinda talking about things and she said, 'oh, by the way, i've met the man i'm going to marry,' said didriksen.\n\ncurtis and cory lovelace marty didriksen\n\nin 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married. belko was curt's best man and dobrzynski was cory's bridesmaid.\n\nit was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said belko.\n\ncory was beautiful. it was a great night. they were very happy. the pictures you know, you could see on their faces. whether it was cutting the cake or dancing or walking around and talking to people. it was a magical night, dobrzynski reminisced.\n\nwith cory by his side, curtis lovelace had grand plans. he attended law school and eventually became an assistant state's attorney in the city they both loved, quincy.\n\nwhat did cory want to do with her life? ... what were her dreams? maher asked dobrzynski.\n\ncory was all about family. she had a great childhood growing up, she replied. she wanted the big family. ...the happy marriage.\n\nthe lovelace family marty didriksen\n\nthat dream came true in 1993, when their first child, lyndsay, was born. they would later have three sons: logan, lincoln, and larson.\n\nshe was a beautiful person, lyndsay lovelace said of her mother.\n\nlyndsay, now 22, told khqa reporter jenny dreasler how she and her mother loved listening to the music group abba.\n\nwe would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'dancing queen.' i still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said.\n\nlyndsay's dad was a man on the move. in 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. and, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, lovelace was elected president of the school board. he became a captain in the illinois national guard, and an adjunct professor at quincy university.\n\nhe definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, gough remarked.\n\nbut friends say with power, came ego.\n\ni just felt he kinda started to talk down to me more and more each time i saw him, said schrader.\n\nwas he arrogant? maher asked.\n\nhe became arrogant more and more, yes, belko said. there was a little bit of holier than thou. ...maybe you were entitled to this living. i think he lost friends over time because of that.\n\nthe situation at home had also been changing. while curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the long hours away from cory and the kids were starting to take a toll on their personal life.\n\nfrom what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said gough.\n\nneighbors around the lovelace house on kentucky street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between cory and curtis. by many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. and in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.\n\nshe suffered from bulimia. this is something her family has admitted, dreasler said. and the rumors started coming out. ...known alcoholism. the community knew that too. there've been people who've even told me ... i saw her out drinking here or out drinking there. people knew that she had an alcohol problem, but i don't think that they knew to the extent.\n\ncory and curtis lovelace steve belko\n\namazingly, curtis and cory managed to keep their problems from their closest friends, like belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.\n\nwas there a point in time where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? maher asked the friends.\n\nno, said belko.\n\nno indication that there was trouble coming up? maher asked.\n\ni never had any, belko replied.\n\ncory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under control. and she wasn't one to you know whine or complain, dobrzynski said. she could handle it.\n\nbut everything fell apart on valentine's day 2006, when belko got a call from curtis's father that cory had died.\n\nhe said, 'listen i got some bad news.' ...and i just couldn't believe it. no, that doesn't happen. she's my age. she's healthy. this just doesn't come from nowhere, belko said. something's wrong. there was no doubt something is terribly wrong.\n\nvalentine's day mystery\n\non feb. 14, 2006, love was in the crisp winter air of quincy, illinois. at 1869 kentucky, it was a school day and cory lovelace would usually have her hands full.\n\ncory was a stay at home mom, gough explained. she was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.\n\nthat morning seemed like so many others. according to curtis lovelace, cory helped get the kids ready. they had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. it was 8:15 a.m.\n\ncurtis then took the three oldest children to school, gough said. they left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there.\n\nand little 4-year-old larson went upstairs to see his mom.\n\nwent in and he said that he said her name and he thought he poked her. but she didn't answer, dreasler explained. so he ... sat and waited for his dad to get home.\n\nthen when he got back, the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't wake his mom up, said gough.\n\nby then, it was about 9 a.m.\n\ncurt went upstairs to use the restroom and glanced back in the bedroom and saw something wasn't right. went in to see cory, tried to shake her. and nothing, said belko.\n\nthat was the moment a normal valentine's day morning turned into a mystery. behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with curtis lovelace.\n\ntook the youngest to cory's mother's house. gave the youngest child to cory's mother and said, 'cory's dead' and left, gough said. the first call was not to 911. the first call was not to the paramedics. the first call was his boss, the state's attorney.\n\nstill strikes you as odd, maher noted.\n\nvery much so, said gough.\n\nwho walks over to their mother-in-law's house, gives them their youngest ... and says, 'your daughter's dead, here's my child. take care of him,' maher commented.\n\nthe whole scenario was bizarre, said gough.\n\nwas curtis lovelace in shock?\n\npeople do process grief differently, sure. if it was my wife, i think i'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to perform cpr, which he didn't do, said gough.\n\nthe grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. e.m.t cole miller was among the first on the scene.\n\nshe was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how cory's were positioned. and i went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.\n\nit was just surreal, said dobrzynski.\n\nwhen i did find out i was very shocked, said schrader.\n\nwhat happened in the house that morning, when it happened -- just how long cory lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would haunt a town and destroy a family.\n\nshe'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start cpr. it wouldn't do any good, said miller.\n\nquincy police detective jeff baird would not speak to 48 hours. but that day he did speak with curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning curtis swears to police and to friends, cory was still very much alive.\n\nwhat did he say happened? maher asked steve belko.\n\nthat cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some tylenol and he got her some, he explained. apparently she did come down to help. he told me he just remembers her at the bottom of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to school.\n\naccording to curtis, his wife cory was not feeling well that valentine's day morning. she came down the stairs and sat down for a while. detective baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning.\n\nhe interviewed the three oldest children. those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. he just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. and they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said gough.\n\nwhy is the time cory lovelace died so critical? ask a man who deals in death for a living, deputy coroner james keller. that valentine's day morning, he was there to transport cory's body.\n\nupon entering the bedroom, i notice the female lying on the bed on her back with her hands kind of in an upright position, keller explained.\n\ncan you show me? maher asked.\n\nhands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in front of his chest. kind of this direction here ... a very odd position.\n\nhowever long cory lovelace had been dead, to keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in -- a process he says usually takes close to 12 hours.\n\nshe was in the state of full rigor, said keller.\n\nfull rigor? maher asked.\n\nfull rigor, he affirmed.\n\nalmost like a mannequin? maher asked.\n\ncorrect.\n\nfully stiff?\n\nfully stiff.\n\nkeller was told that cory saw the kids off to school, handing one a valentine's class project. and someone on the scene told keller cory lovelace had died in the morning.\n\nkeller's response to that was, what day?\n\ndid it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning? maher asked.\n\nit did not, keller said. it just didn't seem to add up.\n\nover the years, james keller has learned one undeniable truth of his trade: the dead do speak.\n\na body always tells a story the way you find them, he said.\n\nwhat is the story that cory's body was telling you? maher asked.\n\nthat she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, keller replied.\n\nten to 12 hours earlier, possibly?\n\ncorrect. yes ma'am, keller affirmed.\n\nbut that medical assessment of time of death wasn't matching what curtis and the kids were saying -- that cory has been alive that morning.\n\nit was just not what she was telling. it was just not what she was saying, said keller.\n\ndid you tell anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? maher asked.\n\nthere's numerous people ... the coroner gary hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns.\n\njames keller was a deputy coroner at the time, second to sitting coroner gary hamilton, who was also at the lovelace home. an autopsy, including toxicology test, was conducted the day after cory was found dead, and hamilton signed off. the cause of death was undetermined.\n\nwell 'undetermined' ... if you don't have a cause ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the right thing to do, said keller.\n\ndespite the odd position of cory's arms and despite an unexplained cut on her lip, two days later, at her mother's request, cory lovelace was cremated and quincy police officially closed the investigation.\n\nand life went on? maher asked gough.\n\nyeah, he said.\n\nnobody cared to look deeper?\n\nnope.\n\neight years would pass, and then a curious cop followed a hunch.\n\nyou had a detective in the quincy police department, adam gibson, gough explained.\n\nand lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with cory's body bein' in that condition, it just -- it just didn't make sense to me, said det. gibson.\n\na fresh look at the case\n\nwithin six months after the mysterious death of his wife, cory, on valentine's day 2006, curtis lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at quincy university. the woman, named erica, was eight years his junior. they married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, lyndsay, didn't get along. lyndsay became estranged from her father.\n\nlyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. why, i don't know, said steve belko.\n\nlyndsay then moved out of her father's house and in with her grandmother marty didriksen, cory's mom.\n\ncurt chose his second wife over his daughter, said belko.\n\nmarriage number two fell apart in 2013.\n\nbut once again, curtis lovelace didn't stay single for long. he got married for a third time months after his divorce in 2013, this time to his current wife, christine, whom he had known in high school and reconnected with years later.\n\nchristine and curtis lovelace christine lovelace\n\nhe is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, compassionate, wonderful husband, she told 48 hours. we're actually best friends.\n\nwhile the end of 2013 marked a new beginning for curtis and christine ...\n\nwe'd go on dates not typical of romantic date nights -- eat fried chicken, go across the bridge to missouri, have hot fudge sundaes with extra cherries, she said.\n\n... it was around that same time that a newly-promoted detective at the quincy police department, adam gibson, took a fresh look at cory's death.\n\nsometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said det. gibson.\n\nand i was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the lovelace case popped into my head, he said.\n\nthe more det. gibson read about the 8-year-old case, the more he was intrigued.\n\nwhat in that file made you say, 'huh, i'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? maureen maher asked the detective.\n\njust the general description of the position of her hands, he replied.\n\nand when you saw the pictures, what was your first reaction?\n\nit did not appear to me that could've been a natural death, said det. gibson.\n\na drawing by artist bill beard of a graphic photo of cory lovelace\n\nthe pictures show cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air.\n\nthat didn't really make sense, and there was no real explanation for 'em, said det. gibson.\n\ngibson consulted king county coroner james keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006.\n\nit bothered me for years, said keller.\n\nso when you found out that detective gibson was moving forward, what was your reaction? maher asked.\n\ni think it -- it is definitely time to open, keller replied.\n\ndetective gibson kept investigating the old case secretly, out of the public eye. he consulted the original pathologist, dr. jessica bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. bowman told gibson she would no longer participate in the case, but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in chicago, dr. shaku teas.\n\nshe said basically that she saw nothing suspicious about the death, det. gibson said of dr. tea's ruling.\n\nso why wasn't that the end of it for you? i mean, you have dr. bowman who says undetermined, you have now dr. shaku teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, i don't see a problem with it,' maher asked the detective.\n\nbecause i didn't believe that the information that dr. teas had given was credible to what i already knew, he replied.\n\nso det. gibson sought yet another opinion. enter dr. jane turner, an assistant medical examiner in st. louis.\n\nwhat do you remember as the first thing that struck you about that file? was there anything in there that you looked at and said, 'well, that's interesting,' maher asked dr. turner.\n\nyes. it was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. they were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.\n\ncould you show me, put ... my arms in the position that you saw cory lovelace's body in while she was laying down still in the bed? maher asked dr. turner.\n\nso she was on her back. and her arms were like this. a little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.\n\nand-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? maher asked.\n\nwell, that more time has passed than the witness stated, dr. turner replied.\n\nthe witness being curtis lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead.\n\nin my report, i stated 10 to 12 hours. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said dr. turner.\n\nbased on the photos, the autopsy report and police reports, dr. turner pinpointed the cause of death: suffocation at the hands of another.\n\nwhat did you determine would have caused the suffocation? maher asked.\n\nwell, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. ...and it appears that there is a pillow missing, dr. turner replied. so i suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her.\n\nwhile det. gibson had a new timeline and a cause of death, he also had one big problem. remember, the three oldest lovelace children insisted they saw their mother alive that morning, sitting on the stairs.\n\nthe one thing i do know is, the science of cory lovelace doesn't match that story, said gibson.\n\ngibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, jeff baird, until two days after their mother's death. but if curtis lovelace did kill his wife the night before, as dr. turner believes, what was his motive?\n\nwas there a life insurance policy, maher ask gough.\n\n...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.\n\nwas he having an affair?\n\ni have not heard that, said gough.\n\nso what's the motive? what does he gain? maher asked.\n\n...he told one of the witnesses that their last 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, gough replied.\n\npeople fight and argue all the time, maher noted to det. gibson.\n\nthat's true, he said.\n\nhow did it lead to murder in this situation? maher asked.\n\nthat's the million-dollar question, det. gibson replied.\n\na new detective ... found a doctor to give him the answer he was looking for. there's not one bit of evidence ... that cory ... was murdered, said christine lovelace.\n\nhow certain are you now that curtis lovelace murdered his wife, cory?\n\ni'm 100 percent certain. the science tells me that, said det. gibson.\n\na battle of experts\n\nin august 2014, eight years after the death of cory lovelace, curtis lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when police confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's murder.\n\nnobody had any idea that this was, this was happening. none of the local media, said khqa reporter jenny dreasler.\n\nthe same day as a grand jury indictment comes down, he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed right outside his law office and taken down to booking, said local journalist bob gough.\n\na good friend who works for a news station in quincy, he texted me ... said 'christine, curt's been arrested for cory's murder,' christine lovelace told 48 hours. i said,'that makes no sense, cory was not murdered.'\n\nthere was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said.\n\nthe former golden boy would spend the next 17 months in jail, held on $5 million bond.\n\ni was a little stunned, friend steve belko said. he looked old, haggard. something i'd never seen before.\n\ncurtis lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago.\n\na decade after cory lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the adams county courthouse. after hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: do they believe cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?\n\nsome of the jurors who would decide curtis' fate spoke with 48 hours.\n\nand by show of hands, how many of you knew curtis lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? maher asked the group. four of the six jurors raised their hands. ok, so a majority of who are here.\n\nis it the trial of century in quincy? maher asked gough. yes, he replied.\n\nand why is that, just because of who he is?\n\nyes. absolutely, gough replied. i mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall.\n\nquincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops.\n\ni don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 hours.\n\nthe prosecution laid out its dramatic case -- that curtis lovelace smothered his wife, cory, the mother of his four children, with a pillow the night before valentine's day.\n\njurors heard from world-renowned pathologist dr. michael baden and dr. jane turner. they both testified that cory had to have died the night before.\n\nit's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. she had drying artifact of her eyes. again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, dr. turner told maher. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position ... suggests to me that she was in full rigor.\n\nthe prosecution uses dr. turner to explain how a cut found during the autopsy on cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.\n\nthere's a bruise on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. and that's from blunt force trauma. so some forceful pressure was applied to the mouth, she explained.\n\nbut then, in this battle of the experts, the defense counters with their own, dr. george nichols. he says cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.\n\ni think she died as a result of natural diseases related to her liver disease. but the corroborative tests to confirm that were not performed, so i cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said dr. nichols.\n\nmy opinion is, there's no proof that this woman was murdered, he said.\n\nand as to dr. turner's claim that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?\n\nas i said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not occur at a specific, fixed time. there's huge variability from person to person, dr. nichols stated.\n\nfurther, he said, dr. turner was only working from photos -- she never actually saw cory's body in person.\n\nand as to that single cut on cory's lip? nonsense, says dr. nichols.\n\nthat's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner surface of her lips, he told 48 hours.\n\nbut she did have that one injury, a 48 hours producer pointed out.\n\none. not multiple. how many teeth do i have? dr. nichols said, showing his teeth. ok? each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as i'm fighting back against someone who's holding a pillow over me.\n\nif the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark contrast to the testimony of the lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.\n\nthe kids will be in my mind probably forever, said juror theresa tarr.\n\nthe prosecution called the youngest son, larson, who was 4 years old at the time of his mother's death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to wake her up. juror theresa tarr was struck by the image.\n\nit was an emotional testimony, she said. thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.\n\nmy children have dealt with enough pain in their life for them to feel any kind of pain, an emotional christine lovelace said.\n\nthen, the defense called the two older sons, logan, now 18, and dressed in his military uniform, and lincoln, now 17. a normally stoic curtis breaks down when each of the two older boys takes the stand, recounting how curtis came to school that day to tell them their mother had died.\n\nnews report: this is the first day we saw any real emotion out of curtis lovelace as he broke down in tears as his two oldest sons took the stand.\n\nboth boys emphatically tell the court, they are 100 percent certain they saw their mother alive that morning. logan said he even remembers asking his ailing mom if he could stay home from school to take care of her.\n\nthere are people who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, christine lovelace said. kids will share experiences as they know them, not what they're told to.\n\nand then came lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. she was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial.\n\nso how important is lyndsay's testimony? maher asked gough.\n\noh, it's critical. it's the whole ballgame, he replied.\n\nup until this trial, lyndsay had always insisted she saw her mother alive that morning. but now, at age 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.\n\nand i've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with dreasler.\n\nand yet, immediately afterwards, defense attorneys show a videotape made just two years earlier, where lyndsay tells det. adam gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning.\n\nin the end, if you can't, you can't remember, she said. ...and just say, 'i'm sorry. it was 10 years ago i can't remember.'\n\nwere you surprised by lyndsay's testimony when she got up and said, now i don't remember. i can't definitively say anything? maher asked det. gibson.\n\nyeah. you never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied.\n\nlyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.\n\nshe didn't remember, and that, to me, was very hard. because two years earlier, she had given a statement to adam gibson, that she remembered a lot, said jury foreperson adam buss.\n\nin the course of deliberations, i changed my mind, said juror mike hayden.\n\nyou answer one question. but it spawns another question, maher noted.\n\nright, another juror agreed.\n\njurors weigh the case\n\non feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. curtis lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. his new wife, christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on curtis' sons.\n\nwe know that everyday the focus is bringing their father and my husband home, she said. it's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. we're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.\n\nfor det. adam gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher.\n\ni want people to remember cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told maher. the jury will decide if somebody took that life from her.\n\nand you'll live with the decision, whatever it is? maher asked.\n\nwhatever it is, det. gibson replied.\n\nbut that decision may not be so easy.\n\nthe length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, i think i've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so i'm not sure. and if i'm not sure, i'm not sure a jury member is sure, gough pointed out.\n\nhow many of you thought it boiled down to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? maher asked the group of jurors. all six raised their hands.\n\ngoing back on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation room, as far as i'm concerned, juror adam buss said. i mean, we had jury members on the floor, you know, just - 'how do we lay? how you know, do we hold the covers?'\n\njury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. to try and figure it out, maher commented.\n\nright, said buss.\n\nand did that help? did the show-and-tell of it help you?\n\nit did. but it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.\n\nmeanwhile across town, lyndsay lovelace -- estranged from her father, stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the comfort of the home she shares with her grandmother.\n\nyeah, we need a verdict. we need some kind of closure -- some kind, said steve belko.\n\nand hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get back together again someday down in the future, said beth dobrzynski.\n\nif found guilty, curtis lovelace could spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\ni haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last year-and-a-half. every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing curtis home and proving his innocence, said christine lovelace.\n\nafter 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, lyndsay received that much anticipated call.\n\nbreaking news here inside the adams county courthouse. judge hardwick did just now declare a mistrial, jenny dreasler reported.curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.\n\nit was unreal and ... i felt so empty and out of breathe and the only thing i could do was hug my kids and let them know it is going to be ok and it is going to be ok, christine lovelace said of the jury's decision.\n\nthis is just dragging it out more. but if they're hung, they're hung. and there's nothing we can do about it. we just wait for the next round, lyndsay said of the outcome.\n\nit's set for retrial. and we plan to retry it, said prosecutor ed parkinson.\n\nif there's no new evidence, how do you paint it in a different light and not put yourself in a position of a hung jury again? maher asked.\n\nmaybe not paint in a different light. might paint it in the same light and with a different jury, he replied.\n\nbut this jury fought until the end.\n\ndid it ever become contentious? maher asked the six jurors.\n\nit did. i think, probably five of the jurors said, 'there is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' and two of those, i think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror mike hayden said. and that just deflated me so much.\n\njoyce ... you believe he did it? maher asked.\n\ni believe he did it, said stevens.\n\nhe's not guilty. and they didn't prove it to me, said tarr.\n\ni had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said stevens.\n\nwe're stuck, maher noted.\n\nit was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, stevens affirmed.\n\nsteve, do you think that curt killed cory? maher asked steve belko.\n\ni don't know. i don't wanna believe it. because everything i know about curt, he could not have done it. and -- i don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. i think of cory on that. because i know cory is -- is one tough cookie. she'd have fought to the death to defend her children.\n\ni don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'no way, no how, he didn't do it,' maher said to the lovelace's friends. there's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'my friend didn't do it.'\n\ni wouldn't go that far. i'm not entirely sure, said belko.\n\ni wouldn't go that far, either, said beth dobrzynski.\n\nit's definitely put a huge question in my mind. was there something-- some reason she died other than natural causes, said bret schrader.\n\nas the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue.\n\nthe question everyone has: what does the future hold for curtis lovelace?\n\nhow does he get his life back ... in his hometown? said gough.\n\nbecause in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said maher.\n\nyeah. yeah. and again when this ends ... i just don't see how he's gonna be given the benefit of the doubt, said gough.\n\nchristine lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name.\n\nthere's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. we will not allow him to sit in that jail cell for one day longer than he has to.\n\n...whatever it takes to make sure my husband is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes home. that's what matters, she continued.\n\nwith curtis' fate in limbo, lyndsay lovelace and her grandmother, marty didriksen, continue to try to move forward while keeping the focus on the cherished life they lost.\n\nyou don't want to lose sight of cory. she died too young. she left children. there's a family here. i mean, lindsey and her brothers. so try to put that back together if we can and move forward, she said.\n\ncory lovelace steve belko\n\ni just want everyone to find happiness again. and be able to remember the good times rather than the bad times, said lyndsay.\n\nshe was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. she had a beautiful personality, lyndsay said of her mother. she touched so many people and that's who she needs to be remembered as.\n\ncurtis lovelace's new trial date is scheduled for may 31.\n\nhis bail was set at $5 million. he remains in jail.
san juan, puerto rico — as puerto rico faces a wave of violent crime, law enforcement union leaders on the island are demanding that gov. ricardo rosselló fire public safety secretary héctor pesquera.\n\nif the governor does not take the decision that the people want, he will be completely responsible for the misfortunes, killings and bloodshed in our island, police union representative sgt. gregorio matías told cbs news.\n\nmatías and other puerto rican law enforcement union leaders traveled to the capitol in san juan on wednesday to call for pesquera's ouster. matías called pesquera an incompetent leader and accused him of demoralizing puerto rico's law enforcement agencies during an already trying time.\n\nthe puerto rico department of public safety oversees the island's police departments, firefighters, forensics institute, medical corps, and emergency and disaster management units, as well as the local investigations bureau. its secretary serves at the discretion of the governor.\n\na spokesperson for the governor's office didn't respond to cbs news' requests for comment, and pesquera canceled an interview with cbs news that was scheduled for wednesday.\n\nover the past weeks, mounting crime and gang violence — including murders captured on camera in broad daylight — have beset puerto rico, which is still recovering from the devastation of two powerful hurricanes and reeling from years of economic instability.\n\ndouglas leff, the top fbi official in puerto rico, told cbs news the island is facing a crisis of violence fueled by drug trafficking and gang turf wars.\n\none san juan resident said he has noticed a change when it comes to crime.\n\nthe pillos have no shame anymore, said josé pacheco, a car technician, referring to delinquents by a term used locally. they know there aren't many police officers around now. they no longer wait until it's dark to kill someone.\n\nsome residents have leveled heavy criticism against gov. rosselló's administration, saying it has not deployed enough police officers on the streets.\n\nmatías, who is still an active-duty officer, said the puerto rican police force has been decimated in the last couple of months as many officers have left to the mainland with their families to look for work with better pay and benefits.\n\nbecause no one listens to their concerns, officers are resigning. approximately 1,200 officers left the force last year and are now working in the (mainland) u.s., matías said. there is no future for a police officer in puerto rico. they have no medical or retirement benefits.\n\nthe island's resident commissioner and non-voting member of congress jenniffer gonzález asked the homeland security and justice departments on wednesday to increase their law enforcement capabilities and personnel in puerto rico to address a sense of impunity and lawfulness among the approximately 3.2 million u.s. citizens in the territory.\n\nsafety should be the first priority, gonzález told cbs news. i mean, if you can't feel safe in your house, if you can't feel safe to go to work, i mean that puts a heavy burden on the economy of the island. that puts a heavy burden on the quality of life of all puerto ricans.\n\ndavid begnaud contributed to this report.

firefighter marc hadden was working with the medical unit when he helped deliver the baby girl who would grow into the blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter he now knows as gracie.\n\nit was a surprisingly slow day for one of the busiest fire stations in myrtle beach, south carolina on november 11, 2011. hadden had spent the day training and killing time cleaning engines.\n\nwhen he finally sat down with his crew to eat dinner in the middle of his 24-hour shift, the phone rang — and he had to hop into an ambulance to make an emergency call. when he arrived on scene, he and his partner found a pregnant woman in labor. as soon as they helped her into the ambulance, she was ready to give birth.\n\ngrace hadden poses with her two big brothers. marc hadden\n\nit was the first time hadden took charge during a delivery in his two decades of working.\n\ni was tasked with everything to do with gracie, hadden told cbs news. i helped her take her first breath.\n\nthe team then called for backup and rushed to the hospital to drop off the mother and child. while filling out routine paperwork at the hospital, hadden overheard nurses say the new mom requested the baby girl be put up for adoption immediately.\n\nthrow my name in the hat if this baby's being put up for adoption, hadden said jokingly.\n\nbut he wasn't actually kidding.\n\ndue to medical complications, hadden and his wife, rebecca, weren't able to have any more children after they had their second son.\n\nwe checked into adopting, but it was way too expensive, hadden. we prayed about it.\n\nmarc hadden poses with his newborn daughter, gracie, shortly after her adoption.\n\nthe nurses turned to hadden and said, you need to go talk to this mom.\n\nhesitantly, hadden walked into the woman's hospital room to introduce himself. he explained that he has two kids, his wife's a school teacher and they want to have more children, but aren't able to. after a friendly chat, hadden swung by the nursery and sent his wife a picture of the smiley little girl.\n\nshe jokingly texted back, can we keep her?\n\nfirefighter marc hadden shares a photo of his adopted daughter, gracie, when she was a baby. marc hadden\n\nhadden knew his wife wasn't joking either.\n\nexhausted, hadden headed home to talk to his wife in person. they both agreed, it was worth trying. what did they have to lose?\n\nthe next day, rebecca visited the woman in the hospital.\n\nwith both of our boys, we had families, support and a ton of stuff, hadden said. this mom didn't. she had nothing. no family that was there.\n\nas rebecca started to walk out of the hospital, a doctor stopped her in the hallway and said, she's ready to go forward with the adoption.\n\nthe hadden family. marc hadden\n\nforty-eight hours later, the haddens had their little girl, and in march 2012 the closed adoption that the girl's birth mom requested was complete.\n\nit was meant to be, hadden said. everything that happened that day changed: my station, assignment, the location. so many things happened that made us 100 percent sure.\n\nour bond is extremely tight, says marc hadden of his 5-year-old daughter, gracie. marc hadden\n\nthe family named their baby girl rebecca grace hadden; she goes by gracie.\n\nthe name grace over the years has become extremely fitting for her, hadden said of the now 5-year-old. she's an awesome kid.\n\nthe 5-year-old girl loves playing with her brothers and dressing up with her mom, but she especially loves hearing the story of how her daddy delivered her in the back of an ambulance.\n\nour bond is extremely tight. she's a part of the family, and we love her more than life, hadden said. we wouldn't change anything. we would do it all again if we could.
if you're looking for clues to the next big thing in social media, keep an eye on the realm of dark social.\n\nwhat's that, you may ask? the term first emerged in 2012, coined by the atlantic writer alexis c. madrigal. it refers to social content that is shared through private channels, rather than more public forums like facebook where posts can be seen and shared openly by a wide circle of people. think e-mail communications or chats on messaging apps like kik or snapchat. as a result of being shared through private channels, this content often exists beyond the reach of standard analytic tools and metrics that companies use to assess how content is shared and where it is being shared from.\n\nthe term dark social certainly gives people pause when they first hear it. it sounds a lot like the dark web, conjuring headlines of hackers, cyberterrorism, and illicit online content. but greg swan, vp of public relations and emerging media at the digital advertising agency space150, said that rather than something sinister, it simply refers to personal communication that is happening below the radar.\n\nto best explain it, swan used the example of a grandmother copying and pasting a link and sending it to her grandson. it's a popular news story that's been trending, but the original site that housed the content has no idea that the traffic generated from that simple share stemmed from grandma's original email. her grandson can tweet out the story, which gets re-tweeted by 10,000 people who then click on it. it starts a domino effect with an untraceable chain, which carries with it implications for how brands and organizations need to better assess their analytics and how they're reaching users.\n\nat the south by southwest (sxsw) interactive festival, swan and his colleague marc jensen gave a talk entitled deep web and dark social: is anything really private, exploring the state of how we communicate today, what it means for personal privacy, and how shifts in messaging technology are shaping the media we consume and the brands and businesses we follow.\n\npeople want to connect with each other, and people will give up certain private information in exchange for value in how they communicate, swan told cbs news. if you believe that, then it is easier to understand when the next thing comes out whether it will have longevity or not.\n\nin social media, trends change rapidly. last week's snapchat could be this week's yik yak. what is consistent is the shift toward personal, private communications through larger social channels. for instance, members of generation z -- the group younger than millennials, born in 1996 or later -- have gravitated away from the very public forums presented by social networks like facebook and twitter and toward messaging apps that are immediate, visual, impermanent, and most crucially private. it is a more intimate take on the kind of social media interaction that exploded in popularity over the past decade.\n\nwith a rise in this messaging culture, dark social becomes increasingly significant.\n\nit literally gives them exactly what they want. all of these apps are driving communication that is really instant, jensen, the chief technology officer for space150, told cbs news. i mean snapchat, the interface is really hard for a lot of people to understand, but even with that, you turn it on and the camera is is running right away. it's there immediately for people.\n\njensen asserted that this kind of quick, immediate, yet private communication emphasizes the visual over the textual. he said that we are moving increasingly toward chats that skip text completely. if you're having a bad day, sending a selfie with a sad facial expression communicates the idea in a snap.\n\nwith this kind of messaging, a picture is literally worth a thousand words, jensen said.\n\namong users who are flocking to this kind of mobile communication, how big a concern is privacy and security?\n\nswan said that basing an opinion solely on the sxsw crowd might be skewed given the fact that he and jensen addressed an audience of pretty well-educated people well-versed in the intersection of privacy and technology. that being said, he stressed that there is a legitimate education gap between the latest technologies and their privacy policies and people taking responsibility for their own security.\n\nultimately, it is up to you to control your privacy, assuming that you have the tools to control your privacy, swan said.\n\njensen agreed, adding that it is key that users understand exactly how they can create safeguards to protect their data. he added that an emerging arena for privacy debates could revolve around the rise of voice-recognition devices and internet of things-connected smart home devices that don't necessarily have screens and keyboards.\n\nwhen you have a device that is essentially always listening, it will be interesting to see how companies tackle that idea of a user being recorded at all times. some companies are very transparent about this, jensen said.\n\nat the end of the day, it falls on the individual to protect him or herself, jensen added.\n\nconcerns over people hacking your laptop web camera or looking into your records is not a reason to fear all web cams or be angry at apple, he said. it's up to you to do the

hope solo made a name for herself as one of the most accomplished soccer goalkeepers in the world. she helped the u.s. women's team win the 2015 world cup, played on three consecutive olympic teams and set records for the longest undefeated streak by a goalkeeper.\n\nbut she's also made headlines for what happened off the field. in her years on the u.s. national team, solo spoke out about coaching decisions, was suspended for 30 days, and encouraged teammates to join her in a federal complaint alleging wage discrimination.\n\nher time with the team came to an explosive end in 2016 when the united states soccer federation terminated her contract for negative comments she made about an opposing team at the rio olympics. now, solo has launched a bid to lead the same organization that axed her.\n\nsolo joined cbs this morning to discuss what kind of change she'd like to bring to the organization as president.\n\nfor 20 years during my career i fought for change within the system. i fought for gender equity, i fought against injustices, and we weren't really getting anywhere. so this became kind of a natural step for me to really, really continue that fight, to run for president and to really get inside the organization and force this change that we've been fighting for 20 years to do, solo said.\n\nshe said her platform would focus most importantly on developing youth.\n\nu.s. soccer has $150 million in surplus funds and they don't put it back to the youth in america, and so it's really become this sport here in america that's dedicated to the rich white kid and we are excluding so many potential great youth players, solo said. u.s. soccer's mission statement is to make soccer the preeminent sport here in the united states. we can't do that unless we make it accessible and affordable for every young kid in america.\n\naccording to solo, the costs for young kids participating in sports continue to grow.\n\nit costs anywhere between $5,000 to $11,000 per year for a young kid in travel expenses, just for registration fees. and most kids can't afford it anymore, she said.\n\neven with her controversial history, solo said she does have support within the federation.\n\nit's not just the board members at u.s. soccer. it's not just, you know, the current leadership within the federation. soccer is important to a lot of people and a lot of people have voting rights to this election, she said.\n\ngiven her past, some say she may be a great athlete but that she's not the best role model.\n\ni've been through things off the field but it's only made me a better leader and a better person. i'm done apologizing for them. i've learned from them and i think it's important that we all do the same, she said.\n\ndespite a federal complaint about wage discrimination, solo said the women's soccer team has still not achieved equal pay.\n\nunfortunately, the federation tries to convolute it to the general public by saying, well, it's equitable. but what's equitable mean? that's the same thing as equal. really, we're still not there yet. that's another part of my platform, gender equality, she said.
new york - u.s. stocks traded higher tuesday as industrial and internet companies rose, and the major stock indexes notched their first three-day winning streak since november.\n\neven though the latest round of trade talks between the u.s. and china ended without word of progress, investors were heartened that there were no evident signs of setbacks either.\n\ntalks with china are going very well! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 8, 2019\n\nthe s&p 500 index rose 25 points, or 1 percent, to close at 2,574. the dow jones industrials picked up 256 points, or 1.1 percent, ending at 23,787. early in tuesday's trading, the dow jumped as much as 333 points.\n\nthe nasdaq composite gained 74 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 6,897. the russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 19 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 1,425.\n\nrailroad operator union pacific jumped 8.8 percent to close at $150.75 after it named an industry veteran to a top executive position. autonation fell 3.9 to $36.18 after predicting a weak year for auto sales.\n\nthere was no evidence tuesday that the u.s. and china made significant progress in their latest round of trade talks, and experts say it will take months for them to resolve the causes of the trade war, which include disagreements over beijing's handling of technology and intellectual property.\n\nbut investors have become notably more optimistic about an eventual deal, a sharp reversal of the concerns that helped send stocks plunging in october and december. an agreement between the two biggest economic powers in the world could remove a major obstacle to global economic growth.\n\nkate warne, an investment strategist for edward jones, said the market's large moves reflect investors' questions about major issues including economic growth, the threats of recession and trade tensions, and rising interest rates. she said it's normal for stocks to change course as traders grapple with those issues on a day-to-day basis.\n\nyou have new information that's driving stock prices both higher and lower, and that's pretty typical when there's uncertainty and there's a lot of new information coming into the market, she said.\n\nwarne added that trading on wall street is typically light during the holidays, and that can exaggerate market moves up or down.\n\nwells fargo investment institute expects the u.s.-china trade talks will continue to be a focus for investors. since formal talks have only just begun, we expect this trade-related narrative to remain with the markets for some time, the firm said in a report. that said, we expect risks related to tariff escalation to remain contained so long as talks remain productive and progressive.\n\noil prices also continued to rally. u.s. crude was on track to rise for the eighth day in the last nine and jumped 2.3 percent to $49.71 per barrel in new york. brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 1.7 percent to $58.33 a barrel in london.\n\nu.s. crude dropped from $76 a barrel in early october to about $42 a barrel on dec. 24 as investors worried about slowing economic growth and a supply glut. the modest recovery in oil prices has helped energy company stocks after they took big losses at the end of 2018.\n\nsouth korean smartphone and computer chip maker samsung said demand for chips is weak because the global economy is slowing. the company expects its fourth-quarter sales to drop 11 percent compared to a year ago and said its operating profit will fall as well. samsung also said its phones are facing stiffer competition, and its stock fell 1.7 percent in seoul.\n\nu.s. chipmakers, nvidia and applied materials also fell.\n\ntech stocks were roiled on thursday after apple said iphone sales in china were falling.\n\nbond prices fell and yields rose, a sign investors expect continued economic growth and higher interest rates. the yield on the 10-year treasury note rose to 2.71 percent from 2.65 percent late monday.\n\nhigher interest rates allow banks to make bigger profits on lending, but despite the increase tuesday, banks stocks declined. investors may have been preparing for future disappointment: analysts for goldman sachs lowered their forecasts for bond yields around the world because of weakening economic growth and tightening financial conditions. the yield on the 10-year treasury note has fallen sharply since october, when it reached a seven-year high, and the report said yields may have peaked for this [economic] cycle.
an artwork called mcjesus, which was sculpted by finnish artist jani leinonen and depicts a crucified ronald mcdonald, is seen on display as part of the haifa museum's sacred goods exhibit, in haifa, israel, jan. 14, 2019. ap\n\nhaifa, israel -- an art exhibit in israel featuring a crucified ronald mcdonald has sparked protests by the country's arab christian minority.\n\nhundreds of christians calling for the removal of the sculpture, entitled mcjesus, demonstrated at the museum in the northern city of haifa last week. israeli police say rioters hurled a firebomb at the museum and threw stones that wounded three police officers. authorities dispersed the crowds with tear gas and stun grenades.\n\nchurch representatives brought their grievances to the district court monday, demanding it order the removal of the exhibit's most offensive items, including barbie doll renditions of a bloodied jesus and the virgin mary.\n\nmuseum director nissim tal said that he was shocked at the sudden uproar, especially because the exhibit - intended to criticize what many view as society's cult-like worship of capitalism - had been on display for months. it has also been shown in other countries without incident.\n\nthe protests appear to have been sparked by visitors sharing photos of the exhibit on social media.\n\nchristians make up a tiny percentage of israel's arab minority and say they face unique challenges.\n\nwe need to understand that freedom of expression is interpreted in different ways in different societies, said wadie abu nassar, an adviser to church leaders. if this work was directed against non-christians, the world would be turned upside down.\n\nisraeli culture minister miri regev, who has been accused of censorship for pushing legislation mandating national loyalty in art, also called for the removal of the disrespectful artwork.\n\nthe museum has refused to remove the artwork, saying that doing so would infringe on freedom of expression. but following the protests it hung a curtain over the entrance to the exhibit and posted a sign saying the art was not intended to offend.\n\nthis is the maximum that we can do, tal said. if we take the art down, the next day we'll have politicians demanding we take other things down and we'll end up only with colorful pictures of flowers in the museum.\n\nbut that did little to placate those who want the artwork removed. a protester remained camped out in a tent at the museum on monday with a sign reading respect religions. police watched closely as local christians complained to reporters in front of street signs spray-painted with crosses and windows still shattered from last week's clashes.\n\nthis is very offensive and i cannot consider this art, haifa artist and devout christian amir ballan said. we will continue through peaceful rallies and candle vigils... we won't be quiet until we reach a solution.\n\njani leinonen, the finnish artist behind mcjesus, has also asked that it be taken down - but for a different reason.\n\nhe says he supports boycott, divestment, sanctions, or bds, a palestinian-led movement aimed at pressuring israel to change its policies toward the palestinians. the group has made significant gains in recent years, persuading a number of foreign artists to cancel performances in israel.\n\ntal said the museum won't bow to religious or political pressure.\n\nwe will be defending freedom of speech, freedom of art, and freedom of culture, and will not take it down, he said.
with only a few days left in president trump's term, congressional democrats are calling on vice president mike pence to invoke the 25th amendment to remove mr. trump from office. now, mary trump, the president's niece, says that mr. trump must be held accountable for wednesday's capitol assault and barred from ever running for public office again.\n\nin an interview on cbsn's red & blue, trump told host elaine quijano that the riot on capitol hill was a direct result of [the president's] unwillingness to concede the election. his insistence that it was stolen or rigged.\n\nand it was also the direct result of the abject cowardice shown by his own party, and its failure to stand up to his egregious lies around this election, she said.\n\ntrump said that, while she was not surprised by the violent events of january 6, she was still horrified.\n\ntrump, a psychologist who authored the book too much and never enough: how my family created the most dangerous man in the world, explains that mr. trump's response to his electoral defeat comes from the stigma their family placed on losing.\n\nlosing was literally the worst thing you can do, she said. so, for the first time in his life, donald finds himself in a situation in which, not just that he's lost, but he cannot for the life of him figure out a way to turn the loss into a win — something he's always been able to do in the past because he's perfectly happy to lie, cheat and steal his way to a win.\n\ntrump says this is making her uncle increasingly desperate and dangerous, in my view.\n\ntrump also criticized the republican party for not doing enough to hold the president accountable. she said that their refusal to take action after the violent insurrection has left mr. trump feeling enabled to do whatever he feels he needs to do in order to stay in the oval office.\n\nthe president and vice president met for the first time on monday since the riots, but mr. trump never contacted pence during the siege of the capitol to check on his safety. trump said this did not surprise her.\n\nit doesn't matter that mike pence was fulfilling his constitutional duty, she explained. it matters, in donald's mind, that mike pence betrayed him. it shouldn't surprise mike pence, either. he's seen what happens to people who don't toe the line 100% of the time.\n\ntrump said she was not surprised to learn mr. trump would not be attending president-elect joe biden's inauguration, either. she said attending would mean ceding the spotlight to mr. biden, and it would also amount to a concession.\n\none thing we need to remember, despite all these videos ... he has not yet conceded the election, trump said. so he's still clinging to the idea that he can change that result somehow.\n\nshe concluded by saying that mr. trump must be barred from ever running for public office again.\n\nbecause if he is allowed to, then as soon as joe biden is sworn in, donald is going to start his 2024 campaign, trump said. i don't believe he intends to run, but he's going to pretend to run and he will continue to have way too big a platform from which to continue to incite his supporters.
for our series three meals, major garrett traveled to three cities in texas to talk to voters over breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nin texas, impeachment came up frequently; overall, most voters were fatigued by it all. but those paying close attention defied party stereotypes.\n\nat the avalon diner in stafford, texas, jeannine benoit said she supported president trump; her husband, scott, did not vote for mr. trump in 2016, but will this year. cbs news\n\nbreakfast: stafford, texas\n\ngarrett started in a diverse area outside of houston with eggs, hash browns and pancakes at the avalon diner in stafford.\n\nthe economy is going really well, said dentist scott benoit. i think overall we're safe as a country. everything's going pretty well.\n\nthe now hiring sign outside backs that up; the avalon's owner told us she's lost workers to better jobs elsewhere.\n\nbenoit did not vote for mr. trump in 2016, but will this year. his wife jeannine, a speech therapist, was with the president from the beginning. i just have more conservative values, so i tend to go more with that person, she said.\n\njust across from scott and jeannine, garrett met bernard and sharon maynore. both work in health care. bernard said, i feel mystified when i'm listening to what donald trump has to say.\n\ngarrett asked, how frequently now, or during the trump presidency, have you found yourself shaking your head?\n\nevery day, sharon replied.  my co-workers said that we needed a change, they wanted to make america great again. i'm wondering, do those same people, do they think that he has made american great again?\n\nat mac's bar-b-q in midland, alison loera and laura ortega discussed president trump's divisive rhetoric. cbs news\n\nlunch: midland, texas\n\nthen it was on to lunch in conservative midland, a boom town in west texas, where oil and natural gas production runs around the clock.\n\nat mac's bar-b-q, a local favorite, the brisket is slow-cooked out back for 18 hours. customers start arriving for lunch around 11.\n\nkyle davis, his brother jake, and their business partner tom hull run a construction and drilling company. kyle and jake support president trump and expect him to be re-elected.\n\ni don't like all the nonsense that comes with him, kyle said. but yeah, his policy has been spot-on.\n\njake added, i really don't want another obama. i kind of feel like he divided our country.\n\ngarrett asked both about impeachment. kyle's answer surprised him: was it an impeachable offense? yeah, it sounds like it probably was, he said.\n\njake took the long view: i'm sure at some point every president could have been impeached.\n\ntom hull calls himself a new england republican and considers mr. trump a failure. the economy's been propped up with record levels of deficit spending, he said. and he picks fights that he doesn't know how to get out of.\n\ngarrett also met alison loera, laura ortega and jennifer reyes. loera works in insurance; ortega and reyes are data specialists for drilling companies.\n\nthey criticized the president for his comments about the hispanic community. loera said, we feel targeted.\n\ngarrett asked, do you feel lumped in or somehow demonized?\n\nin a way, i guess, loera replied.\n\nreyes said, comments like that shouldn't be made by someone with that much power and authority.\n\nblake hammerton and daniel torres discuss the 2020 campaign with cbs news chief washington correspondent major garrett, at the flying saucer pub in garland, texas. cbs news\n\ndinner: garland, texas\n\ndinner took garrett to the flying saucer pub in garland, a politically-moderate area northeast of dallas.\n\ni voted for trump, said rita dusek. i did, because i thought we need somebody who's not a politician. but that didn't seem to work out, she laughed.\n\ngarrett asked, will you vote for him again?\n\nno, she said.\n\nher husband, al, a registered republican, said, i did not vote for him. i don't like extremism on either side.\n\njust across the way garrett met david lindsay, who owns a construction firm. the economy has probably been the best since i've owned the company, he said.\n\ndo you give anyone in the political world credit for that? asked garrett.\n\ni will solidly give the president credit for doing it, said lindsey.\n\nthe president's volatile style was raised: do you ever wish he would tone it down? asked garrett.\n\noh, yeah, i think somebody should hide his cellphone on him, lindsey said.\n\nblake hammerton and daniel torres both opposed mr. trump in 2016, and will vote in the march 3 texas democratic primary.\n\ni have very, very strong feeling: the young vote will come out this year, torres said.\n\ngarrett asked, when you think about the democrats, what are your thoughts?\n\nstop making everything a battle to the end, hammerton said. the democrats are exhausting themselves and exhausting the public.\n\nsounds like they're exhausting you? yes! he said.\n\ngarrett said of his excursion that, among democrats, he did not find hard-core supporters of elizabeth warren, bernie sanders or joe biden. flat line across the board, texas democrats are waiting for iowa, new hampshire, south carolina and nevada to sort this out, he said. democrats said they were keeping an open mind for texas' 'super tuesday' primary.\n\none person they were keeping in mind, because he's on tv so frequently in texas, is mike bloomberg, he added, noting the billionaire's strategy of creating an impression with voters via paid ads while his opponents — fighting it out in iowa, new hampshire and elsewhere — have yet to make an impression in the lone star state.\n\ngarrett asked everyone if they had seen or remembered a bloomberg tv ad. all but two had. trump supporters said they thought bloomberg might give the president the toughest challenge.\n\none other thing: when we asked people what they thought about the november election, they said two words: anticipation, and dread.\n\nother entries in our three meals series:
you know that universal sign we give truckers, hoping they'll sound their air horns? well, you're going to be hearing a lot less honking in the future. and with good reason. the absence of an actual driver in the cab. we may focus on the self-driving car, but autonomous trucking is not an if, it's a when. and the when is coming sooner than you might expect. already, companies have been quietly testing their prototypes on public roads. right now, there's a high-stakes, high-speed race pitting the usual suspects, google and tesla and other global tech firms, against small start-ups smelling opportunity. the driverless semi will convulse the trucking sector and the two million american drivers who turn a key and maneuver their big rig every day. and the winners of this derby, they may be poised to make untold billions, they'll change the u.s. transportation grid and they will emerge as the new kings of the road.\n\ncbs news\n\n\n\nit's one of the great touchstones of americana: the romance and possibility of the open road. all hail the 18-wheeler hugging those asphalt ribbons, transporting all of our stuff across the fruited plains, from sea to shining sea. though we may not give it a second thought when we click that free shipping icon, truckers move 70% of the nation's goods. but trucking cut a considerably different figure on a humid sunday last summer on the florida turnpike. starsky robotics, a tech startup, may have been driving in the right lane, but they passed the competition with 35,000 pounds of steel thundering down a busy highway with nobody behind the wheel. the test was a milestone. starsky was the first company to put a truck on an open highway without a human on board. everyone else in the game with the know-how keeps a warm body in the cab as backup. for now, anyway. if you didn't hear about this, you're not alone; in jacksonville, we talked to jeff widdows, his son tanner, linda allen and eric richardson - all truckers; and all astonished to learn how far this technology has come.\n\nlinda allen: i wasn't aware 'til i ran across one on the florida turnpike and that just-- it just scares me. i can't imagine. but i didn't know anything about it.\n\njon wertheim: no one's talkin' about it at work.\n\njeff widdows: nobody, never, never.\n\neric richardson: i didn't know that it'd come so far. and i'm thinking, wow. it's here.\n\ntruckers speak with correspondent jon wertheim cbs news\n\nhe's right. the autonomous truck revolution is here. it just isn't much discussed - not on cb radios; and not in statehouses. and transportation agencies are not inclined to pump the brakes. from florida, hang a left and drive 2000 miles west on i-10 and you'll hit the proving grounds of a company with a fleet of 41 autonomous rigs.\n\njon wertheim: this is a shop floor? or this is a laboratory\n\nchuck price: it's both.\n\nin the guts of the sonoran desert, outside tucson, chuck price is chief product officer at tusimple, a privately held, global autonomous trucking outfit valued at more than a billion dollars with operations in the u.s. and china. at this depot, $12 million worth of gleaming self-driving semis are on the move.\n\njon wertheim: right now we've got safety operators in the cab. how far away are we from runs without drivers?\n\nchuck price: we believe we'll be able to do our first driver-out demonstration runs on public highways in 2021.\n\nthat's the when. as for the how...\n\nchuck price: our primary sensor system is our array of cameras that you see along the top of the vehicle--\n\njon wertheim: heard about souping up vehicles. this takes it to a new level.\n\nchuck price: it's a little bit different… yeah.\n\nthe competition is fierce, so much so their technology is akin to a state secret. but price points us to a network of sensors, cameras and radar devices strapped to the outside of the rig, all of it hardwired to an internal ai supercomputer that drives the truck. it's self-contained — so a bad wifi signal won't wreak havoc on the road.\n\nchuck price: our system can see farther than any other autonomous system in the world. we can see forward over a half mile.\n\njon wertheim: you can drive autonomously at night?\n\n\n\nchuck price: we can. day, night. and in the rain. and in the rain at night.\n\nchuck price shows correspondent jon wertheim the automated trucks. cbs news\n\nand they're working on driving in the snow. chuck price has unshakable confidence in the reliability of the technology; as do some of the biggest names in shipping: ups, amazon and the u.s. postal service ship freight with tusimple trucks. all in, each unit costs more than a quarter million dollars. not a great expense, considering it's designed to eliminate the annual salary of a driver; currently around $45,000. another savings: the driverless truck can get coast-to-coast in two days, not four, stopping only to refuel—though a human still has to do that.\n\nwe wanted to hop in and experience automated trucking firsthand.\n\njon wertheim: i feel like it's our turn on space mountain.\n\n\n\nchuck price was happy to oblige. we didn't know what to expect, so we fashioned more cameras to the rig than nasa glued to the apollo rockets...\n\nmaureen fitzgerald: is everybody buckled in?\n\nall: buckled in.\n\nmaureen fitzgerald: three, two, one….\n\n...and we hit go.\n\n\n\ntruck computer: autonomous driving started.\n\nwe sat in the back alongside the computer. in the front seat: maureen fitzgerald, a trucker's trucker with 30 years experience. she was our safety driver, babysitting with no intention of gripping the wheel, but there just in case. riding shotgun: an engineer, john panttila, there to monitor the software. the driverless truck was attempting a 65-mile loop in weekday traffic through tucson.\n\nmaureen fitzgerald's foot while automated technology takes the wheel. cbs news\n\nthe route was mapped and programmed in before the run, but that's about it - the rest was up to the computer, which makes 20 decisions per second about what to do on the road. as we rolled past distracted drivers, disabled cars, slow-pokes and sheriffs, our safety driver kept vigil but never disengaged the driverless system.\n\njohn panttila: watching the front targets close in a hundred. yep. got to cut in right now. 55 mile an hour. bad cut-off.\n\njon wertheim: this guy just flagrantly cut off--\n\nchuck price: he just really cut us off.\n\njon wertheim: we did not honk at him. did we disengage?\n\nchuck price: we did not disengage. this vehicle will detect that kind of behavior faster than the humans.\n\njon wertheim: how far are we from being able to pick up the specific cars that are passing us? oh, that's joe from new jersey with six points on his license.\n\n\n\nchuck price: we can read license plates. so if there was an accessible database for something like that, we could.\n\nchuck price says that would be valuable to the company though he admits it could create obvious privacy issues. but tusimple does collect a lot of data, as it maps more and more routes across the southwest. their enterprise also includes a fleet of autonomous trucks in shanghai, as well as a research center in beijing. the data collected by every truck, along every mile, it's uploaded and used by tusimple, they say only to perfect performance on the road. maureen fitzgerald is convinced that tusimple's technology is superior to human drivers.\n\njon wertheim: you call these trucks your babies? what do your babies do well, and what could they do better?\n\nmaureen fitzgerald: this truck is scanning mirrors, looking 1,000 meters out. it's processing all the things that my brain could never do and it can react 15 times faster than i could.\n\nmost of her two million fellow truckers are less enthusiastic. automated trucking threatens to jack-knife an entire $800 billion industry. trucking is among the most common jobs for american's without a college education. so this disruption caused by the driverless truck, it cuts deep.\n\nsteve viscelli: as truckers like to say, if you bought it, a truck brought it.\n\nsteve viscelli is a sociologist at the university of pennsylvania and an expert in freight transportation and automation. he also spent six months driving a big rig.\n\njon wertheim: what segment do you think's gonna be hit first by driverless trucks?\n\n\n\nsteve viscelli: i've identified two segments that i think are most at-risk. and that's-- refrigerated and dry van truckload. and those constitute about 200,000 trucking jobs. and then what's called line haul and they're somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000-90,000 jobs there.\n\n\n\njon wertheim: so you're talkin' 300,000 jobs off the top-- it's a big number.\n\n\n\nsteve viscelli: it is a big number.\n\ncbs news\n\nthe florida truckers we met represent 70 years experience and millions of safe driving miles. they say they love the job and when asked to describe their work they kick around words like vital, honest and patriotic.\n\neric richardson: it makes you feel like you could-- should just poke your chest out with the responsibility (laugh) that you're taking on kinda makes you feel like a-- like you're needed.\n\nasked about driverless trucks, they feel like they are being run off the road. but another issue troubles them even more.\n\njeff widdows: i think that companies need to keep safety in mind… you have a glitch in a computer at that speed--\n\nlinda allen: yeah.\n\njeff widdows: (laugh) you can do some damage--\n\nlinda allen: there's too many things that can go wrong.\n\neric richardson: one of them semis hits something that's small, like a car or a passenger car, or anything like that, it's a done deal. i mean...\n\nlinda allen: i was on 75-- last month-- through ocala. and there was a bad accident so a state trooper came out. and he was hand-signaling people. you go here. you go there. how's an autonomous truck gonna recognize what the officer is trying to say or do? how's that gonna work?\n\njon wertheim: sympathy, empathy, fear, code, eye contact-- i don't know how you create an algorithm that accounts for all that.\n\nlinda allen: you can't.\n\njon wertheim: does the public have a right to know if they're testing driverless trucks on the interstate--\n\nall: --absolutely--\n\ntanner widdows: that's-- well, that's our concern, is -- who's watching this? who's making sure they're not throwing something unsafe on the road?\n\nsam loesche: i think a lot of it-- is being done with almost no oversight from-- good governance groups, from the government itself\n\nsam loesche represents 600,000 truckers for the teamsters. he's concerned that federal, state and local governments have only limited access to the driverless technology.\n\nsam loesche: a lot of this information, understandably, is proprietary. tech companies wanna keep, you know, their algorithms and their safety data-- secret until they can kinda get it right. the problem is that, in the meantime, they're testing this technology on public roads. they're testing it next to you as you drive down the road.\n\nand that was consistent with our reporting.\n\njon wertheim: do you have to tell anyone when you test?\n\nchuck price: no, not for individual tests.\n\njon wertheim: do you have to tell them where you test?\n\nchuck price: we do not currently have to tell them where we test in arizona.\n\njon wertheim: or how-- how often you test?\n\nchuck price: no.\n\njon wertheim: do you have to share your data with any state department of transportation?\n\nchuck price: currently, we're not required to share data, we would be happy to share data.\n\njon wertheim: what about inspections? does anyone from the arizona dot come by and-- and check this stuff out?\n\nchuck price: the dot comes by all the time. we talk with them regularly. it's not a formal inspection process yet.\n\na self-driving truck on the road. cbs news\n\nwe wanted to ask elaine chao, secretary of the department of transportation, about regulating this emerging sector. she declined an interview, but provided us with a statement which reads in part: the department needs to prepare for the transportation systems of the future by engaging with new technologies to address… safety… without hampering innovation.\n\nto that point, chuck price is emphatic that driverless trucks pose fewer dangers.\n\nchuck price: we eliminate texting accidents, no distraction--\n\njon wertheim: because there's no-- no texting while driving when there's a computer.\n\nchuck price: there are no drunk computers. and the computer doesn't sleep. so those are large causes of accidents.\n\nhe adds that driverless trucks are more fuel efficient in part because they can stay perfectly aligned in their lane and unlike humans, are programmed never to speed, but he admits the profit motive is significant.\n\njon wertheim: you think there's a lot of money to be made here.\n\nchuck price: there's certainly a lot of money to be made. there's a-- there's an opportunity to solve a very big problem.\n\nsteve viscelli says the industry may be imperfect, but he thinks the solution should not depend on driverless technology alone.\n\njon wertheim: what's your response to the technology companies that say, look, i'm trying to do something more efficiently, and i'm going to improve safety. this is american enterprise. what are you gonna get in the way of this for?\n\nsteve viscelli: i'd say that-- that's wonderful. (laugh) but that's not your job. right? your job's to make money. policy is gonna decide what our outcomes are gonna be trucking is a very competitive industry. the low-road approach often wins\n\njon wertheim: we talk about the internal combustion engine replacing the horse and buggy, and eisenhower's interstate system-- when we talk about these transformational markers in transportation-- where's driverless trucking gonna rank?\n\nsteve viscelli: it's gonna be one of the biggest.\n\nproduced by michael karzis. associate producer, megan kelty. broadcast associates, annabelle hanflig and cristina gallotto. edited by april wilson.
six months after wdbj-tv correspondent alison parker and cameraman adam ward were gunned down on live television, parker's parents say they're on a mission to change gun laws, in an interview to be broadcast on cbs' sunday morning on march 13.\n\nalison parker and adam ward cbs news\n\nthe interview is part of a special edition of sunday morning, titled guns and america, which looks at the role of firearms in the country from a variety of historical, cultural, political and personal points of view.\n\nparker and ward were killed by a former coworker as they were reporting live on the morning news in roanoke, va., last august. the man who shot them had passed a background check and legally bought the gun he used to kill the two reporters and seriously wound another person, before taking his own life.\n\nnonetheless, parker's parents, barbara and andy, have turned their grief into motivation to require tougher background checks for gun purchases, and to close loopholes in gun purchase requirements, in spite of strong lobbying by gun rights proponents (such as the nra) against such laws.\n\nwe're on a mission. i don't think it's quixotic, andy parker told correspondent erin moriarty. and i don't think we're going to fail.\n\nwe've seen this become a national conversation, added barbara parker. whereas, even a couple of years ago, no one would talk about it. but now people are all discussing it, and telling us, 'what you're doing is important.'\n\nmoriarty talks with the parkers about their lives after their daughter and ward were killed. moriarty also talks with chris hurst, parker's boyfriend and an anchor at wdbj-tv, a cbs affiliate.\n\nhurst hadn't tuned in the morning news that day because, he explains, parker claimed she'd mess up if she knew he was watching. hurst added that he lost everything that day.\n\nnow, he watches the parkers honor their daughter's spirit by fighting for change. that fight, however, comes with risks, as they have become targets, he tells moriarty: but, we don't have any fear. we really feel like [alison]'s guiding us, and we're just following her lead.\n\nclick here for more with hurst.\n\nthe emmy award-winning sunday morning with charles osgood, is broadcast on cbs on sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. et. executive producer is rand morrison.\n\nfollow the program on twitter (@cbssunday), facebook, instagram (#cbssundaymorning) and at cbssundaymorning.com. you can also listen to sunday morning audio podcasts at play.it.
a digital pioneer and philanthropist is trying to break the myths surrounding the road to success and changing the world. jean case, a former senior executive in the early days of aol and now the ceo of the case foundation, is out with a new book called be fearless: 5 principles for a life of breakthroughs and purpose.\n\neveryone around the world, we found, has ideas about what they might do to change the world, but often they're stopped by the idea that maybe you need a special genius or wealth or certain connections or graduating from the right school, case said friday on cbs this morning. our research really uncovered that actually none of that is the case. and what i do in the book is i take readers behind the scene of famous success stories and not so famous success stories to point out that there's failures and fears along the way.\n\namong the stories she shares is one of spanx founder and ceo sara blakely, who was wearing capri pants with sandals and wanted something with a slimming effect of pantyhose. she went on to create spanx and now has an estimated net worth of $1 billion, according to forbes.\n\nshe had no background in fashion. she didn't have an mba. she was selling fax machines at the time. but she took her idea forward sort of point by point. she went to neiman marcus and went in the dressing room and tried them on for someone and they made a big order, and then oprah chose her as one of her favorite things, case said.\n\namong the other fearless leaders case profiles are chef josé andrés, airbnb co-founders brian chesky and joe gebbia, and equal justice initiative executive director bryan stevenson.\n\ncase also tells of her own story, jumping from a comfortable job at ge to a startup.\n\npeople thought i was crazy to leave what was really a good career trajectory at ge to take this big risk on a start-up. but actually i believed in my heart that i could achieve more of the goals i'd set out for myself and make a bigger difference in the world if i had done it, case said.\n\ni was totally afraid to make the leap. what we talk about in the book or what i talk to readers about is getting outside of your comfort zone. it's so easy to get locked in a place where you're comfortable and everything's okay, but it's not really the life we aspire to. i like to say no things that are great come from the comfort zone. you have to get a little uncomfortable and push yourself.\n\nshe said she was totally afraid to make the leap, but she had to get outside her comfort zone.\n\ni like to say no things that are great come from the comfort zone. you have to get a little uncomfortable and push yourself, case said.\n\nbe fearless is published by simon & schuster, a division of cbs.
the white house said thursday that they would declare a national emergency in order to fund a barrier along the southern border. but the move is almost certain to invite challenges.\n\npresident trump has long claimed that there is a crisis at the border due to the high number of people seeking to cross into the u.s. (though he does not differentiate between illegal immigrants and asylum seekers). and he has repeatedly threatened to bypass congress and use emergency funds to build a wall, which was one of his core campaign promises during the 2016 election.\n\namid urging from some congressional conservatives, the administration says it will move forward with an emergency declaration. the president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country, white house press secretary sarah sanders said thursday.\n\nwhat is the national emergencies act?\n\nironically, the national emergencies act of 1975 was intended to constrain the power of the presidency, to create a structure for the president to declare national emergencies in the post-watergate era. under that law, the president can declare a national emergency, but must outline the specific emergency powers he is using under existing statutes. so mr. trump would have to justify his actions using acts already passed by congress.\n\nwhich statutes could mr. trump use to build the wall?\n\nthere are a few statutes which could allow the administration to use pentagon money to build the wall, once he declares a national emergency. one would allow the secretary of defense to undertake military construction projects which are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\n\nanother statute allows the pentagon to apply the resources of the department of the army's civil works program, and to reprogram those resources to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. despite its name, the army corps of engineers is made up almost entirely of civilians who administer construction contracts, so troops wouldn't actually be building the wall.\n\nthere are a couple of other smaller streams of money that would be available to the president, too, if he were to declare a national emergency. the defense secretary is permitted to undertake a military construction project if the project is vital to the national security, but only $50 million is allocated for that each year, far short of mr. trump's $5.7 billion request.\n\nunder the immigration and nationality act, the president can declare an immigration emergency, which is defined as when an actual or imminent influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the united states is beyond the existing capabilities. a state attorney general can request the president's response to an immigration emergency and detail what is needed to address it. however, only $20 million is available under that statute.\n\ncould congress overturn the declaration of a national emergency?\n\ncongress can cancel a national emergency, but it would require a rare amount of bipartisanship. congress would have to approve a joint resolution disapproving the national emergency, which would easily pass the democratic-controlled house but could face opposition in the republican-majority senate. if both houses pass the joint resolution, it would require the president's signature, and mr. trump would be unlikely to sign a bill which overturns his own declaration.\n\ncongress would then have to pass the joint resolution with a veto-proof majority, meaning that two-thirds of both houses would have to approve the bill. some congressional republicans, such as sens. john cornyn and susan collins, have in recent weeks indicated that they do not support an emergency declaration.\n\nwhat about a legal challenge?\n\nsome argue that legal precedent set by the 1953 supreme court case youngstown v. sawyer prevents the president from using this power. in that case, the court found that the attempted nationalization of steel mills by president harry truman using his commander-in-chief power was unconstitutional.\n\nthe decision imposed fundamental constitutional limits on the president's power to claim that a national emergency — in this case, the korean war — allowed him to override express provisions preventing him from using those powers domestically, said yale law professor bruce ackerman in an opinion piece in the new york times last week. democrats are also citing youngstown v. sawyer as evidence that mr. trump can't call a national emergency to build a border wall.\n\nlook, if harry truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border, rep. adam schiff, chairman of the house intelligence committee, told cnn sunday. so that's a non-starter.\n\nackerman also argued in his piece that calling a national emergency to build a wall would be illegal because of statutes saying that military forces could not be used for domestic purposes.
however heated the debate over guns and civilians, few question the importance of firepower for our armed forces. here's david martin:\n\nthere are gun lovers -- and then there are marines.\n\nto a marine infantryman like sgt. joshua sherman, his weapon may mean the difference between success and failure, life and death.\n\nour weapon system is basically your tool to keep yourself and your friends alive and then do the job at hand, he said.\n\nmarines refer to their rifle as she -- like a girlfriend.\n\nwhen you push forward and you're actually in iraq, in afghanistan or wherever the marine corps might send you, that weapon never leaves your side, sgt. sherman said.\n\nhe's holding an m4, the newest rifle to be issued to marines. his battle buddy, corporal shamar methany, is carrying the older m16. the m4 has a slightly shorter range, but it's two pounds lighter.\n\ntwo pounds is a lot when you're counting everything that you're trying to put on an infantry marine, sgt. sherman said.\n\nthe m4 is the latest rifle - shorter and lighter - to be issued to the corps. cbs news\n\nthe barrel of the m4 is also six inches shorter, which doesn't mean much out on the firing range, but could mean everything in urban combat.\n\nif you're coming around a corner into a hallway, inches can mean a big difference when it's showing whether you're coming or not, he said.\n\nall the rifles are becoming smaller and lighter, but col. roger turner -- the man in charge of developing new weapons for the marines -- says the addition of a telescopic scope is the biggest change. every rifle has one, not just sniper rifles, so that what would be considered a sniper-like effect can be achieved by this by every single marine, col. turner said.\n\nthe real snipers are creeping through the woods carrying a very different kind of weapon designed to pick off the enemy at long range. like the camouflage suit sgt. jacob ruiz is wearing, his rifle is custom-tailored.\n\ni don't imagine there's anybody that has a closer relationship with his weapon than a sniper, martin said.\n\nsnipers definitely fire far more rounds with a lot more responsibility and understanding what that round is doing than any other formal infantry, sgt. ruiz replied.\n\nas with the infantry rifles, the marines are switching to a smaller, lighter sniper rifle.\n\nsgt. jarod chambers says he will miss his weapon (this is all i've known since i've came to this), but he can console himself with the fact the new model is four pounds lighter.\n\nwe have a thing over there: ounces equal pounds, and pounds equal pain, said sgt. chambers. so the less ounces you've got, the less pain you're going to have.\n\neach rifle in a marine fire team has a different purpose. the snipers are usually first to fire, trying to pick off high-value targets, like enemy machine guns, giving the rest of the fire team a chance to move across open ground.\n\nmachine gunner ryan moore is the first to come up, laying down a base of fire.\n\nthat could be risky, said martin.\n\nwhen i was in afghanistan it definitely seemed that a machine gunner had a nice target painted on his flak jacket for the enemy to shoot at, moore said.\n\nthe weapon's drum contains 200 rounds, which he fires in two- to three-second bursts. any longer and the gun's recoil will make his shots go wild.\n\nin my opinion, for the most part machine guns will actually change or paint the actual outcome of the battle space, said moore. i'm going to instill confidence in my squad and their ability to move forward, and then i'm also going to put that fear in the enemy where they don't want to fight.\n\nthese marines could spend all day telling you about the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of their weapons, but here's the one thing you really need to know about a marine and his rifle:\n\nit is a very personal thing, and it's something that you take ownership of, said sgt. sherman. if there's something wrong with it, it's something you didn't do properly, not the weapon itself. you fix it, you make it better, then you get back in the fight.\n\nso the weapon is only as good as the marine? asked martin.\n\nabsolutely, sir. a weapon is going to do what it's designed to do. marines are trained to make it do what it's designed to do.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\nmore from guns and america:

nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: i'm margaret brennan in washington. and this week on face the nation, the government's plan to vaccinate americans is already showing signs of strain, as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths climbs higher than ever, and concern over a new variant of the virus grows. it's been a sobering start to 2021. bad behavior over the holidays, as defined by cdc guidelines, threatens to make january the deadliest month, yet, in years since the virus was discovered. the u.s. has now recorded over twenty million infections, a number that's doubled in the last eight weeks. in some parts of the country hospitals, morgues, and funeral homes are at or overcapacity. health care workers are overwhelmed.\n\ntoya senior (cedars-sinai nurse): if you don't know, things are pretty bad. things are really bad. please, everyone, do your part. wear a mask, stay home, and help us reduce the strain on us because we need help.\n\nmargaret brennan: pictures of people waiting in long lines are now of those desperate for a covid-19 shot.\n\nsylvester turner: even though that there's a-- there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy, there's still a strong desire from people to get the vaccine.\n\nmargaret brennan: but there is chaos and lack of coordination at all levels with the vaccine distribution. even those in charge of the efforts say it's not a question of availability.\n\nmoncef slaoui: there's a learning curve into the system and we're going through it, particularly, a number of days have been, quote, unquote, lost because of the holidays or snowstorms.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with the chief adviser or operation warp speed, doctor moncef slaoui. plus, we'll here from los angeles mayor, eric garcetti. his city is ground zero for the holiday covid-19 surge. arkansas republican governor asa hutchinson will also join us, as well as former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb, and the head of the association representing tens of millions of america's seniors, aarp's jo ann jenkins. then, a preview of tuesday's georgia runoff elections. those outcomes will determine control of the senate. will the state that went from red to blue in november see enough democrats turn out to defeat not one, but two republican senators?\n\nit's all just ahead on face the nation.\n\ngood morning, and welcome to face the nation. as we begin the new year, optimism over the prospect of vaccinations is facing the reality of delays, confusion, lack of communication, and, once more, a federal government seemingly without a coherent plan for making the millions of doses already manufactured accessible to americans. overwhelmed states, many struggling with this latest surge, have been left in charge of getting the vaccine to americans, and they're having a hard time doing so. meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb. more than three hundred and fifty thousand people have now died of covid-19 in the u.s. california is the new epicenter of this latest outbreak. cbs news correspondent carter evans reports from los angeles.\n\n(begin vt)\n\ncarter evans: with a new year comes new hope.\n\n(crowd cheering)\n\ncarter evans: but while vaccinations are underway across the nation--\n\nman: it means seeing my grandkids a lot. that means everything.\n\ncarter evans: --they're not happening fast enough. the trump administration promised twenty million doses would be given by the end of 2020. but the cdc says just over four million people have been inoculated. part of the problem is finding enough medical professionals to administer the shots.\n\nrich mackinnon: the local boards of health have been overworked, a lot of them are understaffed.\n\ncarter evans: and there's the time involved, including a fifteen- to thirty-minute observation period after the shot is given. another delay: vaccine skepticism. a new survey finds twenty-nine percent of health care workers are vaccine-hesitant. the growing covid surge is pushing hospitals in southern california to the breaking point.\n\ntoya senior (cedars-sinai nurse): things are pretty bad. things are really bad. we're overwhelmed. we're stressed. we're-- we're stretched so thin. it's pretty unimaginable.\n\ncarter evans: some hospitals in the epicenter of l.a. county are already diverting ambulances. others are preparing emergency plans for rationing care. and now the army corps of engineers is mobilizing to update oxygen delivery systems at hospitals in l.a. new covid cases here are up almost one thousand percent since november. one in every five people tested is now positive, and statewide covid kills someone every three minutes. morgues are overflowing, the dead now filling refrigerated trucks outside. across the country in north carolina, workers are setting up field hospitals, preparing for a new surge after the holidays. same story in atlanta, where they're converting the convention center into a medical center again.\n\n(end vt)\n\ncarter evans: today marks the end of the busy holiday travel period. the tsa says in the last two weeks, it's screened more than eleven million passengers. that, plus the tens of millions who likely traveled by road, has experts concerned another surge may be coming right about the time president-elect joe biden is being sworn in. margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: carter evans, thanks.\n\naround the world, other countries--most notably israel--are outpacing the u.s. when it comes to vaccinating their populations. as a percentage of population, israel stands at 12.6 percent, while the u.s. is at just one percent behind bahrain, iceland, and the u.k. cbs news senior foreign correspondent liz palmer reports from london.\n\nelizabeth palmer (cbs news senior foreign correspondent/@cbslizpalmer): good morning. those numbers point to the inequality of access to vaccine around the world. at this point, the developed countries with thirteen percent of the population have locked in more than half of the world's vaccine supply.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nelizabeth palmer: it's india's giant pharmaceutical manufacturers that will be key to making enough vaccines, hundreds of millions of doses for the world, especially developing countries and, of course, for itself. the indian government staged a dry run for a gargantuan program that will try to inoculate a million and a half people a day.\n\nwoman #1: you see how short of breath you are.\n\nelizabeth palmer: but as vaccinations gathered speed, so did the virus. extra contagious strains, one of them in south africa, have pushed up the death rate alarmingly.\n\nwoman #2: so, it's scary. it's scary for us all.\n\nelizabeth palmer: one in london has hit hard, too, and hospitals are at full capacity. so, it was a huge relief when regulators approved the cheap and easily stored oxford-astrazeneca vaccine just before the new year. tomorrow, it will be rolled out in britain with such urgency that for now people will only get one shot of it or the pfizer vaccine, instead of the recommended two, to make supplies go further. israel's vaccine program is in full swing. it hopes to be the first country in the world to immunize all its citizens by sometime in march. that's likely to be before some countries in africa even get started. covid ruined most new year's parties. in london, small groups of people hoping for fireworks were chased away by mounted police.\n\nman: start clearing the area please. you should not be gathering here.\n\nelizabeth palmer: but here and there, as in taiwan, where covid is firmly under control, crowds welcomed what the rest of the world so craves: a healthy 2021.\n\n(end vt)\n\nelizabeth palmer: widespread and truly global vaccine has to be well underway before things like safe travel for all of us can resume. and epidemiologists say that's not likely to happen until at least 2023. margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: liz palmer, thank you.\n\nwe want to go now to the chief adviser for the u.s. vaccine effort, that's operation warp speed. doctor moncef slaoui joins us from miami. good morning to you, doctor.\n\nmoncef slaoui, phd (operation warp speed chief adviser): good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: have u.s. officials gotten any insight into how this more contagious version of the virus that's detected in the u.k. and south africa, what the impact is? we know it's from the u.k. at least-- that version is in at least three u.s. states.\n\nmoncef slaoui: yes, so that's the information we have. the virus-- this virus actually mutates as part of its normal behavior and, therefore, it is normal to expect that there will be variants. what's very important is to study those variants and understand how infectious they are, whether they have more impact in terms of morbidity or mortality, and critically now, whether they are still sensitive to the vaccines that have been developed. and on those three counts, based on the information shared with us by the u.k. scientists and early data that we have here, we think that these viruses, these various variants should be under control with this vaccine. fortunately, they are not more deadly--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --to the population. they are more infectious, and, therefore, they will further exacerbate the surge that we are having.\n\nmargaret brennan: there are reports, though, in the u.k. that more children are becoming ill. from the models you've seen, what does this new virus strain do to children?\n\nmoncef slaoui: well, its-- and its capacity to spread is higher. frankly, i'm-- i'm not very clear about the data showing a differential in accelerated spread between adults and children, but the fact of the matter is it will spread faster into the population. i think it should be a signal, again, to say what we need to do as a population is wear masks, distance ourselves, wash our hands, be very aware of people around us and continue to be very careful around the transmission.\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\nmoncef slaoui: this will continue to happen. the key to the solution is vaccination.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, let's get to that solution then because it is the fastest vaccine development in western history. congratulations to you as overseeing that part of it. now, we're at the really complicated part of actually getting it to americans. the president twice this week has blamed the states for failing to distribute it. if they're not up to the task, what are you doing in operation warp speed to help them?\n\nmoncef slaoui: well, first, as you said, i think let's-- let me acknowledge the progress that's been made, which has been remarkable, and it's the work of tens of thousand or probably hundreds of thousands of people--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --to have been able to have five vaccines in phase three trials, two approved, probably one more to be approved in the next four to six weeks and twenty million doses of vaccines that we-- as we had promised would be made available to the american people to be immunized with have been made available: seventeen and a half million have been shipped. now, we do acknowledge--\n\nmargaret brennan: right, but only a third of them have actually been used. so that's-- that's--\n\nmoncef slaoui: yes, absolutely.\n\nmargaret brennan: --where the rubber meets the road.\n\nmoncef slaoui: we need to improve. exactly--\n\nmargaret brennan: so, what do you do in the states to help them?\n\nmoncef slaoui: we need to improve on that. i-- so, we have visited actually the states. and i know you have the governor from arkansas with you later on today. we, general perna and myself, have visited the department of health in arkansas. we have explained the process. this was on october 26th. arkansas has actually ordered from the central reserve about a hundred and fifty thousand doses of the vaccine. hundred and twenty some thousands have been delivered to the actual locations that they have told us. therefore, our assumption has been that there is a plan in place to immunize. we stand by here to help any specific request. we will do the best we can, as we have done over the last eight months, to make these vaccines, indeed, make it into the arms of people.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmoncef slaoui: but we need to have a specific ask and maybe there will be one later on today.\n\nmargaret brennan: i-- well, we will ask him--\n\nmoncef slaoui: there hasn't been a specific request.\n\nmargaret brennan: but, sir, i know you know what these numbers are right now. we are at a peak level of infection. so figuring out the bureaucracy--\n\nmoncef slaoui: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --seems to be, you know, frustrating for people here because they want it now. so, what about jumpstarting--\n\nmoncef slaoui: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --the plan you have in place? you know, cvs and walgreens say they have-- they are expecting to get the vaccine in the spring to distribute to the population at large. why not give it to them now? if the states are having a problem, go to the private sector.\n\nmoncef slaoui: well, we, as you know, we have agreement with cvs and walgreens and we are starting to ship vaccines to those locations as allocated by the states. that's really the key point in-- in the approach--\n\nmargaret brennan: right, but that's the problem, isn't it?\n\nmoncef slaoui: --we have taken.\n\nmargaret brennan: that's why i'm saying, like, why can't you help that?\n\nmoncef slaoui: i don't think it's a problem, frankly-- i actually-- well, we are here to help. let me just, for instance, say over the last seventy-two hours 1.5 million vaccine doses have been inoculated. even though there is a gap in reporting. that's quite an important number. that's five hundred thousand a day. we are optimistic as we go beyond this holiday season that the numbers will go up and we are standing ready to do what we are asked. where there is help to be given, we're standing by to help. i don't think we are able to identify exactly which long-term care facility or which cvs store should be getting more vaccine or less vaccine. that has to be done with people that have granular knowledge of their population, their movements, where the older people are, or, you know, the--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmoncef slaoui --various groups at risk--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --and then we'll be there with them.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay, so you're saying that still has to be up to the states to figure out where they have the need. but let's talk about the portion you can control, and that is the federal supply. if the goal is preservation of life, how can you still justify holding back more than half of the manufactured doses that you have? you know we just heard from the u.k. that they're just trying to hit as many people at once. why not do something like that and space out the time between doses?\n\nmoncef slaoui: yes, so a scientific answer and then an alternative. i think it's not reasonable when vaccines have been developed with two doses given twenty-one days apart, or twenty-eight days given apart, and where we have the data on their safety and their efficacy and we have no-- after two doses. we have no data after one dose. if we leave people a month, two months, three months with maybe incomplete immunity, waning immunity, maybe even the wrong kind of immune response induced, that is then corrected by the second dose--\n\nmargaret brennan: but they've got zero immunity right now.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --to give them-- well, it is-- we-- i'm-- i'm going to tell you the alternative in one second. just let me finish the point i'm making, which is we always said that these vaccines will be developed on the basis of science and all decisions will be made transparently on the basis of data. changing the decisions made, the choices made, which was to give two doses of vaccine, the second dose gives you ten times higher immune response than the first dose, without any data i think would not be responsible. here is the alternative. we know that for the moderna vaccine, giving half the dose to people between the age of eighteen and fifty-five, two doses, half the dose, which means exactly achieving the objective of immunizing double the number of people with the doses we have. we know it induces identical immune response to the hundred microgram dose and, therefore, we are in discussion with moderna and with the fda. of course, ultimately it will be an fda decision to accelerate--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --injecting half the volume. i think that's a more responsible approach that will be based on facts and data--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nmoncef slaoui: --to immunize more people. and, of course, we continue to produce more vaccine doses.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah. and, quickly, do you have a date for when you will know whether once you've been vaccinated, you can still give the virus to others? is there any timeline?\n\nmoncef slaoui: so that-- those-- no. those studies, frankly, are going to be based on observational data into the population. i don't think we will have data before late in the spring.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nmoncef slaoui: but i can't give you an exact date.\n\nmargaret brennan: doctor slaoui, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nand face the nation will be back in a minute with los angeles mayor eric garcetti. so stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're back now with the mayor of los angeles, one of the cities struggling with the pandemic. eric garcetti is our guest. good morning to you.\n\nmayor eric garcetti (d-los angeles/@mayorofla): good morning, margaret. good to be with you.\n\nmargaret brennan: you are at the epicenter of this outbreak right now; and i saw you said a high percentage of deaths are among people with no underlying conditions. why is the virus so deadly right now?\n\nmayor eric garcetti: well, we're seeing a person every six seconds contract covid-19 here in los angeles county, i think the nation's largest county, ten million people. and it's two reasons, one is just simple density. we're the densest metro area in the united states. but we're also seeing the household spread now. one person is coming home, an essential worker, there might be five, seven, ten people in that household. and this is a worrying trend that the fatalities now are not just people with pre-existing conditions. ninety-two percent of previous deaths were people who had an underlying condition. that is rapidly falling. so, my message to everybody is this is not only going to come for somebody that you love. this is going to possibly come for you. and so everything we do is either lifesaving or life-taking at this point.\n\nmargaret brennan: is the higher incidence of death due in any way to the fact that you have a shortage of medical personnel?\n\nmayor eric garcetti: there's no question that we have a shortage of medical personnel, but that's not yet why we think those deaths are happening. we think it is spreading. it may be mutating as well, but we do believe that this is just how widespread it is and that a lot of people who are younger or don't have pre-existing conditions have become very comfortable. this is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. ninety-five percent of people can be doing the right thing. it's still dangerous.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: mm-hm.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: if eighty percent are doing the right thing, it is disastrous. so, while we have high compliance here, we still have these tough months. and i think the vaccine has made everybody so hopeful that they can relax their behavior. we cannot. we cannot let up. this is the darkest month we will have, the toughest moment when both our country, its government and the nation-- our people will be tested.\n\nmargaret brennan: you have a mask mandate. i mean you're saying that some people are just not complying with some of the restrictions you've put in place. you had that targeted stay-at-home order in early december. do you think that you waited too long to institute that?\n\nmayor eric garcetti: no. we have great compliance. we look at our data. people are moving less. i was talking to the head of the red cross out here who just moved from another state. she was blown away by how many people wear masks compared to where she was coming from. this is something now that really is spreading in the home. and once you get past that tipping point, and it's a message for all of america, we might not all have the same density as los angeles. but what's happening in los angeles can and will be coming to many communities across america. if you get two households together for christmas, if you went to a new year's gathering even if it was people you know and love so you thought it was okay. that's when this virus exploits that weakness and is going far. l.a. was the first place to close places down that-- where people meet, have a mask mandate, offer widespread testing to folks with or without symptoms, surge into our senior and skilled nursing facilities--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: --where we arrested most of the deaths there. we've done everything right. but this virus doesn't care what you've done in the past, only what you're doing today.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the vaccine that is being distributed now? you've publicly called for the vaccine manufacturers and the federal government to deliver more, but it's your governor who controls the distribution. is he not giving you what you need?\n\nmayor eric garcetti: no, we-- we have not been delivered what was promised at the national level. i mean i know and thank god for the great work that was done nationally. let me give that praise for developing and helping the private sector get these vaccines. but we are at a pace right now to deliver vaccines in los angeles in over five years instead of over half a year at this pace.\n\nmargaret brennan: right, but you just heard the head of operation warp speed lay that firmly at the door of the governors in this country.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: well, i respectfully disagree because i said six months ago, calling with senator chris coons and a bipartisan coalition in washington for a care corps, a cares corps that would have trained people for all sorts of things, including vaccine distribution, while washington dithered, while they went on vacations, while they didn't pass a relief bill for seven or eight months--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: --we could have been training out of work folks and students to be ready. we knew that the surge was coming in the winter. we also knew that the same medical personnel who would need to give the vaccines, if we were lucky to get them by the end of the year and we did, would also be pulled into those hospitals to treat people.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: where was the forward planning?\n\nmargaret brennan: well, the federal government keeps saying the forward planning was supposed to be with local government. and the city of los angeles, we know, you-- you were talking about the uniqueness of your city in terms of density. you also have a high homeless population. you've had sixteen-percent rise in the year past. well, how are you planning to deal with that problem and getting vaccine into those members of your community? because that's-- that's your problem as mayor?\n\nmayor eric garcetti: absolutely. and we've actually had a lower incidence of covid-19 among our un-housed population than those of us in housing because of the way we did plan. and we did bring medical personnel to the streets and we have distributed masks. and that is a great platform to help make sure that vaccines are going to go to the most vulnerable. in fact, this week we stood up three and we're about to do four more seven community walk-up vaccine sites for folks that are working right now in some of our community clinics, working on places like skid row. but to go to your point earlier, the federal government can't tell the local governments and state governments to do something and not give us aid.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah. well--\n\nmayor eric garcetti: we were cut out of that federal assistance that we could have put into. i said the cares corps would have been--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: --not federal people coming in, but local folks hiring locally. and they failed to do--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: --that.\n\nmargaret brennan: governor, we wish you well. and i know-- i know your daughter was recently ill. i hope she is recovering. thank you for--\n\nmayor eric garcetti: she is.\n\nmargaret brennan: --your time. we have a lot more face the nation.\n\nmayor eric garcetti: thank you, margaret. strength and love to you.\n\nmargaret brennan: stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: the house will convene today in a rare sunday session to swear in the new congress, but one person who will not be there is louisiana republican luke letlow. he died last week of covid-19. the congressman was forty-one years old, with a wife, two small children and no pre-existing conditions.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we want to go now to governor asa hutchinson of arkansas, who is also the vice chair of the nationals gov-- national governors association. he joins us from little rock. good morning to you, governor.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson (r-arkansas/@asahutchinson): good morning, margaret. good to be with you.\n\nmargaret brennan: i'm glad we have you today to talk about the vaccine and distribution. i want to quickly ask you something though on the political front as a republican. nearly a quarter of senate republicans say they have concerns about voter integrity, and plan on wednesday to challenge joe biden's electoral college win. this is, to be very clear, all but certain to fail in terms of changing the outcome of the election. but other republican senators say this is destructive to do in the first place. where do you stand?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: well, it's a-- a process that they have the right to initiate. i think it's a little bit of a don quixote jousting at windmills efforts. i think it is designed-- certainly it will fail. joe biden is our president-elect and he will be confirmed in that capacity. i do think that from a state perspective, the challenges have been initiated through recounts and court challenges. and that's how we work in our electoral college, state by state. and so when it gets to congress, it's really a limited opportunity to review the intricacies of the election process. we should have confidence in what has been done and the reviews and the recounts. and let's all recognize that while the system is not perfect, it worked state by state, and we should accept those results and move on to do some good things for our country.\n\nmargaret brennan: so i understand you do not support that effort. thank you for your clarification there, governor. i want to move on to the virus. the cdc says arkansas has only distributed a third of the vaccines that you have been given. what's the biggest challenge getting the doses into arms?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: well, there are a number of challenges and we've got to do better both at the federal and at the state level. one of the challenges is that we have a limited supply. and when you have a limited supply that means you've got to prioritize and you've got to make sure you're giving it to those with the greatest needs, or those of the greatest risk. and that's a challenge in and of itself. secondly, you do have some reluctance and that creates some complications. we're focusing on our long-term care facilities and that has to have consents in many instances and that slows up the process. but even with that, we have to do better.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: we have to act with a sense of urgency and we can do that. we have to learn whenever you're in a battle that you have to adjust to the circumstances of that battle.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: and right now, we're going to have to make some adjustments in the plan to get these vaccines out.\n\nmargaret brennan: you heard the head of operation warp speed say that they were working under the assumption that there is a plan in place to immunize at the state level. was there not a plan in arkansas? i mean that seems to be the implication here, that it is the governors who are dropping the ball.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: no, there has-- there is a plan and that plan has been coordinated at the federal level, but let me lay it out for you. in phase one, we're supposed to be doing our health care workers and we're doing our long-term care facilities, residents and staff. the federal government allocates that based upon where we want it to go, but they're working through the pharmacies and they made a contract with walgreens and with cvs, two major chain pharmacies. but the states can or-- or the local long-term care facilities can opt out. sixty percent of ours opted out for independent pharmacies. they're doing a better job of getting it out than the chain pharmacies. they are acting with more urgency. and so that's an example of where i have learned that whenever you look now at the challenges with a specific population, what it's going to be like when we move to essential workers and whenever we move--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: --to the general population, we're going to have to utilize more resources to get this out than we've got planned right now.\n\nmargaret brennan: what-- what have the other states told you is their difficulty? is it all the same that you're laying out, the problems with the nursing homes?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: yes. it is the-- the challenge of the work staff, the fact that we don't have enough right now for our nurses. we have to utilize our pharmacies because they have the capability and relationships to get it out. but we're going to have to look more broadly at how to utilize more resources, whether it is utilizing medical personnel that's already strained in terms of our national guard, whether it is--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: --bringing on pharmaceutical students that can do more in terms of giving these vaccinations out. we've got to increase the capacity--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: --of our human resources.\n\nmargaret brennan: you have the world's largest retailer headquartered in your home state. they have a massive logistics hub. have you asked walmart to help you out?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: walmart is ready to help. this is an example of where--\n\nmargaret brennan: would it be better if the private sector took this over?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: the private sector is very engaged. the private sector is doing it, both the independent pharmacies as well as the chain pharmacies. and so, the private sector is delivering it--\n\nmargaret brennan: but if the federal government gave directly to them versus you?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: the federal government is giving directly to them. all we're doing as a state is telling them where it goes and allocate it.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: the delivery is directly to the private sector and they're getting it out, but not as fast as we would like. and so it's a partnership. and you're going to see these numbers increase dramatically in the next week--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: --ten days. i believe by the end of january, you'll have all of 1a vaccinated and we'll be moving on to essential workers, if not sooner than that.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. i ask you that because the head of operation warp speed again said allocation came down to what the governors asked for and where they told them to send it. so, it just continues to be--\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: that's correct.\n\nmargaret brennan: --ping-pong here. so on the federal guidance, though--\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: now, it's-- it's saying the same thing, margaret, it's saying the same thing. we are allocating where it goes. they deliver it to where we say and that's to the private sector right now.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. the federal government right now is telling states to prioritize people seventy-five years old and up along with front-line workers. there are state governors, florida, texas, who have moved the age qualification downwards, right, to hit more of their elderly population. are you going to do that or are you going to stick with what the federal government's telling you to do?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: we're looking at reducing that to seventy, as well. the argument that it should be allocated seventy-five and up first is because there's a limited supply. it might be easier for you to distribute it and know exactly who you're distributing it to. but the seventy and up population we're looking at, we're trying to save lives getting to the most vulnerable first. and so we're still looking at that as to whether that should be lowered. that decision will be forthcoming.\n\nmargaret brennan: so you may endorse what governors abbott and desantis are doing?\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: we're looking at that.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: it may happen. we're also looking at some other modifications to the recommendation of the cdc, which is simply recommendations to the governors.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. governor hutchinson, thank you very much and good luck to you.\n\ngovernor asa hutchinson: thank you, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll be right back with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb. stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we want to go now to former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb. he's also on the board at pfizer and he joins us from westport, connecticut. good morning to you.\n\nscott gottlieb, m.d. (former fda commissioner/@scottgottliebmd): good morning.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've said january is going to be the hardest month. i'm-- i'm looking at this slower-than-expected rollout and this new strain of coronavirus. does all of this come together to mean that the peak will be extended, that this is going to be painful for a longer period?\n\nscott gottlieb: it's possible. you know we were hoping that we'd have more injections in people's arms at this point and the vaccine could be starting to have an impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. and the new variant certainly creates more risk that this epidemic peak could get extended. we're going to see the epidemic probably peak at some point this month, hopefully earlier in the month. i mean, that was the original estimates and the original modeling. but the lag in terms of the effect on a health care system is going to be about three weeks. and so the health care system is not going to see maximal resource utilization told closer to the end of the month. and that's when we're likely to see the peak number of deaths on a daily basis as well. so we still have a ways to go with this current surge of this epidemic until we start to see cases decline, hospitalizations start to decline, and, hopefully, deaths start to decline. the new variant does create a lot of risk, however, that we start to see accelerated spread.\n\nmargaret brennan: what new risks? doctor slaoui said that it seems the vaccines do work against it. what risks are you seeing?\n\nscott gottlieb: well, we're not vaccinating quickly enough to create a backstop against the spread of this new variant. right now there's some estimates that the new-- new variant probably represents about one percent of all infections in this country. by march, it's going to be the majority of infections. it's going to grow quickly. and so one of the-- the real key to controlling this new variant is to control the epidemic. that means doing the things that we've been doing, mask wearing, social distancing, but it also means getting more people vaccinated quickly. i think that the-- the existence of this new variant that spreads more readily really creates more urgency around trying to get this vaccine out more quickly and get more people vaccinated, even if it's a more general population. there's a lot of excess demand for the vaccine right now, particularly in the elderly population. i think we ought to think about moving quickly through these phases that we've delineated and move more quickly into a general vaccination program for those sixty-five and above.\n\nmargaret brennan: i-- i thought it was, interesting. governor hutchinson sort of leaned into that concept, saying they were looking at what the governors of florida and texas have done with making this available to other age populations at this point. would you ask of-- other governors to do that? because governor desantis was really kind of hit hard by, you know, images of long lines of older people waiting. it didn't seem to be moving quickly in terms of vaccinations, though, he widened the number of people who qualify for it.\n\nscott gottlieb: well, i think we can have a dual strategy here where we continue to prioritize certain hard to reach communities and have public health departments focus on that mission. and they're uniquely skilled to do that mission and then make the vaccine more generally available through the retail pharmacies, through walmart and walgreens and cvs, to a broader population, to a general population starting with age. we can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for seventy-five and above first, then seventy above, then sixty-five and above. there's fifty million americans sixty-five and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. at some point we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the-- the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination. if we're pushing it through the retail pharmacies, you're not going to see the long lines. they're going to have a scheduling system in place and it's going to be a more orderly distribution. and then, commensurate with that, we can have the public health departments focusing on the critical mission of going into homes, reaching harder-to-access communities, people who are more reluctant and need a little bit more encouragement to get vaccinated.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nscott gottlieb: that's someplace where the public health establishment can really focus on a discernible mission.\n\nmargaret brennan: but explain that because you have operation warp speed saying it is working with the private sector. you had the gov-- the governor of arkansas saying they are working with the private sector. are you saying that the private sector should just take it over at this point?\n\nscott gottlieb: well, look, we've-- we have forty million vaccines that-- that were delivered in december. five million were injected into arms. that's thirty-five million vaccines sitting on a shelf somewhere. i'm saying that we can be delivering these vaccines directly to walmart and walgreens, and in new jersey they're shipping them through shoprite, and allow these retail establishments to start opening up more general vaccination programs for the broader public instead of working very slowly through these preordained phases that we've-- we've articulated. continue to-- to accomplish that mission because it's important, but also take some of this excess supply and push it through a retail channel to the general public. if someone who's seventy years old or sixty-five years old wants to schedule an appointment at cvs to get a vaccination, they should be able to do that this month. so i think we should start working through the age brackets and just work our way down until we work off some of the supply. there's more vaccine coming on the market every day. we're going to have a significant backlog right now or, you know, warehouse inventory of vaccines.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nscott gottlieb: and that's tragic because these could be accomplishing an important public health purpose.\n\nmargaret brennan: right. well, because operation warp speed is already stockpiling half-- more than half of the supply that they have. what about vaccine-hesitancy? the-- the governor of ohio said sixty percent of nursing home staff members offered the vaccine in his state declined it. you're seeing similar hesitancy elsewhere. these are medical personnel and health care staff and they're saying no.\n\nscott gottlieb: yeah, look, that's another reason to be making this more generally accessible. it is a reality that some people aren't going to want to get vaccinated, or are going to be reluctant to get vaccinated. it's going to take more work. there's about a hundred and fifty million americans who get vaccinated for flu each year. about sixty million of them are under the age of fifteen. so that's about ninety million people who get vaccinated for flu. i think that's your low hanging fruit for getting covid vaccinations out. some high proportion of the people who get a flu vaccine are also going to get a covid vaccine. if we just simply make this generally accessible to sixty-five and above this month, that's fifty million americans, probably about thirty million of them will take it. that's your low hanging fruit. that's the pent-up demand. we need to start working that off because trying to push it into, you know, very discrete populations, you're going to be bumping up against people who don't want it and it's going to create friction. it's going to create a slowdown in trying to get this vaccination out. we need to get more people vaccinated quickly and recognize that every vaccination--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nscott gottlieb: --at this point really is a public health win.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. doctor gottlieb, thank you for your analysis.\n\nand we'll be back in a moment.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we turn now to jo ann jenkins. she is the ceo of the american association of retired persons. you know it as aarp and she's at their headquarters in washington this morning. good morning to you.\n\njo ann jenkins (aarp ceo/@joann_jenkins): good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: december was a very deadly month during this pandemic, particularly for nursing home residents. the federal government plan is to have pharmacies like cvs and walgreens set up clinics to vaccinate inside of these facilities. and it started in about thirty-six states just this past week. is it moving fast enough?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think by every mea-- questionable that it has not moved fast enough that, you know, forty percent of the people who have died in this country live in nursing homes. and so, we see this really as an unconscionable national disaster that three hundred and fifty thousand people in this country have died from covid-19 and forty percent of them have lived in nursing homes or work in nursing homes, and, yet, they only represent one percent of the population. so, no, we're not moving fast enough.\n\nmargaret brennan: i didn't hear a lot of specifics from-- from the-- the governor or from the head of operation warp speed on what they want to change. and i'm wondering from you what your view is because we did hear earlier in the week from operation warp speed saying that some nursing homes aren't vaccinating until they have enough doses for everyone in the facility. that's a federal requirement. should the government suspend it?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think that, you know, if you look at the data and the fact that that's where people are dying, you have to come to the conclusion that they should be doing everything that they can to be administering this vaccine as soon as possible. i know that there are 2.2 million doses that have gone out to nursing homes, and, yet, only thirteen percent of that has been administered. and so we have to find a solution and, you know, we need to stop pointing fingers and--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\njo ann jenkins: --you know, looking at who-- who's to blame. and really all of us, whether it's mayors or governors or the federal or governors all across this country to really try to fix this problem.\n\nmargaret brennan: so that's a yes, they should lift that requirement?\n\njo ann jenkins: absolutely. yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: at-- at the state level you-- you heard a debate about whether the age qualification should be lowered more quickly, like it has been in texas and in florida. would you ask other governors to do that?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think if you look at the data of where people are dying and if, in fact we can stop people from dying of covid, we know that that will offer some relief to the hospitals all across this country. we have examples that we're hearing from thousands of our members, particularly like those in florida, who are standing in lines of three, four hundred of them at three and four o'clock in the morning trying to-- to get that vaccination. i think that we have to really solve this issue and really come together so that there is some standard for which the states and the local nursing homes know how they're going to get this vaccine and what it is they're supposed to be doing.\n\nmargaret brennan: there's confusion. i mean i know people who-- who ask-- where do i find out when i qualify? what do you tell your members? do they call their doctor? do they get an e-mail? who do they ask? their local health department?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think one of the things that we've tried to do at aarp is, you know, we have aarp.org/coronavirus where we're listing everything that we have from the states about what-- how the vaccine, the priorities in each of the states, how they're going to be able to get their vaccinations. clearly, we're hearing directly from our members that they are confused about whether or not they should be calling their physician, whether or not someone's going to contact them, which of the vaccines should they be trying to take if they live in rural america or in an urban city, just how that's going to happen. and i think that there could be some simple clarity and transparency about what is to be expected, the time frame that individuals all across this country should be thinking about. clearly, we need to keep up the protections of wearing mask and washing our hands and doing all of those things. we shouldn't let our guard down. but there needs to be further clarity about and-- and expectations set about when this vaccines are going to be administered widely.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you think that staff in nursing homes should be mandated to take the vaccine?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think that the data tells us that that's where the deaths are occurring and that for patients and people who work in nursing homes, they need to be protected in a way. but, clearly, it's not-- it's not ours to-- to mandate a vaccine--\n\nmargaret brennan: so, governors-- governors would have to mandate that, right? is that what you're asking governors to do?\n\njo ann jenkins: well, i think that we're saying to the governors that-- that this is a way to bring it under control and that while we at aarp don't have the authority to-- to mandate this, that this is one of the-- one of the only ways that we had that we know that this-- this particular covid-19 disease can be brought under control.\n\nmargaret brennan: right. and it may come down to employers. jo ann jenkins, thank you very much for-- for sharing what you're seeing out there.\n\nwe'll be right back with a look at tuesday's georgia's senate race. it's an important one. don't go away.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: in georgia a pair of runoff elections on tuesday will decide control of the u.s. senate and shape the agenda of the incoming biden administration. here's our senior national correspondent mark strassmann.\n\n(begin

you probably thought you were finished thinking about medicare when the 2018 open enrollment period ended on dec. 7. not so fast: medicare has another limited open enrollment that runs from jan. 1 through march 31, 2019, for medicare advantage plans. here's a brief review to help you understand your options.\n\nyou face a fundamental decision regarding how you receive medical treatment under medicare:\n\noriginal medicare usually gives you the most flexibility to choose your health care providers, but it's also the most complicated way to receive benefits. it's recommended that you supplement original medicare with a medicare supplement plan to help cover medicare's substantial deductibles and copayments\n\na medicare advantage (ma) plan offers one-stop shopping, typically combining all parts of medicare and prescription drug coverage. however, ma plans usually limit you to seeing only the health care providers in the plan's network.\n\nyou do have the opportunity to change your mind if you elected an ma plan during the 2018 open enrollment period or if you simply allowed your 2018 ma plan to remain effective for 2019. during the 2019 medicare advantage open enrollment period, you can:\n\nchange from one ma plan to another\n\nopt out of your ma plan and switch to original medicare\n\nelect a stand-alone part d prescription drug plan if you lose prescription drug coverage due to opting out of your ma plan\n\nyour election becomes effective the month after you make the switch.\n\nwhy would you want to move from one ma plan to another or to original medicare? here are a few possible reasons:\n\nmany ma plans change their benefits and coverage from year to year, and you may not have noticed until you tried to make a claim in 2019. often, changes are made to the prescription drug formulary\n\nyou might have incurred a serious medical condition and want more flexibility in choosing your providers under original medicare.\n\nyou might discover an ma plan that better meets your needs. for example, some offer limited vision or dental benefits that aren't covered by original medicare.\n\nif you're new to an ma plan this year, try it out before march 31, recommended diane omdahl, president of sixty-five incorporated, an independent medicare consultancy. that way, you can test whether you like it and still have time to change if you don't.\n\nnote that if you opt out of your ma plan and switch to original medicare, you may have a challenge purchasing a medicare supplement plan. most states allow insurance companies to require that you satisfy medical underwriting requirements to obtain coverage (insurance companies are prohibited from applying medical underwriting only when you're first eligible to enroll in medicare at age 65). so if you have a preexisting condition, you may not be able to elect a medicare supplement plan.\n\nhere are a few things you can't do during 2019 medicare advantage open enrollment:\n\nswitch from original medicare to an ma plan\n\nswitch from one prescription drug plan to another, if you're in original medicare\n\njoin a prescription drug plan if you're in original medicare and previously declined to enroll in such a plan.\n\nthere's a lot to keep track of with medicare and all its various parts and features. if you're confused, which is understandable, it's a good idea to find a professional who can help you. it's part of your retirement job to spend time learning about your options. smart choices can save you thousands of dollars and help keep you healthy.
pence and coronavirus task force hold press briefing vice president mike pence and members of the coronavirus task force gave a press briefing monday where they emphasized that the risk to americans remains low. health and human services secretary alex azar did warn, however, the degree of risk has the potential to change quickly. watch their remarks.
editor's note: health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. on friday, april 3, president trump announced that the cdc now recommends americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask, not a medical-grade mask, in public.\n\nas fears over the coronavirus outbreak spread, thousands of americans are clamoring to buy face masks in an effort to protect themselves, sending prices soaring and leading manufacturers like 3m to ramp up production. however, experts say stocking up on face masks is actually misguided — and there's a much simpler thing you could be doing right now to protect yourself.\n\nthere's a lot the general public likely doesn't realize about these masks — namely, that they are not the best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nwearing a mask is more for people already showing symptoms of coronavirus and their caregivers than for people trying to prevent it\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention said it does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid-19, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. rather, experts caution that putting on a face mask without proper fitting and training could actually increase your risk.\n\nif it's not fitted right, you're going to fumble with it, explained health and human services secretary alex azar before a house appropriations subcommittee on wednesday. you're going to be touching your face, which is the no. 1 way you're going to get disease, is unclean hands touching your face.\n\non the other hand, if you are already coughing and showing symptoms of possible coronavirus illness, that's when wearing a mask could be helpful for protecting those around you.\n\nthe data on the effectiveness of masks for preventing respiratory virus infections is not very clear,  explains dr. andrew stanley pekosz of johns hopkins' bloomberg school of public health. the best data suggests that if you are ill and showing symptoms, wearing a mask can reduce the chances that you spread the virus to others.\n\ncloth surgical masks are not helpful\n\nthe common surgical mask you might be picturing in your head will not help you at all, pekosz said.\n\na type called an n95 respirator mask, if properly fitted, can block large-particle droplets that may contain germs, but the fda warns they cannot filter out very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs [or] sneezes.\n\nan n95 mask is the one that is most practical, pekosz tells cbs news. it stops 95% of particles of a certain size. ... there is a n99 mask, which blocks 99% of particles, but that mask is difficult to wear for long periods of time because it is hard to breathe through it.\n\nrespirator masks are more expensive. the fda also notes they are not designed to fit children or people with facial hair.\n\neven a good face mask isn't enough\n\nmasks shouldn't be considered to be the sole item that can protect you from infection, but it can be one of several things that can help you stay uninfected, said pekosz.\n\nwash your hands frequently. practice social distancing — stay 5 feet away from people to avoid being close enough to be exposed to respiratory droplets from that person. more specific guidance will be given by the cdc soon, but those two things should be practiced by people on a daily basis to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\n\nand he adds, get a flu shot — influenza has killed over 16,000 americans this year and is still causing disease across the u.s.\n\nyou have to change masks every few hours\n\nif you do go the mask route in spite of expert advice, it's important to note that face masks have a very specific lifespan. while there are some with longer lifespans or that have replaceable filters, the most common face masks on the market are disposable and single use. each one of those is only good for a few hours.\n\nyou want to change masks every few hours to make sure that they are functioning properly and aren't getting contaminated with virus particles on the outside, pekosz tells cbs news. it's not like putting one on protects you. one has to follow specific procedures to ensure you are using them effectively.\n\nbuying face masks for personal use could cause a shortage at hospitals\n\nthere is a limited supply of masks and while companies are increasing their production, demand is increasing at a very high rate, cautions pekosz. there will most likely be shortages of personal protective equipment at medical institutions and this may in part be driven by supplies being purchased by the general public. emergency preparedness efforts will address supply chains, but there really is no reason for the general public to purchase large numbers of n95 masks.\n\nthe u.s. surgeon general put it bluntly: seriously people — stop buying masks!\n\nseriously people- stop buying masks! they are not effective in preventing general public from catching #coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\n\nhttps://t.co/uxzrwxxkl9 — u.s. surgeon general (@surgeon_general) february 29, 2020\n\namerica's largest face mask manufacturer, prestige ameritech, is a small business based in texas with only 100 employees. and while they have no problem fulfilling america's normal demand for face masks and respirators, they are now struggling to keep up.\n\nmike bowen, the company's executive vice president, told cbs news that they now field orders of up to 100 million face masks and respirators a day. he also noted that while the company does not ship its products internationally, in the last 30 days it has sold between 1 million and 2 million masks to buyers who then sent them to others in china and hong kong.\n\nthis huge spike in personal orders is precisely what experts fear will cause a dangerous inventory shortage in american hospitals — a shortage that is entirely avoidable, given that there are no proven benefits to the general public wearing masks.\n\nthe best way to prevent coronavirus: wash your hands\n\nexperts say washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of infectious illnesses like coronavirus. that's because one of the most common ways infections spread is when people touch a contaminated surface and then touch their mouth or nose.\n\nwash your hands frequently and thoroughly. cbs news chief medical correspondent dr. jon lapook points out that it's especially important to make sure that you scrub the soap into your fingertips because they are simultaneously the part of the hand most often neglected and the part of the hand most likely to touch your face and spread disease.\n\nsoap and water is far more effective than hand sanitizer. if you're using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, you should make sure that it contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nbeyond that, the cdc advises that, whenever possible, you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, avoid contact with sick people, cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze, and disinfect objects and surfaces frequently.
one of facebook's early investors and a former mentor to ceo mark zuckerberg is warning of the social media giant's harmful and potentially irreversible effects on society. roger mcnamee told cbs this morning on wednesday that facebook not only needs to take action, it needs to fix the product.\n\nmcnamee, managing director of private equity firm elevation partners, argues that facebook has prioritized advertisers and not protected users.\n\nthe facebook stakeholder said he spent years helping to build the company and finds it unbelievably painful to think about where it is today.\n\ni'm sitting in the front row like, wow, this is the greatest thing i ever did. then right in the beginning of the presidential campaign in 2016 i see things going wrong and it makes me very concerned. and eventually in october i go to them and say, 'you know i think we have a structural problem here' and they treat it like a pr crisis rather than like a business problem,' mcnamee said.\n\nin a new year's pledge, zuckerberg admitted facebook has a lot of work to do this year. he vowed to take action against offensive content and false news articles that could reach the site's more than two billion monthly active users.\n\nbut it's not just political ads that mcnamee was seeing that concerned him.\n\ni also saw people scraping facebook about black lives matter and selling it to police departments, i saw financial institutions using facebook tools to discriminate in housing. it was a wide range of things. basically, facebook created tools for engagement and in order to get people engaged they used things that effectively addicted them, mcnamee said.\n\nhe also believes users lost the power to discern what they were seeing.\n\npeople get trapped in this place where they think everyone agrees with them because facebook only shows you stuff you think you want, he said.\n\npart of what fuels that addiction, mcnamee said, is content that appeals to people's fear and anger, because that's what motivates and engages users.\n\nyou need to fix the product. you need to change the way the algorithms work. you need to change the business model, he said.\n\nin a statement to cbs news, a facebook spokesperson said: we've made major progress in combatting false news, fighting harassment, bringing more transparency to advertising and stopping bad actors from meddling in foreign elections. we know we have more to do and we will put our heads down and do the work.

generation, this is the day, the game, the season, and the team we've dreamed of. the 2017-18 philadelphia eagles are super bowl champions, and they've brought tremendous joy to hundreds of thousands throughout the city and region. they consistently wowed us with their dynamic play and relentless pursuit of victory. their next man up mentality when injuries arose was inspiring to anyone who has ever faced a setback, as was their willingness to embrace the role of underdogs. they looked another storied football franchise in the eyes, and never blinked. so to every member of the eagles, from owners jeff and tina lurie, and christina weiss lurie, to howie roseman and the entire front office staff, to doug pederson and his coaches, and to the players who won our hearts with their resilient and exciting play: thank you. you are champions, and your accomplishments will forever be part of the rich history of philadelphia sports. to the fans: i have long felt that our city's professional and collegiate sports teams bring philadelphians together, regardless of race, income, neighborhood or gender, and that was never more true than during the eagles' brilliant season. we know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your birds as champs. i urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers. go forth and

sacramento, calif. - the announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts pacific gas & electric co.'s problems squarely in the hands of gov. gavin newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink california's energy picture in the face of climate change.\n\nthis issue is all about three fundamental things: it is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, newsom told reporters monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.\n\nearlier in the day, pg&e announced it will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic california wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. the announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.\n\nwe'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. i respect the taxpayer, i respect the ratepayer and i'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.\n\nthe filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. it would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. that could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.\n\nthe chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state sen. bill dodd, a napa democrat.\n\nhow much and what the state can do remains to be seen. lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened pg&e bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. democratic assemblyman chris holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on monday he said he has backed off that idea.\n\nclearly pg&e has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about pg&e's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.\n\nin a tuesday morning note, height securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for pg&e's complex problems. as of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.\n\nclimate change makes matters worse\n\n\n\npg&e serves about 40 percent of california's utility customers, newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. it operates in three-quarters of california's land most vulnerable to wildfires, newsom said. while pg&e's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending california's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.\n\nstate officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in california history, a november blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.\n\nnewsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. but no one has yet figured out the future of california energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.\n\ndemocratic sen. jerry hill said a pg&e bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. hill represents san bruno in the san francisco bay area, where a pg&e natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.\n\nthis company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. i don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.\n\nonly viable option\n\n\n\nnewsom agreed pg&e hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. he noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including chief executive geisha williams, who resigned on sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.\n\nchapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, richard kelly, chairman of pg&e's board of directors, said in a statement.\n\nthe chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.\n\nregardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, pg&e customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.\n\nthe natural resources defense council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for pg&e's clean energy initiatives, which are key to california's environmental goals. pg&e is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the nrdc's ralph cavanagh.\n\nthe bankruptcy is different from pg&e's bankruptcy in 2001, when california faced an energy crisis that caused power outages. newsom said the state has an abundance of energy and power shutoffs are not imminent.

this month, workers put the finishing touches on the museum of the american revolution. it took them eight hours to hang a painting of george washington at the end of the war, and it's taken more than a decade to get to this point.\n\nin 2012, collections director for the museum scott stephenson gave cbs this morning: saturday co-host anthony mason a preview of some of the items that will go on display.\n\nsome of the historic items include a musket used in the battles of lexington and concord -- the first action in the war of independence -- and a soldier's canteen inscribed with the word ustates, one of only three known to have survived.\n\nstephenson, now the vice president of collections, exhibitions and programming, said, if you think about it, at this point the united states is still just an idea.\n\nfor years, the 3,000 items in this collection have been looking for a permanent home. this week, they'll finally have one in what will be the first national museum to tell the entire story of the american revolution.\n\nit's been a long time coming but i'm glad it's here, said brown university professor gordon wood.\n\nwood, a scholar of the revolution, said, there have been museums for almost every conceivable event in american history or person in american history. but not the american revolution. which is extraordinary when you think of the revolution as the most important event in our history.\n\nthe museum's collection will include a letter, written in washington's own hand, celebrating the french joining the cause. the original enlistment form for recruits to an uprising printed in the spring of 1775 will also be featured, according to stephenson.\n\na portion of the document reads, and enlist ourselves as soldiers in the massachusetts service for the preservation of the liberties of america. the beginning of the army.\n\ncbs news\n\nthe carvings on a soldier's powder horn show that the stakes were high, with phrases like kill or be killed and liberty or death.\n\nthe museum will also feature the faces of the revolution -- pictures taken of revolutionary war veterans during the earliest days of photography. some of these former soldiers were more than 100 years old when they posed for these pictures.\n\na 20-foot piece of canvas was general washington's home during the war.\n\ncbs news\n\npersonally, i think it's chilling to think about the emotions that were felt underneath this canvas, stephenson said.\n\nnow, out of storage, the tent is once again set up -- this time not on the fields of valley forge, but behind a layer of thick protective glass.\n\nto be an american is not to be somebody, but to believe in something. and the things we believe in came out of that revolution, wood said.\n\nwashington's victories led to the birth of a nation, and that story is written in this collection -- artifacts of an act of defiance that would literally change the world.
robots aren't replacing everyone, but a quarter of u.s. jobs will be severely disrupted as artificial intelligence accelerates the automation of existing work, according to a new brookings institution report.\n\nthe report, published thursday, says roughly 36 million americans hold jobs with high exposure to automation - meaning at least 70 percent of their tasks could soon be performed by machines using current technology. among those most likely to be affected are cooks, waiters and others in food services; short-haul truck drivers; and clerical office workers.\n\nthat population is going to need to upskill, reskill or change jobs fast, said mark muro, a senior fellow at brookings and lead author of the report.\n\nmuro said the timeline for the changes could be a few years or it could be two decades. but it's likely that automation will happen more swiftly during the next economic downturn. businesses are typically eager to implement cost-cutting technology as they lay off workers.\n\nsome economic studies have found similar shifts toward automating production happened in the early part of previous recessions - and may have contributed to the jobless recovery that followed the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nbut with new advances in artificial intelligence, it's not just industrial and warehouse robots that will alter the american workforce. self-checkout kiosks and computerized hotel concierges will do their part.\n\nmost jobs will change somewhat as machines take over routine tasks, but a majority of u.s. workers will be able to adapt to that shift without being displaced.\n\nthe changes will hit hardest in smaller cities, especially those in the heartland and rust belt and in states like indiana and kentucky, according to the report by the washington think tank. they will also disproportionately affect the younger workers who dominate food services and other industries at highest risk for automation.\n\nsome chain restaurants have already shifted to self-ordering machines; a handful have experimented with robot-assisted kitchens .\n\ngoogle this year is piloting the use of its digital voice assistant at hotel lobbies to instantly interpret conversations across a few dozen languages. autonomous vehicles could replace short-haul delivery drivers. walmart and other retailers are preparing to open cashier-less stores powered by in-store sensors or cameras with facial recognition technology.\n\nrestaurants will be able to get along with significantly reduced workforces, muro said. in the hotel industry, instead of five people manning a desk to greet people, there's one and people basically serve themselves.\n\nmany economists find that automation has an overall positive effect on the labor market, said matias cortes, an assistant professor at york university in toronto who was not involved with the brookings report. it can create economic growth, reduce prices and increase demand while also creating new jobs that make up for those that disappear.\n\nbut cortes said there's no doubt there are clear winners and losers. in the recent past, those hardest hit were men with low levels of education who dominated manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs, and women with intermediate levels of education who dominated clerical and administrative positions.\n\nin the future, the class of workers affected by automation could grow as machines become more intelligent. the brookings report analyzed each occupation's automation potential based on research by the mckinsey management consulting firm. those jobs that remain largely unscathed will be those requiring not just advanced education, but also interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.\n\nthese high-paying jobs require a lot of creativity and problem-solving, cortes said. that's going to be difficult for new technologies to replace.
new york -- for all its six seasons, downton abbey has been a graciously paced time-scape through early 1900s britain.\n\nhome base, of course, was the grand estate that lent the series its name. there the aristocratic crawley family and their household servants felt the world changing -- however incrementally -- under their feet.\n\nspanning from 1912 to the dawn of 1926, downton abbey was always about change. the old versus the new. time-honored values accosted by modernity. social graces under fire.\n\nwhat to make of the encroachment of a telephone, or the very idea of a lady out pursuing a career! the changes navigated by the downton denizens provided us viewers, a century removed, with the opportunity to measure ourselves against them as we, too, cope with change that alternately gladdens and confounds us. and as we, too, cut ties with the past.\n\nnow it takes nothing away from this glorious series to recognize that change, and a resistance to changing, has paved the way for the show's impending end.\n\nthe world is a different place from the way it was, my lord, says the butler, carson (jim carter), to his boss robert crawley, the earl of grantham (hugh bonneville). then, with stiff-upper-lip resolve, he adds, downton abbey must change with it.\n\nnot so with downton abbey the tv series, which gloried in staying put.\n\nairing sunday at 9 p.m. est on pbs' masterpiece, the conclusion is tender, upbeat and mostly satisfying, with no loose ends, nothing left to doubt, nothing likely to ignite water-cooler debate come monday morning. this is no head-scratching finale as with lost or the sopranos.\n\nof course not. throughout its run, downton always knew what it was, as did its audience, which loved it for its steadfast clarity and sense of purpose.\n\nit was steadfast with savory writing by series creator julian fellowes, who authored every script, and with its splendid cast and lush production values.\n\nit was steadfast, too, in its posh confinement to downton abbey, where, even as change gradually imposed itself, the narrative refused to change, and -- let's face it -- eventually began to feel repetitive. even at that sprawling country estate (with occasional excursions to london) there was only so much fresh story to tell.\n\nasked a couple of years ago how long the series might run, executive producer gareth neame cited a familiar principle of drama in replying, there are only seven stories, and i think the challenge with a long-running tv show is to retell those seven stories without anyone noticing. but there could come a time where we'll be going, 'what do we do now?'\n\ndownton abbey may well have reached a what-do-we-do-now point in its told-and-retold cycle of ailments, heartache, duplicity and politesse, plus withering commentary from the dowager countess, as played by maggie smith (who in the finale weighs in on what makes the english the way they are by observing tartly, some say our history. but i blame the weather).\n\nthe show, in short, was proudly tradition-bound, and prevailed to the end as a tv tradition for the faithful fans who watched it every week and, during each offseason, eagerly sought its return.\n\nbonneville has said the series is about family -- both the literal family and the staff as family. it explores the minutiae of those social structures, the nuances of the system as to whether someone's in or out.\n\nwe saw ourselves in them all -- in or out, elite or commoner, 1-percenters or the 99 percent. we were constantly reminded that now, as way back then, change is willing to spare no one. everyone feels the hot breath of progress.\n\nnow we are left on our own to face today's version of progress, a world of upheaval from which we found weekly refuge on downton. and after sunday we can ponder the parting words from cora, countess of grantham (elizabeth mcgovern) as expressed to her husband: i think the more adaptable we are, the more chance we have of getting through.\n\npart of our delight from downton was following the struggle of getting through as waged by those who seemed to have it all. we feasted on how the 1-percenters of that day kept up appearances, however much they seemed to be living on borrowed time.\n\ndownton abbey is smart to bring its saga to a close before it lets more time pass. it has gotten through in magnificent fashion, albeit more and more predictably. now it's adapting to obligatory change on its own classy terms: by saying goodbye.
the $600 stimulus checks that are going out to millions of people can now be individually tracked through the irs' get my payment website, which reopened on monday afternoon. the site informs people about the date of their payment and whether they will receive it via direct deposit or the mailed payment date.\n\nstill, there are some glitches that are delaying the payments of the stimulus money and creating confusion and questions for consumers. chief among them: some people who had their 2020 tax returns filed through tax preparers like h&r block may have had their stimulus check sent directly to the tax firm, rather than their bank account.\n\nthis echoes a glitch that impacted payment of the first stimulus check for some people who used tax prep services and for whom the irs didn't have direct-deposit information. with the second round of stimulus checks, a similar issue may impact some people, with h&r block warning its customers who used a service called a refund transfer that they might see an account number you don't recognize on the get my payment website. refund transfers are offered to allow people to tap their refund to pay their tax prep fees, according to h&r block.\n\nas many as 13 million people may experience a delay in receiving their money after the irs sent the funds to closed or invalid bank accounts, according to tax-prep company jackson hewitt.\n\nthe irs get my payment website may display an account number you don't recognize. if you took a refund transfer, it may be reflecting that account number. check your 2019 return to confirm. — h&r block (@hrblock) january 5, 2021\n\nh&r block, turbotax problems\n\nintuit's turbotax on tuesday also tweeted that some customers were having problems receiving their stimulus checks. the irs announced yesterday that due to the speed at which they issued this second round of payments, they sent some payments to an account that may be closed or no longer active, the tax-prep service said.\n\nthe irs said checks sent to closed or inactive accounts can't by law be held by the financial institutions and redirected to consumers. instead the funds will be returned to the irs, and people who didn't receive a check must wait until they file their 2020 tax returns to get the stimulus money in a refund. because of that, it's likely that those customers will face a delay.\n\nsome customers responded on social media that they had panicked after failing to receive their funds as expected, with some expressing concern they had been a victim of fraud.\n\nmeanwhile, the irs said on monday that the direct deposits could take several days to post to individual accounts after the official payment day of january 4. it added that some people may see their stimulus checks listed as pending or as provisional payments in their accounts.\n\nhere's what to know about tracking your payment.\n\nhow can i get my stimulus check?\n\nthe irs says people will automatically get their payments in the second round of stimulus checks. one way to track the status of your payment is to visit the get my payment site.\n\nas with the first round, you will need to enter a few pieces of personally identifiable information, such as your social security number, date of birth and address. the site will then provide you with the status of both your first and second stimulus payments.\n\nwhat will get my payment tell me?\n\nthe get my payment site will inform you about the date of the payment and the method, which the irs says will either be the mailed payment date or the date of direct deposit to your bank account. checks sent in the mail will need more processing and mailing time, although the irs didn't specify the length of time that will be needed.\n\nthe irs says it is prioritizing direct deposit payments to people with valid routing and account information.\n\ncan i change my bank account information?\n\nthe irs says that option isn't available this time around because the tax agency is issuing the checks based on information it already has on file from the first round of checks. in the first round of checks directed by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (or cares act), people could enter or correct their bank account information at the get my payment site.\n\nhowever, that's not an option in the second round. you will not be able to add new routing or account information and cannot request to receive your payment by eip card, the irs said on december 30.\n\nwhat if the irs sent the check to a closed account?\n\nbecause people can't update their bank account information on the get my payment site, there's concern that some checks might be sent to accounts that were recently closed. if that's the case, the irs says you'll have to wait until you file your 2020 tax returns.\n\nthe stimulus checks are actually a tax rebate that can be applied to your annual tax returns — but that means people may be waiting weeks or even months for their stimulus money to show up through their tax refund.\n\nwhy is it saying payment not available?\n\nthis was a message that frustrated many consumers in the first round of checks, and resulted from a number of issues, such as if the irs was still verifying whether a person qualified for a check.\n\nsome people are receiving this message with the second round of stimulus checks, which the irs says either means the person doesn't qualify for a check — such as if their income exceeds the eligibility threshold — or the irs says it was unable to issue you an eip 2 payment, which is the irs' term for the second stimulus check.\n\nthe irs said that it might not be able to issue a second stimulus payment if it is still processing your most recent tax return.\n\nwhat if i receive social security through the direct express debit card?\n\nthe irs says that people who receive government benefits such as social security, railroad retirement benefits, supplemental security income or veteran's benefits through direct express — a debit card that automatically receives payments — will get their second stimulus checks deposited onto that card.\n\nbut the irs cautioned, the bank information shown in get my payment will be a number associated with your direct express card and may be a number you don't recognize.
lansing, mich. --- larry nassar, the sports doctor accused of sexually assaulting more than 150 women and girls, will be confronted again this week by scores of victims as he faces another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts, this time at an elite michigan club run by an olympic coach. judge janice cunningham has set aside three days for roughly 60 people who want to confront nassar or have their statement read in court.\n\nthe event could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county that ended with nassar getting sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. the judge in that case described it as signing the doctor's death warrant.\n\ninaction is an action. silence is indifference. justice requires action and a voice -- and that is what has happened here in this court, judge rosemarie aquilina said last week before announcing the sentence. she said it was her honor and privilege to sentence nassar.\n\nthe practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. but attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal, especially since nassar pleaded guilty, agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of his deal with prosecutors.\n\nif you get what you bargained for, then you really can't argue that you were prejudiced in any way, said margaret raben, former leader of a michigan association of criminal defense attorneys.\n\nit's not uncommon for prosecutors to introduce aggravating evidence at sentencing to support their request for a severe punishment. but the parade of victims offering emotional accounts of their abuse to the face of an abuser went well beyond the typical hearing.\n\nraben said there was a horrible dynamic last week in judge rosemarie aquilina's courtroom, even if the judge had the option to allow so many people to speak in a case that involved just seven victims.\n\nher obvious delight was just off the wall, raben said, referring to aquilina's death warrant remark and others. i am not defending larry nassar at all, but what i saw with her was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor. ... the process doesn't change because everybody hates the defendant. that is the absolute glory, or should be, of the american justice system.\n\na fellow ingham county judge, william collette, said aquilina's handling of the hearing was outrageous. others, however, have praised her treatment of victims and their parents.\n\nthe case on cunningham's docket wednesday in eaton county centers on nassar's assaults at twistars, a lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 olympic coach john geddert. nassar admits penetrating three girls with his hands when he was supposed to be treating them for injuries.\n\nso far, 57 victims want to speak in court or submit statements. attorney mick grewal said 11 of his clients have signed up, including some who were inspired by the 150-plus young women and girls who appeared in aquilina's court. he called it a cathartic experience.\n\nnow they're at a point in their healing process where they want to confront larry, and they want to show the world that they are survivors and they are strong and they are part of this movement, grewal said. it helps them through the healing process.\n\nhe said the nassar cases are extraordinary in the number of victims who have come forward.\n\nthe only case that's out there that's even similar in stature is penn state, and this is now six times as big as penn state, maybe seven times, grewal said, referring to boys who said they were sexually abused by assistant football coach jerry sandusky.\n\nthe last witness to speak at nassar's sentencing hearing last week was rachael denhollander, a kentucky lawyer and one of the first women to publicly identify herself as one of nassar's young victims. denhollander contacted michigan state university police in 2016 after reading reports about how usa gymnastics, which trains olympians, mishandled complaints of sexual misconduct. nassar worked at michigan state and also was the national gymnastics squad's doctor.\n\ndenhollander said nassar groped, fondled and penetrated her with his hands when she was a 15-year-old gymnast in michigan.\n\nlarry, i can call what you did evil and wicked because it was, denhollander said wednesday.\n\nyou have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires, she said.\n\nthe nassar scandal has continued to trigger developments across the country, from texas to the nation's capital. texas gov. greg abbott ordered a criminal investigation tuesday after victims said they were assaulted by nassar at the karolyi ranch, a famous texas facility that was the training ground for u.s. women's gymnastics. the ranch is owned by former national team coordinators bela and martha karolyi.\n\nusa gymnastics cut ties with the ranch earlier this month, a few days after olympic champion simone biles said she dreaded the thought of having to return there to train.\n\nit is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as i work towards my dream of competing in tokyo 2020, i will have to continually return to the same training facility where i was abused, biles said in a statement.\n\nin michigan, former gov. john engler was expected to become interim president at michigan state, according to a high-ranking school official involved in the plan. the official told the associated press that trustees would vote wednesday to hire engler. the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been publicly announced. the school's top post is vacant after lou anna simon resigned last week.\n\nengler will head the school as it confronts lawsuits filed by more than 100 women and girls, and investigations by the state attorney general, the ncaa and congress.\n\nin washington, the senate considered a bill that would require governing bodies for amateur athletics to quickly report claims of abuse to law enforcement.
moonlight is a coming-of-age movie that's come in for a lot of critical acclaim, not to mention a bundle of oscar nominations.\n\nso, will they call out its name after they ask for the envelope please? here's nancy giles:\n\na timid boy named chiron is having a tough time growing up in liberty city, one of miami's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nkevin: you funny, man.\n\nchiron: why you say that?\n\nkevin: you just is, that's all.\n\nthe other kids taunt chiron because he's different.\n\npaula: you ever see the way he walk, juan?\n\njuan: you watch your damn mouth.\n\npaula: you gonna tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time, huh?\n\nhis single mom is a crack addict, his surrogate parents the local drug dealer and his girlfriend.\n\nmoonlight is one of the season's most-talked-about films. it won the golden globe for best picture-drama, and it was just nominated for eight academy awards, including best picture. not bad for an independent film made in just 25 days for less than $5 million.\n\nin addition to best picture, barry jenkins has two more oscar nominations for moonlight: best director and best adapted screenplay.\n\ngiles asked jenkins, have people noticed, by the way, that there are no white characters in the movie?\n\npeople have noticed, yeah, he replied. you know, it wasn't a conscious decision, but, you know, i didn't know any white people who weren't teachers until i was, like, a freshman in college. and i walked in and my roommate was white. i didn't have any white friends. there were just no white people around. and we tried to have fidelity to the world the characters live in.\n\nmoonlight, director barry jenkins' evocative tale of a young man's coming-of-age. david bornfriend/a24\n\njenkins and playwright tarell alvin mccraney both grew up in liberty city; they know the neighborhood where the film takes place. they both attended the same elementary school, at different times.\n\nmccraney wrote the original script upon which barry jenkins based moonlight. they lived a few blocks away from each other in liberty city, but didn't actually meet until they started working on the movie. while mccraney is gay and jenkins is straight, they say they put a lot of themselves into the story, such as a fight scene involving the central character.\n\nit happened in that space, mccraney said. and it was probably one of the most terrifying moments for me, 'cause it was always -- you just never knew what was gonna happen.\n\nso lunch time could be a really terrifying time for you? giles asked.\n\nyeah, lunch time was never a time for eating.\n\nmccraney, a macarthur genius grant recipient, and jenkins share a terrible coincidence: both of their mothers were crack users, and both became hiv positive as a result.\n\ni do know that there was a deep pain that she was trying to hide, that she was trying to alleviate, mccraney said.\n\nbritish actress naomie harris has portrayed a sea goddess in pirates of the caribbean and winnie mandela, among other roles. to play chiron's mom (for which she's received a best supporting actress oscar nomination), harris watched youtube interviews with crack users, and met with a woman who struggled with addiction.\n\ni couldn't understand this concept, harris said. we know how destructive drugs are. so how does somebody get attracted to that, you know? and she has a son. and so i had so much judgment, actually, and i really had to work very hard to overcome that judgment.\n\nwhat you do as an actor is you're inhabiting souls. and you're asking those souls to come into your space. and you could only do that in a non-judgmental way.\n\nchiron is actually portrayed at three ages by three different actors. but to play little chiron, 12-year-old alex hibbert didn't do the preparation that the other, more experienced performers did.\n\nhow did he do it? i don't know, he said. i don't know. i just went with what they told me to do, and then i just got into the character that they told me to be, and just went on from there.\n\nhibbert, also from miami near liberty city, had acted in school plays, but never in a movie.\n\nmahershala ali said, alex is the best scene partner that i've ever had. i say that sincerely. he's so wise for his age. he was such a professional, but he's also a kid.\n\nali, whom you may recognize from hidden figures and house of cards, plays the hibbert's character's father figure.\n\nwhat i learned in working with him was to try to do less and work to not act, ali said. and that's an important reminder for someone like myself who's been very fortunate to be working for a couple of decades now.\n\ngiles asked hibbert, how does that make you feel?\n\namazing, because same to him, he replied.\n\nali (now a best supporting actor oscar nominee) shares two memorable scenes with hibbert: one in which chiron learns to swim.\n\njenkins explained, what's happening is alex hibbert, our non-actor, actually does not know how to swim. and mahershala is actually teaching him how to swim as this storm is coming in off the coast.\n\nand there's another scene, in which chiron learns who he is.\n\nchiron: what's a faggot?\n\njuan: a faggot is ... a word used to make gay people feel bad.\n\nchiron: am i a faggot?\n\njuan: no. no. you could be gay, but don't let anybody call you no faggot.\n\nchron: how do i know?\n\njuan: you just do.\n\ngiles asked, when you typed the word 'faggot' for the first time, and you saw it on the page, what did you think?\n\nbomb! jenkins laughed. i thought it was a bomb. yeah, it was scary.\n\nhibbert added, at first i was watching to see if my mom was there, 'cause my mom is very strict and she doesn't like me saying 'words.'\n\nali said of filming that scene, it felt sacred that day, it really did. i felt like we made a little bit of magic that day.\n\nmoonlight is far from a blockbuster; it's made just $16 million so far. but its eight oscar nods and critical acclaim may help the movie reach a larger audience.\n\nit's an opportunity for us to learn about people who haven't had an opportunity to speak for themselves, ali said.\n\njenkins said, i think it's really important to remind, reinforce people that their lives have value, you know? that their lives have worth.\n\nharris added, it bypasses the mind and it speaks straight to your heart, and also it shows just how, like, we all on some level are damaged. and we are all coming from this wounded place in our search for connection and love. and i think just seeing that really helps people understand their journey and helps people understand each other. and i think now, more than ever, we need that reminder.\n\ngiles asked hibbert, how are your friends reacting to all of this?\n\noh, they're all, like, 'alex, you're a big movie star now. slide me some change!' he laughed.\n\nand what do you do when they say, 'slide me some change'?\n\ni be, like, 'i got you,' but … hibbert laughed.\n\n\n\nfor more info:
she's best remembered for her iconic tv roles, but mary tyler moore also found success -- and some setbacks -- on broadway and in the movies.\n\nwhen moore jumped from the small to the big screen, she stepped into new roles -- and a new image far from the sweetheart mary, revealing something her fans had never seen before.\n\nin flirting with disaster, she plays a crazy mom … and she's wonderful, exclaimed david edelstein, a movie critic for cbs sunday morning and new york magazine.\n\nin terms of movies, how will mary tyler moore be remembered? cbs news correspondent peter vant sant asked edelstein.\n\nas a cautionary tale, he remarked.\n\ncautionary, edelstein says, because mary tyler moore struggled on the big screen.\n\nshe just wasn't comfortable with that kind of acting, he explained. the elvis movie 'change of habit' really sank her movie career. … elvis, you know, in the ghetto with a nun played by mary tyler moore was just too much.\n\none notable exception was moore's oscar-nominated role in the critically acclaimed 1980 movie, ordinary people, where she left her cheerful laura petrie character lying on the kitchen floor.\n\nby not doing what she usually did, she was able to give an extraordinary performance, said edelstein.\n\nit's a performance she talked about with charlie rose in 1995:\n\nmary tyler moore: i came through that thinking that i was playing my father … and was shortly thereafter to realize that i was playing myself.\n\ncharlie rose: which part?\n\nmary tyler moore: expectations, perfectionism, loath to communicate any failings.\n\nin 'ordinary people,' you know, she dug pretty deep in herself, i think, for that character. but she should have won an oscar for it, said actor dick van dyke.\n\nthroughout her long acting career, moore produced and starred in plays, including sweet sue. she won a tony award for a role as a quadriplegic in the play, whose life is it anyway?\n\nin 2012, moore was honored for her remarkable body of work.\n\nshe did win the screen actors guild lifetime achievement award, which includes big screen and small screen right? van sant asked edelstein.\n\nthe screen actor's guild was not for the big screen, trust me, edelstein replied. it was for laura petrie and it was for mary richards. …anyone who, in this lifetime, gives us a character like laura petrie and mary richards, can really die happy, you know?
new york governor andrew cuomo said tuesday a new covid-19 strain that was detected in the state after it was first identified in the united kingdom last month could be a game changer. he called it highly problematic.\n\nthis is a virus we have to be extra careful with, the governor said at a press conference.\n\nthe state's first confirmed diagnosis of the contagious new strain was detected in saratoga springs. the man who tested positive is affiliated with a jewelry store there, cbs new york reported. the person had no known travel history, cuomo said.\n\nthe governor urged anyone who was exposed, or who was exposed to someone who was exposed, to contact state officials. there's nothing to be ashamed of, he said. this is a virus that travels. but we have to know. containment is vitally important here.\n\nexperts say there's no evidence the new strain is resistant to the vaccines and the infections are no more severe. but the governor said this week since it is more transmissible it could lead to more cases and more hospitalizations.\n\neven if the lethality doesn't go up, the fact that it is so much more transmittable is a very real problem, he said.\n\napparently the u.k. strain can actually overtake the original covid strain in a matter of weeks, he said tuesday. that's how quickly it can transmit.\n\nit dramatically increases our challenge and we have to be aware of it, he said.\n\nin late december, colorado became the first state to confirm a case of the variant, in a man in his 20s with no travel history. southern california reported a case soon after in a 30-year-old man with no travel history, and public health officials in florida said they had also discovered evidence of a case in a man in his 20s with no travel history.
democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg says he would pay more to uncle sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans. what the former new york city mayor hasn't said: he'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.\n\nbloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. that includes him: bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to forbes.\n\nmuch of that fortune is tied to bloomberg llc, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. the candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant douglas taylor. and his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.\n\nbloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. but that's not unique. all of the major democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nwhat's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. for instance, bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before president donald trump and congressional republicans lowered it in late 2017. (rivals like pete buttigieg, sanders and warren would like to roll back mr. trump's corporate tax cut completely.) that 2017 corporate-rate change saved bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.\n\nbloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates.\n\nwe don't have nor discuss mike's personal financials, a bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released.\n\nthe bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other democratic candidates have proposed, including sanders and warren as well as joe biden, pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar.\n\nbloomberg plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.\n\nhow it would work: a key in understanding bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. that means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.\n\nbloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the irs to put in place, said janet holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the urban-brookings tax policy center. but it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.\n\ncurrently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. he calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.\n\nbloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under president barack obama. that would bring the highest income tax rate under bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. that's still less than sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.\n\nhow many people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge: income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. but that might not be true for bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.\n\nroughly 11,000 americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the social security administration. include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.\n\nas of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. so the number is likely somewhere between those two.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. but that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.\n\nbased on earned income alone, bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the university of pennsylvania's penn wharton budget model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that bloomberg is proposing). about $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.\n\nsanders plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.\n\nhow it would work: sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. after that, it gets complicated.\n\nsanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.\n\nthe advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. for instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.\n\nthe disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. that wouldn't be cheap. and many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of their wealth overseas.\n\nhow many people would pay the wealth tax: the sanders wealth tax would likely affect more americans than those who would pay bloomberg's surcharge. the sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest american families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman. that's about 40,000 more households than bloomberg's wealth tax.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: the sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. penn wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.\n\nwarren plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.\n\nhow it would work: warren's plan, like sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. but her blueprint is simpler.\n\nthere are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. billionaires would pay 6%. that should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as bloomberg proposes.\n\nhow many people would pay: the warren campaign, as well as economists saez and zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. but another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money warren says it could.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: saez and zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. penn wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.\n\nbiden, buttigieg and klobuchar\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.\n\nhow their plans would work: neither joe biden, pete buttigieg nor amy klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. of the three, only klobuchar has said she is open to one. buttigieg called warren's wealth tax extreme.\n\nin fact, biden and buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.\n\ninstead, and like bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. that would hit the rich more than average americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, iras and other pre-tax retirement plans.\n\nthe candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before president trump took office. that would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.\n\nhow many people would pay more tax: the biden, buttigieg and klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all americans, not just the super wealthy.\n\nas of 2017, some 1.4 million american households had annual income of more than $500,000. nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.\n\nhow much government revenue they would raise: penn wharton has said biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. but that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. about half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to penn wharton's calculations.\n\nthe buttigieg and klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. neither campaign responded to comment for this article.\n\neditor's note: cbs moneywatch senior reporter stephen gandel is a former employee of bloomberg llc.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story said that candidate mike bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. in fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%.
a condition that doctors used to only see in factory workers is becoming more widespread.\n\nthe pain that comes from the repetitive movements of texting has been dubbed smartphone thumb by doctors.\n\nit's actually tendinitis, when the tendon that bends and flexes the thumb becomes inflamed. more and more people are complaining about this type of pain in their thumb each year, say doctors at the mayo clinic.\n\nmy phone is a huge part of my life, scott seehusen told cbs minnesota recently as he sat alone with his smartphone at a picnic table by lake calhoun, in minneapolis.\n\ni do everything from texting to emails, social media. everything, he said.\n\ndr. kristin zhao, a biomedical engineer at the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota, explained what might be happening inside the hand to cause smartphone thumb.\n\none of the hypotheses is that the joints get loose and lax, and because of that, the bones kind of move differently than they would in a normal situation, said zhao.\n\nzhao and a team of colleagues have been studying smartphone thumb for the last seven years. she says the movements we require our thumbs to make as we hold our phones are awkward.\n\nit's also a movement that requires some force through the thumbs. so when you press on your phone, you know, you're interacting with your phone. it's not just free movement in space, she said.\n\nmayo clinic researchers began using a dynamic imaging technique in 2010 to watch the bones of a healthy patient move so they could document what's normal and compare it with what's not.\n\nour hypothesis is that abnormal motion of bones in the thumb could be causing pain onset and eventual osteoarthritis, zhao said.\n\ncould too much texting lead to more cases of arthritis in the thumb? zhao says maybe.\n\nthere is a high incidence of osteoarthritis in the thumb, and we just want to make sure we aren't encouraging that onset by our daily activities, she said.\n\nanother concern the researchers want to address is the impact of so much thumb movement on children. what it will mean for them later in life is unknown.\n\nwe really don't understand why adults get pain, and so children, if you start earlier, you may get pain younger, she said.\n\nto prevent problems, start by giving your thumbs a break, doctors say. mix up your method by using your forefinger to peck the screen, or use your voice to dictate a message.\n\nyou can also perform daily stretching exercises with your wrists and fingers to keep your tendons limber.\n\nthink about wow often you're using your joints and how often you are resting them, advises zhao.\n\nare we taking periodic rests, or are we just exposing continually over the course of the day? she asked.\n\nit could be a tough habit to break, though.\n\nfrequent texter samantha alsadi, who was walking her dog and using her phone at the same lake where cbs minnesota found seehusen, said, i don't know if it will change people's, like, habits or addiction to their phone, but it's nice to know that we're already thinking ahead about that.\n\nthe mayo clinic study is ongoing, and researchers have not yet reached any conclusions. but what doctors do already know about osteoarthritis in the thumb is that it occurs more in women than men.
reverb is a new documentary series from cbsn originals. watch the latest episode, rising tide: priced out in miami, in the video player above.\n\nalba hernandez lives in one of miami's few affordable pockets. she's owned her mobile home in the city's little river neighborhood since 2003. when she moved in, rent for the patch of land under her house was $245 a month — below what she'd pay for an equivalent apartment in the city.\n\nhernandez was used to the less-than-$20-a-month increases she would get every year. but two years ago, she got a rude surprise. the trailer park had a new owner who wanted to hike hernandez's rent to $700 — a nearly 50% increase.\n\ni can't find the money at this moment. that is impossible for me in this moment, said hernandez, who lives on a fixed income and says medical issues prevent her from working.\n\nalba hernandez at her home in miami. cbs news\n\nhernandez and many of her neighbors in the community of 800 are fighting the hike in court. the new owner, miami soar management corp., responded by sending more than 100 eviction notices. the case is ongoing, and hernandez said the stress from the twice-a-week letters from the landowners exacerbates her health issues.\n\nthey don't like us. they don't worry about us. they want more money, she told cbs news.\n\nthe scenario is a common one in many low-income communities in increasingly pricey cities. but in low-lying miami, it's more than real estate speculation driving the new owners. it's also the fear of climate change.\n\nthe city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. the city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help. water is rising right through the ground, permeating the porous limestone on which much of miami sits. the sea walls other cities are considering won't work here.\n\nincreasingly, the wealthy residents living near miami's shores are looking at another option: move inland to higher ground, to historically less desirable neighborhoods populated by working-class people.\n\neven mobile home parks, because of where they are, are vulnerable to such gentrification.\n\nresidents of a mobile home community in miami's little river neighborhood are concerned about being pushed out. cbs news\n\nyou don't really find mobile home parks in miami beach. you find them more inland. and now as developers are looking inland for long-term development, these mobile home parks are vulnerable, said nejla calvo, an attorney representing hernandez and the 800 other residents of the soar mobile home park.\n\nin the last five years, greater miami has lost seven mobile-home parks, or about 700 housing units, calvo estimated. one of these parks is now home to magic city, a multimillion-dollar development that will eventually include 2,600 housing units. rents for those are not yet set.\n\nmobile home parks are one of the few affordable options in a country that's seen skyrocketing housing costs. in florida, 1 in 6 housing units is a mobile home, calvo told cbs news.\n\ndespite their name, most mobile homes are affixed to the ground and not readily moveable. so if a homeowner loses the land they've been renting, their options are to abandon the site and move in with relatives in miami or leave the city altogether, calvo said.\n\ni, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in miami that's developable, calvo said. these mobile home parks are located in areas that are more and more desirable, especially with climate change and with flooding and areas in highlands are more attractive to developers.\n\nthe park's owners don't disagree.\n\njust the dirt of the land itself is worth far more than the original owner could ever have imagined 50 years ago, said martin feldman, an attorney for miami soar management corp. you're talking about a million dollars of square foot property here.\n\nthe company plans to develop the plot in the next three to four years, building luxury housing along with up to 2,500 units of affordable housing, feldman said. he added that none of the mobile home residents would be forced to move if they didn't want to. he also denied that mobile home residents have been evicted, describing the eviction notices as a negotiating tactic.\n\nbut some residents of the park, unwilling to fight the rent hikes, have already left, calvo said. while about half of the 100 eviction attempts were dismissed, about 20 are still pending, she said.\n\nfor hernandez, whose only child lives in honduras, leaving isn't option, and neither is moving into her sister's already full house. they've looked for someplace else to live, but so far, they've had no luck.\n\nit's the same problem, she said. the money. the money is a problem in this country.
cia director gina haspel has named cynthia didi rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the directorate of analysis. rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.\n\ndidi rapp brings broad, deep expertise from across the agency and the intelligence community to her new role as the head of our directorate of analysis, said cia director of public affairs brittany bramell. with her engaging leadership style and reputation for objectivity, didi will excel in leading our talented analytic cadre.\n\nrapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at cia and headed up intelligence integration at the office of the director of national intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the president's daily brief (pdb). the third woman to hold the post since 2002, rapp succeeds longtime incumbent richard hoch, who will serve as chief strategy officer for the agency.\n\nas head of the directorate of analysis – which was once known as the directorate of intelligence – rapp will oversee the agency's efforts to synthesize intelligence from the cia's operations arm and other elements of the intelligence community, including open source data and satellite imagery. agency analysts take raw intelligence from abroad, offer regional expertise and put it into context. they interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the pdb.\n\nthe deputy director for analysis is one of the most important positions at cia, said michael morell, a former cia deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the da. morell is also a cbs news senior national security contributor.\n\nrapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former cia director john brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete mission centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security. under that structure, analysts and operations officers work side by side.\n\nanalytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like russia and china, to persistent proliferation concerns from north korea and iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said david priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the clinton and george w. bush administrations. the new dda will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa.\n\nrapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. a former clandestine operations officer who in may became the first female director of the cia, haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many cia veterans and insiders.\n\nthirty-four-year agency veteran beth kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in december. sonya holt, who likewise spent over three decades at cia, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in august, when similarly long-serving cia officials vaughn bishop, now deputy director, and andy makridis, now chief operating officer (coo), were also named.\n\nyou've got a director, deputy director and coo who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, priess said. this is also leadership at cia at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. this could have gone in a very different direction.\n\nhaspel's immediate predecessor, mike pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, brian bulatao, to serve as coo. brennan chose associates from within the treasury department and national security council to be his deputies.\n\nthough some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil.\n\nthe leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said ned price, a former cia analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the trump administration. they help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.\n\nnow is not the time to radically remake the agency, price, who is now a fellow at the new america foundation, said. there's enough going on outside its walls.\n\nalthough the cia and haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding president trump's decision to revoke brennan's security clearance last august; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, haspel's own involvement in the cia's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. in doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.\n\npompeo, during his year-long tenure as cia director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. he sent a letter to the harvard kennedy school announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name chelsea manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to wikileaks, a visiting fellow.\n\npompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to benjamin wittes, the editor-in-chief of lawfare, after wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card pompeo distributed to cia's workforce.\n\nfor her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the university of louisville, in september.\n\ni think director haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, morell said. in this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-trump or anti-trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.\n\nformer senior cia official carmen medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as deputy director of intelligence, agreed.\n\nwith this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'i's are dotted and 't's are crossed – it's a difficult time, medina said. you need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate.\n\nmedina also applauded haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.\n\nit's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. but i think she's very brave for appointing so many women, medina said of haspel's leadership choices.\n\nshe doesn't have to do that, and the fact that she is doing it is kind of awesome.
netflix boss reed hastings isn't happy with a recent rule change for the cannes film festival regarding distribution -- even though his streaming platform got a pass for this year, at least.\n\nafter fielding complaints from french exhibitors about the growing footprint of streaming studios like netflix and amazon, the prestigious festival's board decided to adapt its rules regarding french distribution.\n\nany film that wishes to compete in competition at cannes will have to commit itself to being distributed in french movie theaters, the board said in a statement, explaining that the new rule would go into effect for the 2018 festival.\n\nthe issue was raised by france's exhibitors' association, which disagreed with the festival including two netflix titles -- bong joon-ho's okja and noah baumbach's the meyerowitz stories -- that would go on to be released on the streaming platform.\n\ncannes is aware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in france. the festival de cannes asked netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of french movie theaters and not only its subscribers, the statement said. the festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\n\nhastings responded to the rule change with a pointed facebook post. the establishment closing ranks against us, he wrote wednesday. see 'okja' on netflix june 28th. amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into cannes film festival competition.\n\nas cannes' rules now stand, netflix will have to agree to strict french theatrical distribution deals in order to have its films included in the festival in 2018 and beyond.

indianapolis -- usa gymnastics says its entire board of directors will resign as requested by the u.s. olympic committee. the move came friday in the fallout from the larry nassar sexual abuse scandal.\n\nthe former usa gymnastics sports doctor pleaded guilty to molesting girls and young women. some of the nation's top gymnasts, including olympians aly raisman, mckayla maroney, simone biles and jordyn wieber, said they were among his victims.\n\nthe usoc had threatened to decertify the gymnastics organization, which besides picking u.s. national teams is the umbrella organization for hundreds of clubs across the country. a handful of board members had stepped down, but the usoc said a wholesale change was needed. the usoc has also demanded much tighter reporting from usa gymnastics on reforms it is making. it also required all usag staff and board members to complete various safety and ethics training courses over the next six months.\n\nnassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison wednesday -- the seventh day of a remarkable hearing that gave girls, young women and their parents a chance to confront nassar in court.\n\ni just signed your death warrant, judge rosemarie aquilina said as she sentenced nassar.\n\ni find that you don't get it -- that you're a danger. you remain a danger, she said.\n\naquilina said it was her honor and privilege to sentence nassar.\n\non friday, michigan state athletic director mark hollis announced his retirement in the wake of the nassar scandal. he was the second university official to step down this week amid sharp criticism over the school's handling of allegations against the former doctor.\n\nhollis, who had been in the job for 10 years, disclosed the move during a meeting with a small group of reporters on campus. he was asked why he would not stay on.\n\nbecause i care, hollis said, holding back tears. when you look at the scope of everything, that's the reason i made a choice to retire now. and i hope that has a little bit, a little bit, of helping that healing process.
on january 2, 2021, earth is closer to the sun in its elliptical orbit than on any other day of the year, marking an annual event known as perihelion.\n\nthe word perihelion is translated from ancient greek, meaning near the sun. according to earthsky, earth was expected to reach perihelion on saturday morning at 8:51 a.m. et.\n\nthe sun is about 3% larger in the sky on saturday — not enough to be noticeable with the naked eye. remember: you should never look at the sun without proper eye protection, and sunglasses are not a sufficient replacement for solar-viewing glasses.\n\nearth's orbit is not a perfect circle, meaning sometimes the planet is a bit closer to our star, and sometimes it is farther away. the distance varies by about 3 million miles over the course of the year — nearly 13 times the distance from earth to the moon.\n\nperihelion also marks the moment when the earth is moving at its fastest in its orbit around the sun. the planet is currently racing around the sun at almost 19 miles per second — about .6 miles per second farther than when it reaches its farthest point from the sun in july.\n\n✨ this new year comes with cosmic treats! in january, our planet will be at its closest point in orbit around the sun, known as perihelion. we'll also get a chance to see uranus near the moon and mars and spot a fast-moving mercury. 🔭 skywatching tips: https://t.co/htlepz1khx pic.twitter.com/bx3wdud7ue — nasa jpl (@nasajpl) december 31, 2020\n\nif you run east at local midnight, you will be moving about as fast as you can (at least in sun-centered coordinates) for your location, nasa said.\n\nbecause of this, summer in the northern hemisphere lasts about five days longer than winter, according to earthsky. the opposite is true in the southern hemisphere.\n\nalthough sunlight is more intense on saturday, winter in the northern hemisphere is unaffected, due to the 23.5-degree tilt of earth's axis. being closer to the sun does not change the earth's tilt, so the north pole is still tilted away from the sun.\n\nsix months from now, on july 5, earth will be at its farthest from the sun, known as its aphelion, meaning far from the sun. at perihelion, earth is about 91.5 million miles from the sun, and at aphelion, it is around 94.5 million miles away.\n\nbetween perihelion and aphelion, there is about a 6.7% difference in the intensity of the sunlight as it hits our planet. according to nasa, this is one explanation for more extreme seasons in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere.\n\nthe perihelion isn't the only celestial event this weekend. saturday night into sunday morning also marks the peak of the quadrantid meteor shower — one of the best of the year.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, February 10th. I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nBreaking news this morning as Virginia's embattled governor, Ralph Northam, sat down with Gayle King for CBS THIS MORNING. We'll have a preview.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM (CBS THIS MORNING/D-Virginia): Yes, I have thought about resigning, but-- but I've also thought about what Virginia needs right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle's interview comes as the scandals involving the top three state-elected officials in Virginia near meltdown proportions. Now Virginia Democrats are calling for Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to quit following accusations of sexual misconduct and now rape. As the governor, attorney general, and Republican leader in the State Senate struggle to deal with racially insensitive photos from their past, we'll talk with two Democrats from the Virginia congressional delegation, Jennifer Wexton and Don Beyer. Then, as the deadline nears for a deal to keep the government from shutting down again, what's the status of negotiations? We'll ask a key conservative in the House, North Carolina's Mark Meadows.\n\nAll of that, and more news of the week just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin with the chaos in Virginia's government and the scandals that have rocked the top three Democrats in the commonwealth, Governor Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring. CBS THIS MORNING co-host Gayle King has just returned from Richmond, Virginia, where she spoke to the governor in his only television interview.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nGAYLE KING (CBS THIS MORNING/CBS THIS MORNING Co-Host/@GayleKing): I know this has been a very difficult week for you in the state of Virginia. So where would you like to begin?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM (CBS THIS MORNING/D-Virginia/@GovernorVA): Well, it has been a difficult week. And-- and, you know, if you look at Virginia's history we're now at the four hundred year anniversary, just ninety miles from here in 1619 the first indentured servants from Africa landed on our shores in Old Point Comfort what we call now Fort Monroe and while--\n\nGAYLE KING: Also known as slavery.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah, yeah.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And, you know, while we have made a lot of progress in-- in Virginia, slavery has ended, schools have been desegregated. We have ended the Jim Crow laws, easier access to voting. It is abundantly clear that we still have a lot of work to do and I-- I really think this week raised a level of awareness in the Commonwealth and in this country--\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Mm.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --that we haven't seen certainly in my lifetime.\n\nGAYLE KING: And why you think you still deserve this job when so many people are calling for you to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again we-- we have worked very hard. We've had a good first year. And-- and I'm a leader. I've been in some very difficult situations, life and death situations taking care of sick children. And right now--\n\nGAYLE KING: Because you're a doctor, yes?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --right now, Virginia needs someone that can heal. There's no better person to do that than a doctor. Virginia also needs someone who is strong, who has empathy, who has courage and who has a moral compass. And that's why I'm not going anywhere. I have learned from this. I have a lot more to learn. But we're in a unique opportunity now. Again the four hundred year anniversary of-- of the history whether it be good or bad in Virginia to really make some impactful changes--\n\nGAYLE KING: Of slavery in this country?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: In this state, yeah. Did you ever think about resigning when the drumbeat became so loud and, by the way, there was still beating for you to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: I don't live in a vacuum.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so, yes, I-- I have heard it. And I've had-- this has been a difficult week. And again, I'm-- I'm fine. It's been mainly difficult for Virginia in this country. So, yes, I have thought about resigning but-- but I've also thought about what Virginia needs right now. And I-- I really think that I'm in a position where-- where I can take Virginia to the next level and it-- it will be very positive and, you know, we have a number of inequities in this country right now and in Virginia and-- and we're in a position to really stop talking so much and now to take action with policy to address a lot of these inequities.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, thank you for bringing us this interview. What did you make of the governor's explanation?\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, the interview was at seven o'clock, and he was there ready to-- we were in his house, of course, he was there ready to go. And he was on time. And he clearly is very anguished by this whole situation. I know that this is an attempt at damage control. Who's calling us, Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I don't know.\n\nGAYLE KING: I-- I know that is clearly an attempt at damage control, but I didn't feel that he was spinning a story. I think he's anguished, I think he's very sincere. And I think that he's hoping that once voters and viewers hear his story, that they will reconsider the calls for his resignation. That said, he's not planning to go anywhere. He thinks that he-- he-- he feels he is in a very unique position to lead Virginia to another way, and that this is actually, as painful as it is, a very good conversation for us all to have.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He thinks he can ride this out?\n\nGAYLE KING: I think he is hoping he can ride it out. He is not going to step down. He is not going-- I even asked, Under what circumstances would you step down? And he couldn't even give-- he did not want to give an answer to that question because that is not how he is thinking, that is not what he wants, and that's not what he believes that he should step down.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think, though, about-- what this has sparked in terms of a national conversation? I mean, this is a state that has a long-troubled history with race. It was the capital of the Confederacy.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This has really resonated around the country.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. And he is aware of all of that. And I think I said, Listen, in Virginia you have one, two, three people that are involved in a very messy scandal all at the same time. What do you make of that? He knows that the optics aren't good. He said, But I am concentrating on my battle and my fight. And I want to figure out a way how can I turn this around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and you continued your conversation with him. Let's play that clip.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nGAYLE KING: Let's talk about Justin Fairfax.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: In the beginning, he did not call for your resignation. He said, you know, Let the Governor decide. I know the Governor will make the right decision. But now his story has also changed.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: As you know, two women have come out and accused him of sexual assault--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: --sexual inappropriateness. And they have both said that if there is an impeachment hearing that they will testify against him. Where do you sit on how you feel about Justin Fairfax today? Are you too calling for him to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: I can only imagine that it must take tremendous courage for women to step forward and-- and talk about these things that-- these are so hurtful. And-- and these accusations are very, very serious. They need to be taken seriously. As you know, Governor Fairfax has called for an investigation. I really think where we are now. We need to get to the truth. The-- the truth-- the truth is important and certainly is--\n\nGAYLE KING: He is-- he too is calling for an investigation.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes. He is and I support that. And-- and if these accusations are determined to be true, I don't think he is going to have any other option but to resign.\n\nGAYLE KING: At this time, do you think he should resign?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: That's going to be a decision that he needs to make.\n\nGAYLE KING: I know he needs to make it, but what do you think? Do you think he--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again, I want the truth to come out. I-- I certainly support an investigation. And again, these accusation-- accusations are very serious. And we need to get to the bottom of them.\n\nGAYLE KING: And now your attorney general is also-- also has some explaining to do about--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yeah.\n\nGAYLE KING: --his use of blackface. He said it was because it was Halloween and he was dressed up as his favorite-- one of his favorite rappers, Kurtis Blow.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: Calls for him to resign, as well.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: Your thoughts about that?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, I know Attorney General Herring well, as I do Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, and you know we have all grown. I don't know what the attorney general was thinking, what his perception was of-- of race, of-- of the use of blackface back then. But I can tell you that I am sure, just like me, he has grown, he has served Virginia well. And he and I and Justin, all three of us have fought for equality.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so again, I regret that our attorney general is in this position. But this is a decision that he's going to need to make.\n\n(End VT)\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah. Lots of decisions that need to be made. He has not spoken, I thought-- I thought this was interesting. He has not spoken to Justin Fairfax since this second accusation came out. And I said, Why haven't the two of you communicated? And he said, You know, well, I am dealing with what I'm dealing with. He is dealing with what he is dealing with, and I'm concentrating on this. I do know that the wives have reached out to one another. I was told that today.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah. But the-- the two of them have not spoken.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, we'll be watching the rest of this interview on CBS THIS MORNING.\n\nGAYLE KING: Oh.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, we talked to him about the moonwalk. We talked about his wife, we talked about--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: --how this all came about. There are-- I'll just say, Margaret, we have a lot of interesting information that we'll have tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING. I know you're ready for me to go.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No. Gayle, we love that you are here--\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and you brought that. I want to get reaction to your--\n\nGAYLE KING: All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --interview, actually.\n\nAnd we have someone on set to do just that. Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, who represents Northern Virginia in Congress. Congresswoman, I-- I know you know Governor Northam.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON (D-Virginia/@RepWexton): I do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He campaigned for you. The contrition you heard there, is that enough for you to say he does not need to resign?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: It does not change my opinion that he needs to resign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Because I don't believe he can effectively lead co-- the commonwealth at this time. I mean, I understand that he wants-- that he is feeling contrition, that he is feeling regret. But we need somebody who-- who cannot only address the wrongs of the past but take Virginia into the future. And I think he's lost the confidence of the people in order to be able to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And yet The Washington Post had a poll out that published overnight and it said Virginians are split. But an interesting portion of that said the majority of black residents say he should remain in office. Is that black-- public opinion persuasive to you at all?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, I mean that's-- everybody's entitled to their opinion and that's-- that's persuasive. But remember he-- he won a vast majority of the black vote in his election. And we're not talking about approval numbers. We're talking about people who feel that the governor should step down immediately. So, it's a very different situation. The fact is, he's really lost the confidence of a lot of the people he's supposed to be leading.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And what about the Attorney General Herring who also admitted to having appeared in blackface in the past? Should he resign?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, his situation is different and I judge each situation on its merits. The attorney general came forward proactively, is very regretful and contrite. He reached out to all the African-American leaders and-- and other leaders, very heartfelt anguish about what he had done. But he's got a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people of Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're withholding judgment?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I'm withholding judgment.\n\nGAYLE KING: Margaret, can I ask you a question? Am I still on mic? No.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I don't know that you are. Sorry, what is your question, Gayle?\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, when you said that he's lost the confidence, he realizes that. But he also wants a chance to regain the confidence. Do you think he deserves that? He knows that he's lost everyone's confidence.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: But he still needs to be able to govern.\n\nGAYLE KING: Okay.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: And that's the problem. If he's spending his entire rest of his term apologizing and trying to preserve his own reputation and his legacy, he's not going to be an effective--\n\nGAYLE KING: Okay.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: --governor for the people of the commonwealth. I don't-- I don't think the governor is that selfish at the end of the day.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to make sure we also talk about the Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax because I know you have strong feelings about him as well. He has made clear he's not going to resign. Do you expect there to be an attempt to impeach him?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, one of the members of the House of Delegates has said that he intends to file articles of impeachment next week. That's a decision that my-- my former colleagues in the General Assembly are going to have to make about-- about how that plays out. But I expect that the lieutenant governor will do the right thing for Virginia and resign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two of your Democratic colleagues, Senator Warner and Congressman Scott have-- have sort of hedged their criticisms saying if true. Is there a possibility that Justin Fairfax is unfairly accused here?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: He is the subject of two extremely credible corroborated accusations of serious sexual assault. That's the situation we're looking at right now. It seems highly unlikely that these women would come forward and subject themselves to this kind of abuse if these allegations were not factual.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because I think a lot of people ask, where is the benchmark for you believing the accuser versus believing the lieutenant governor? And they apply that to various different cases whether it was Justice Kavanaugh or their own personal experience. For you, what is the benchmark?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I don't know that I can say that there is a particular benchmark, I judge every case and every-- every complainant and every situation on its merits. You know, I was also a prosecutor and this is not an issue where we need to prove something to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Elected leaders need to be held to a higher standard and where there are credible allegations-- corroborated allegations of serious sexual assault. We're talking about rape and forcible sodomy. This is something that impacts his ability to lead in future.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Democratic Party has really tried to stake out a moral high ground on issues of race, on issues of gender and sexual assault. Do you think these stories--three Democrats here--do you think that this has damaged the party?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I think that our reaction to the-- to these stories shows how seriously we take these allegations and-- and-- and conduct of our elected officials. You know, the good news is Democratic elected leadership-- Democratic leadership doesn't begin and end with the three men serving in elected office in Virginia right now in statewide office. We have a vast numbers (sic) of really talented, diverse, hardworking, capable leaders who are able to step up and fill the void that-- that will be left.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman thank you for joining us. Gayle King, thank you--\n\nGAYLE KING: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --for being here with us\n\nWhen we come back, we'll talk with another Virginia Democrat, former lieutenant governor, now Congressman Don Beyer. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For some more perspective we turn to Virginia Congressman Don Bayer-- Beyer who also served as the commonwealth's lieutenant governor. You jinxed me there congressman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER (D-Virginia/@RepDonBeyer): I'm sorry, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I mu-- muddled your name there. You heard the conversation we just had with Congresswoman Wexton and with Gayle King. Do you agree? Do you think that the governor still needs to step down?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I do. And-- and I think that just the-- the great confusion last weekend where he wasn't sure whether he was in the Klan robe or the blackface, has just sacrificed so much of his credibility and his ability to lead. You know, I know he's determined to go on this reconciliation tour but I think he should do that as a private citizen, rather than as the governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think because of this experience, as he argued in that interview with Gayle, that he can now have the authority to reach out in a significant way on racial issues?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Well, I know that's what he wants to do. And I-- I respect him. I know he wants to rehabilitate his reputation and-- and even his sense of what he called his moral compass. But he sacrificed so much of his ability to govern effectively. Figured the Legislative Black Caucus in Richmond, the Congressional Black Caucus on the Hill, virtually every African-American leader I know, has said that he needs to resign and the-- the Post poll that we've talked about before--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: --one of things we missed is that forty percent of black Virginians think he shouldn't remain. That's-- that's a damning number for a Democratic governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The governor's a peer of yours. Do you think that the-- the time, the place, the context of any of this should be considered in placing judgment on him?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yes it should. And I think that's one of the differences between Governor Northam and Attorney General Herring. They both made dumb mistakes as young men. Governor Herring though, or Lieutenant Attorney General rather, has been incredibly remorseful, very simple, took it very responsibly. The way our-- my-- Governor Northam handled the first couple of days was confusing, even bizarre. And he's also in a different role. The attorney general is-- runs the state's largest law firm, whereas the governor really has to be the role model for more than eight million people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Attorney General Herring who you just brought up also admitted to having worn blackface at one point. If he resigns, the next in line is a Republican.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Cynics would look at this and say the calculus to not be as harsh on the attorney general is influenced by that.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yeah, but I don't think that's actually true. There are-- there are cynics who say this is about the next election. But I think it's much more about values. We would move from a progressive, very strong attorney general to someone, who is not just a Republican, but someone who is on the arch conservative end of it. So, the way our laws would be administered Virginia would be completely different. This isn't about party politics as much it is about the kind of Virginia that we want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Now, the Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax, now two of the accusers have said that they would publicly testify should there be impeachment proceedings. There was no formal investigation here. Does one need to happen?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I don't really know how that happens. I mean, maybe the impeachment proceeding does that. I know the lieutenant governor has called for an FBI investigation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: We'll see any way that particularly happens. You know, this whole notion of how do you adjudicate guilt here is very difficult. I believe both women. I see no reason why they would come forward. They have nothing to gain. There is no lawsuit. There's no money involved. These were all documented some years back. It wasn't created overnight and I believe the women and I think if you believe the women, we have no-- no call but to call for his resignation. No choice.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, thank you very much for giving us your perspective.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more FACE THE NATION in just a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. He is the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and one of President Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill. Good to have you here.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS (R-North Carolina/@RepMarkMeadows): It's great to be with you. Thanks so much.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was on a number of networks this morning and said he absolutely cannot rule out another shutdown this week. Would you support one?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think that that's accurate. Obviously, no one wants it, the President doesn't want it. Mick doesn't want it. I don't want it. At-- at the same time what we're seeing with these negotiations going on-- I-- I don't know that they're real serious about reaching a compromise. I mean, they've met twice in-- in almost two weeks now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And yet Senator Shelby was so optimistic after he met with the President this week.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I-- I-- I heard that and-- and Senator Shelby is a, you know, a very seasoned negotiator and-- and-- and certainly when you look at-- at his conversations, you can draw some optimism from it. But I can tell you based on my conversations with conferees and a number of rank and file, there are distinct differences. And-- and here's-- here's what I'm concerned about. Border patrol came in to brief the conference. They gave their top three priorities and the conferees have said zero money for those top three priorities. How can you be serious about securing our border if the very people that are experts on securing it say these are our top three priorities, we need money. And yet they're saying zero dollars for that. I-- I don't understand that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is it that you need to see in order to get your vote and that of your caucus?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think we need to make sure that our border is secure, not just from a standpoint of strategic fencing or border slats, whatever you want to call it, but we need to make sure that once and for all we secure our border to make sure our communities are safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that means explicit wording that says what?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think what it means is-- is some amount of funny-- funding that gives border patrol section chiefs the ability to establish priorities, work with the administration on doing that and secure part of the Rio Grande Valley. You know, when we look at-- at some thirty to forty percent of those who come here illegally, they come through one corridor that-- that many times is-- is left open. We need to secure it. That requires some type of physical barrier. And-- and certainly we would support that. If that number is less than 5.7 billion, certainly everyone should be willing to compromise. I know I am and we'll find that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two billion would be the compromise that the White House would--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I've-- I've heard that reported honestly when you look at zero to 5.7, somewhere in the mi-- middle would be, you know, a two-billion to three-billion-dollar range. But it's not as much just the dollar amount. It's the flexibility and how to spend it. I think what Democrats are trying to do is say you can spend it here, you can't spend it there. And really the experts should be the ones deciding how we spend it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two of the Senators involved in negotiations were on Fox today saying that one of the sticking points is the number of ICE agents. What is that--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I think--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -issue?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --it's more detention beds when-- when we look at-- at ICE versus detention-- detention beds and what they're talking about is those who come across the border illegally, cutting down on the number of beds which would actually force them being released into the United States and so it's-- it's more of an open border policy that some Democrats have supported in the past. And-- and I don't think that-- that's-- in fact I know that's not going to be supported by this administration.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, we are just days away from running out of money.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How does this end? And do you expect the President to declare a national emergency?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I do expect the President and take some kind of executive action--a national emergency is certainly part of that. There are a few other things in his toolbox that he could use. But I do expect him to do that if we don't reach a compromise. And-- and, listen we have about twenty-four hours to do that. At this point they're going to need to look at some type of funding measure to make sure that we don't have a lapse, whether that's a clean CR for a short-term basis or a-- a longer period going through the end of September. They need to make sure that they have something on the table and ready to be voted on in the Senate where we could pass it in the House without a lapse in funding.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, you and your fellow Republican colleagues were incredibly critical of the last administration when they used executive action that bypassed the will and consent of Congress. How can you support it this time?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: You know I have been. And-- and here's one of the things that I would reach out to my Democrat colleagues. If once and for all you're wanting to work in a bipartisan manner, to return the power back to Congress, I'm willing-- I'm-- I'm willing to do that even now with this President, with our President's party in-- in the White House, I'm willing to do that. But until we do that, why should we allow a Democrat president in the White House to use executive orders and-- and not do the same with a Republican president. I've put forth measures that would actually eliminate some of the executive branch power.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: You know philosophically, that's where I am. And yet, at this point, we have a crisis. We have a crisis with a need to secure the border that we have to do. And this President is going to build a wall one way or another.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for giving us your perspective.\n\nWe will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and is now a columnist with The New York Times. Jonah Goldberg is the senior editor for the National Review. Margaret Talev is a senior White House Correspondent for Bloomberg News. And we have our own political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, it's good to have you here. I know you've been in Richmond for like ten days now--\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Something like that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --covering the story. You heard Gayle King's interview with the governor. What did you make of what he said?\n\nED O'KEEFE: I-- you know, clearly, he's bound and determined to stay. And there is some evidence this morning that Virginians, at least half of them, may be okay with that. What I thought was interesting though is that he still clearly hasn't come up with some specific plan on how to move forward other than he mentioned, and I don't believe we aired this part, but he talks later about concerns of infant mortality in the state--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --and trying to tackle issues like that over next three years. People need to remember outside of Virginia, they only get elected to one term as governor, so he's a lame duck immediately. So, if he stay, he stays and there's no political retribution for him, but there clearly could be for his party. And I think it's-- it's still an open question as to whether Democrats are really going to tolerate him being in office for the next three years. There are legislative elections later this year. Mark Warner, the senior Senator is up for reelection next year while it's also a presidential year and the thirteen electoral votes in Virginia are ones both parties desperately want. And if these guys are still around, all three of them, even just one or two of them, it could be radioactive for Democrats.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, you're a Virginian. But looking not just at this as a state story but as a national one, why-- why do you think this is resonating?\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie): I think there are a variety of issues, I mean, with Northam and Herring in particular, there is sort of the-- this larger national reckoning with racism that's ongoing. In some-- to some extent prompted by the President and the President's sort of use of-- of racialized rhetoric and-- and racist rhetoric over his term. And I think Democrats and Virginia Democrats nationally are seeking to kind of basic (INDISTINCT) of zero tolerance for anything like that to create a contrast by saying, in our party, if you have any sort of like whiff of racism in your past or present, that kind of renders you radioactive for-- for the rest of the party. And so, I think that is kind of what is driving this. I think also there is just the element of-- it's-- it feels so old-fashioned, and I think just talking to people who are not Virginians, even talking to Virginians, sort shocked that in 2019 an entire state is facing controversies over blackface, a thing that I think many observers would have thought is in-- in our past or at least recognized as being unacceptable. And so, I think that the shock and surprise of just the circumstances of the controversy, plus the-- the way it resonates in our current national politics has come to driving a lot of-- a lot of the attention.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jonah, the President weighs in on a lot of things, and he weighed in on this a few times this week. And then this morning said, African-Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia. It's not clear what he was referring to, it might have been this Washington Post poll that said the majority of black residents were okay with Northam remaining in office. Why weigh into this?\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG (National Review/@JonahNRO): Because he is like the Norse god Loki. He likes to create drama. He is a master at trolling and creating division. And-- and he was watching-- I think he was watching CNN, Jake Tapper tweeted that. This tweet came right after a conversation along these lines. There-- there are African-American politicians in Virginia, as I understand it, who think the calls for Fairfax to resign are unfair given the fact that, you know, for all the usual understandable partisan politics reasons. And Donald Trump is very good at sort of making-- of-- of sewing division and-- and-- and trolling this kind of stuff. And he gets, from-- from his perspective, pretty good results when he does.\n\nMARGARET TALEV (Bloomberg News/@margarettalev): But-- well, you know, some-- to some extent, what's going on in Virginia is really about these three politicians and they're kind of youth or semi-youth catching up to them. But if you're following 2020, it's so hard to miss the preview of what's to come, you've got this potentially huge Democratic field with cross sections that involve a lot of women, a handful of African-American candidates, and a lot of older white men who have had decades of yearbooks and past statements and-- and sort of generational political shifts where things like three strikes you're out or, you know, whatever, the way you talk about crime, the way you talk about welfare have changed over the years. And so, to some extent, I think it does give us a-- a preview and gives the Democratic Party a preview of the pitfalls of zero tolerance, and also the kind of traps of saying we're going to hold ourselves to a higher standard than-- than President Trump or-- or his party.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: My colleague Rich Lowry says-- has this line where he says the Democrats are going through the first woke primary.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Yeah.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: --where everybody is trying to prove that they're zero-tolerance people, that they're-- they-- they check all the boxes on social justice stuff. And this is, you know, a radioactive mess if everybody is trying to be, you know, sort of (INDISTINCT) than now and purer than now in the Democratic 2020 primary.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Probably, I think--\n\nED O'KEEFE: And you just wonder when the rush to judgment and the inability to stop, take a breath, and wait a second might catch up to them because two or three times this week they've all rushed out and said, he's got to go--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --whoever it was. Well, you know, then you ask-- you hear them saying, give us a little time to seek forgiveness and understanding or for due process. And it's like, how-- you know, are they potentially putting themselves in an even bigger box if they don't say, you know what, I'm not from Virginia, why don't we let this sort itself out there and see what happens?\n\nMARGARET TALEV: And the media plays the role and that will also play out over the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET TALEV: --next election cycle also.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, I want to pick up on something you touched on earlier.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it this way. It says Democrats believe they must sacrifice Mister Northam to preserve the sword they have made of racial politics for routine use against Republicans. Racism has become the default charge for any GOP policy they dislike on crime, immigration, education, the environment, you name it. The argument is this is tactics. Not true.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: So I-- I don't think it's tactics because I-- I do think there's-- there's substance here, right? The-- the Northam yearbook photo is genuinely shocking. It is genuinely shocking to see someone dressed up as a Sambo next to someone dressed up as a Klansman, two things that evoke very painful history and a painful like you see in this country that affects people living today, people alive, people I've spoken to and living, you know, quite recently have experienced these things. And so, I think-- I think the substance is important. I don't think-- I think trying to-- I think Democrats in Virginia and Democrats natural-- nationally are trying to reconcile the-- the fact that there is a substance here with these emerging political standards, with sort of like, yes, the tactical stuff. But I don't think this is a pure, like immoral power politics. I think I'll also add that-- and I think, Margaret, you made a really good point tying this to 2020 that there already has been-- there already are signs the Democrats are looking for my diverse candidates or looking for candidates who are sort of-- aren't tied to legacies of the politics or the '90s and the '80s. And I do think this very much kind of makes that even more solid and in-- in a weird way, even though, you know, I'm reasonably sure Joe Biden has nothing like this in the past. It may-- it may cripple Joe Biden's attempt to run. It may damage Bernie Sanders' attempt to run that just the-- the optics of this are going to reverberate throughout Democratic politics next year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about Elizabeth Warren? Because you saw this week, another issue here of identity and of race. She, it was revealed according to Texas State Bar Application, self-identified as Native American on that and-- and critics seized on this saying, this wasn't an issue of true identity. This was her seeking to advance herself by asking for special treatment. Does this stick to her?\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's-- it's already sticking. It's clearly sticking. And they know this. And I think to the point about this being a woke primary, that's the element of this that her team didn't anticipate. They thought they get credit for being as transparent as possible, releasing tax return to allowing a thorough review by the Boston Global for employment history and then releasing a DNA test because it would provide such a sharp contrast of the President who doesn't release any information despite the fact that he won and is still in office. But what they didn't anticipate was that by identifying that way when you clearly aren't or only a minuscule part of you is, it suggests that you were trying the take advantage of somebody else's heritage. And that is an-- is an-- is a radioactive element of this that they just are not prepared for. And I think she is going to suffer throughout this campaign, whether they like it or not. And there has been this attitude from her team of, well, we put it all out there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Don't we get credit for that? Yeah. But when you can't verify that you have every document and which she's done this, and we don't know whether she and her family spent decades identifying this way, potentially to their advantage, then it invites the scrutiny that they're getting and will continue to get.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And, Jonah, the President again weighing in on this in a tweet not only mockingly calling her Pocahontas, but then using the term TRAIL, all caps, which many read as a nod to the Trail of Tears, the-- the forceable relocation of thousands of Native Americans leading to mass death, is he going to be paid-- paying a price for that?\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: No. I mean, I-- like I--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, have the-- we're talking about this as if these politics of race should have a cost to them.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the caveat seems to be in the case of the President, you're saying, no, it's actually a tactic that can be to his benefit.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: Well, I-- I just think all of this is baked in with President Trump. The President Trump you see allegedly mocking the Trail of Tears is the same President who mocked parents of gold star families. Everyone has made up their mind about the guy, and that's-- there's a reason why he's never made it out of the forties in approval rating and his real-- his support is about thirty-five percent of the electorate, which gets us to the fact that this-- there's-- if you just look at the math of the electoral college and his approval rating, there is almost literally no way Donald Trump can affirmatively win in 2020. But the Democrats can certainly lose. And if you look at the way these fights are shaping up, if you look at the way the Democrats this last week walked into Donald Trump's thing at the State of the Union about how we're never going to be a socialist country by unveiling in not great fashion the green new deal, it does seem like the Democrats are in danger of spiraling off to exactly the place where the White House wants them to be.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And along those lines, the issue of abortion, very divisive, also reignited. That's where the scrutiny of Northam came from in the first place because of this radio interview he did, Margaret. And Republicans are arguing that Democrats are out of step with public opinion on abortion. Gallup poll conducted in May 2018 showed sixty percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in the first trimester, thirteen percent when asked about terminations in the third trimester. And that's where Northam's comments were directed, that later part.\n\nMARGARET TALEV: Yeah, this is part of, sort of, a larger effort by-- you know, by some Republican strategists to-- to try to paint the Democrats to the extremes because the battle is fought in the middle on these sorts of issues. It's much tougher for Donald Trump and his-- and-- and that segment of kind of the Republican ideological arm, whereas if you're talking not about a woman's right to choose but if you're talking about something that most Americans find extremely reprehensible. If you can redefine what it means to support abortion rights, you can redefine how you feel about Democratic candidates. And I think going to our other conversation, you know, the Trump base is demonstrably different than-- than the Democratic Party's base, which is why there is asymmetrical and there's two different standards for how you talk about racial issues or gender issues or-- or, you know, sort of anything in the spectrum that we have been talking about this morning.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Just also on that point, I think there is something in terms of public perception in the fact that we were referencing a woke primary. I think the term, Woke, gets to it, which is that there is a sense-- a broad sense that talking about race and racism, talking about identity, it's somehow opportunistic, is somehow not quite sincere in that. On the other end, President Trump sort of like open use of racist language, regardless of what people think about it, reads as somehow more authentic. And I think that there is-- there is a-- there is a-- I'm not saying that it is authentic, but that there is like this Archie Bunker quality to it that I think people are willing to look--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: --past versus a kind of suspicion based on this country's history with racism--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: --of anyone talking about it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. We'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration missed a congressional deadline to officially weigh in on whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. We spoke Friday, the day of that deadline with the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir and asked him about his meeting with the secretary of state earlier in the week.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR (Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs/@AdelAljubeir): The-- the death of Jamal Khashoggi was a mass-- massive tragedy. It was a mistake. It was committed by officials of the Saudi government acting outside their scope of authority. The king ordered investigation. The investigation led to the arrest of a number of individuals. Those-- eleven of those individuals have been charged by the public prosecutor, and the trials have begun. We have said we will investigate. We will hold those accountable-- those responsible accountable and we will punish them. The crown prince had nothing to do with this. There was no order given to murder Jamal Khashoggi and-- and the whole country is shocked by this. The trial is taking place. What I tell people is wait until the legal process plays out and then judge us. But don't judge us before the process is complete.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what the secretary of state told you, that he agrees with your assessment that the crown prince had nothing to do with it?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I believe that the positions of the President and the secretary of state were very clear. They said that the evidence doesn't-- there is no evidence that points in that direction.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The intelligence community, though, had a very different conclusion here and after the CIA director briefed Congress on the details of what the CIA had found, the Senate then passed a bill saying undoubtedly the crown prince knew about what happened.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I don't know what the CIA briefed them but I don't-- I believe that the same briefing that the President and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense at the time received did not point in that direction. So, I think there's a-- there's-- there may be emotions here, there may be exaggerations here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been briefed on what the CIA determined?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I personally have not. No. But we have communications with them through intelligence channels.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And that intelligence relationship is one of the strongest assets of the work between our two countries. So, I know you would think highly of the CIA and its assessment. When it comes to your own internal investigations, in October is when this murder happened.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where is Jamal Khashoggi's body?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We don't know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean you don't know?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We don't know. They said that the-- the public prosecutor is working to try to establish this fact. We have asked for evidence from Turkey, and he asked them several times, formally, through formal legal channels to provide evidence. We are still waiting to receive any evidence they may have.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're blaming the Turkish government?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: No, I'm blaming the murderers who committed this crime.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have them, you say, in custody though.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They can't tell you where the body is?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We are still investigating. There-- we have now-- a number of-- of possibilities and we're asking them what they did with the body, and I think this investigation is ongoing, and I would expect that eventually we will find the truth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The New York Times has new reporting out, and I'm sure you've seen the story, detailing how U.S. intelligence intercepted communications of the crown prince telling a top aide in 2017 that he would, quote, use a bullet on Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi if he did not return to the kingdom and end his criticism of the Saudi government. What was he talking about?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I'm not going to comment on reports based on anonymous sources. We have seen many such reports in over the past two or three months that turned out to be incorrect, or that turned out to-- that turned out to be incorrect frankly. And so, I don't know this-- this-- the background. The crown prince, we know, did not order this. This was not a government sanctioned operation. We have an investigation and we have a trial. And many things have been put out that turned out to be incorrect.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Did the crown prince know of the murder? You're saying he didn't direct it.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Of course not. Of course not. Nobody in Saudi Arabia knew about the murder except the people who did it. That's why when the team came back we said, as far as we know he left the consulate through the backdoor. It turned out to be false. And that's when the king asked for an investigation to be launched. The prosecution launched the investigation. The public prosecutor determined that something went wrong, brought in the people who were in the mission and basically detained them and questioned them and established that yes, they did in fact murder him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you realize though that there's a lot of skepticism, that there would be this level of dissent to have that large number of people defy the monarch and the crown prince and carry out such a rogue operation?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: It's-- Oliver North was involved in Iran-Contra. And he thought that Ronald Reagan wanted this. And Ronald Reagan did not want this at all. Abu Ghraib, you had people abusing prisoners and the President and the vice president and the secretary of state were not even aware of it. Unfortunately people make mistakes. Unfortunately people exceed their authorities. Unfortunately people do things wrong. We have done the right thing. We acknowledged that this happened. We acknowledged that these were officials of the Saudi government. We acknowledged that this-- they had no authority to do this, and we jailed them. And now we're putting them on trial.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns the Washington Post, is accusing AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, for essentially trying to extort him with these incriminating photos. He personally said though that the Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder, specifically of Khashoggi, was undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles. Did the Saudi government have anything to do with these leaks to AMI?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Absolutely not. This sounds to me like a soap opera. I've been watching it on television and reading about it in the paper. This is something between the two parties. We have nothing to do with it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, can you say though that the Saudi government and any of its employees or its, you know, contractors that it works with, definitively that they had no contact--\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --with David Pecker or AMI?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: That's as far as I'm aware. And I believe I would be aware. We have ab-- absolutely nothing to do with this. We-- maybe some of our citizens read The National Enquirer when they're in the United States. Other citizens watch the soap opera unfold on television, but that's it.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The full interview with minister al-Jubeir is on our website at facethenation.com. We'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The final push to eliminate ISIS forces from Syria has begun. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata filed this report from the front lines.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): At full sprint we raced through a desert wasteland of former ISIS territory in eastern Syria toward the last sliver of land still under the group's control. Years of battle etched on the face of our chain-smoking escort behind the wheel. Up the stairs in a bombed-out home, the rooftop provides a glimpse of the final ISIS village of Baghuz Fawqani. Women in black burqas, trucks, motorcycles, daily life of all that's left in the dying days of this so-called caliphate.\n\n(Khaled Baran speaking foreign language)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA: Local commander Khaled Baran told us there had been a pause to let civilians leave before the final offensive, yet moments later, airstrikes in all probability from a U.S. warplane struck an ISIS position in the no man's land between the front line and the village. And then one much closer to us followed by a whizzing noise, what sounded like an incoming mortar that sent everyone scrambling. It's not clear how many ISIS militants remain holed up, but the past few days have seen an exodus of families along with some suspected ISIS fighters among them. They arrive hungry and cold to a desolate holding camp in the desert. The men separated from the women and interrogated.\n\nThey were promised a utopia of an Islamic State, but now these ISIS families have been reduced to eating American-made rations and living out of a hole in the ground.\n\nWhen we first visited the front lines a few weeks ago right beside local soldiers launching a barrage of mortars, we found some of the two thousand American troops who had been at the forefront of this fight. Their Kurdish allies have suffered grave losses, more than eight thousand fighters. They now worry the end of ISIS as a territorial force will hasten the withdrawal of U.S. troops they desperately rely on for advice, artillery, and especially air power.\n\nWe know how important America has been to the fight. Are you worried about what might happen after American forces leave?\n\n(Adnan Afreen (ph) speaking foreign language)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA: We started this together with Americans on the ground and their air support, Commander Adnan Afreen told us. Just before the end the American decision to withdraw, it's not a good decision, not the right time.\n\nISIS is cornered now. Territory once bigger than Indiana now reduced to a strip of land no larger than Central Park, and unlike every other battle here, this time there is no escape. There is nowhere left to run.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Our Charlie D'Agata reporting from Syria.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Please tune in to CBS THIS MORNING tomorrow for more of Gayle King's interview with Virginia Governor Northam, and Bob Schieffer filed a special tribute to the longest-serving member of Congress, John Dingell, who died on Friday.

OMAHA, Neb. - Investor Warren Buffett says he would be willing to sell Berkshire Hathaway's big investments in American Express, Coca-Cola and other companies if he found a significantly better option, but he still believes in those companies.\n\nBuffett appeared on CNBC Monday after meeting with roughly 40,000 Berkshire shareholders on Saturday.\n\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has held major stakes in American Express and Coca-Cola for decades, so the company would face a significant tax bill on the gains if he did ever sell those investments.\n\nBuffett says the tax implications are a factor in his decisions.\n\nBuffett says he likes owning roughly 15 percent of American Express' stock even though competitors are trying to develop a better way to process payments. Berkshire owns about a 9 percent stake in Coca-Cola Co.
WASHINGTON - MetLife (MET) has been fined $20 million by Wall Street's policing body for misleading customers in switching them from variable annuities contracts into more expensive ones.\n\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Tuesday the decision was its largest fine related to variable annuities, popular yet complex investments that have grabbed the attention of regulators in recent years. FINRA has taken hundreds of disciplinary actions against brokers and investment firms for abuses in sales of variable annuities.\n\nFINRA also ordered MetLife Securities Inc. to return $5 million to customers for making negligent material misrepresentations and omissions on applications for switching into new variable annuities contracts. Tens of thousands of customers were affected, the regulators said.\n\nNew York-based MetLife neither admitted nor denied the allegations.\n\nMetLife fully cooperated with the FINRA investigation and we are pleased to put this matter behind us, the company said in a statement.\n\nFINRA said that from 2009 through 2014, MetLife misrepresented or omitted one important fact related to the costs and guarantees of customers' current variable annuities contracts in 72 percent of the 35,500 replacement applications it approved. The company told customers that their current contract was more expensive than the recommended replacement, when in fact the current contract was less expensive, according to the regulators.\n\nIn addition, MetLife failed to tell customers that the recommended new contract would reduce or eliminate important features of the current contract, such as guaranteed income benefits and accrued death benefits.\n\nMetLife's variable annuities replacement business garnered it around $152 million in commissions over the period, FINRA said.\n\nSales of variable annuities, which are tax-deferred and often used to save for retirement, have ballooned in recent years. They're contracts with investors in which the company selling them agrees to make periodic payments to the investor. The periodic payouts change depending on the performance of the mutual funds, bonds or other investments linked to the annuities.\n\nThe Obama administration recently acted to require that brokers who recommend investments for retirement savers meet a stricter standard that now applies to registered advisers. The idea is to prevent brokers from steering customers into riskier investments because they pay the broker a high commission.\n\nVariable annuities are often the investment that brokers recommend for people's retirement accounts, especially when they're retiring or leaving a company and roll over their employer-based 401(k) account into an individual retirement account, or IRAs.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.-- A man described by a Florida federal judge as the boss of a $100 million-plus fraud factory that used thousands of stolen identities to illegally obtain income tax refunds was sentenced Thursday to nearly 20 years in prison.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas imposed the sentence on Harlan Money King Decoste, 27, who previously pleaded guilty to fraud, identity theft and other charges. Decoste had faced even more prison time, but Dimitrouleas gave him a slight break by using a somewhat lower tax-fraud loss estimate than the government.\n\nStill, the judge made clear Decoste got the longest prison sentence of the five men convicted in the case because he was in charge.\n\nI think it was a fraud factory, Dimitrouleas said at a hearing Thursday. He's the boss.\n\nInternal Revenue Service investigators say the group used a rented house in the quiet suburb of Miramar as the hub for 10 laptop computers used in an attempt to steal about $108 million between July 2011 and May 2013. The IRS estimated the men were able to fraudulently obtain at least $28.2 million in actual refunds using 29,000 separate stolen identities.\n\nThe operation broke wide open after police responded to a May 2013 home invasion robbery at the house and found the computers, stacks of cash, closets filled with expensive shoes and jewelry, watches, bags of marijuana and other drugs, and dozens of prepaid debit cards and credit cards.\n\nDecoste attorney Barry Greff insisted the IRS fraud estimates were vastly overblown. He said even the loot and cash recovered at the house was meager compared to the government's loss figures in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThere's just no way, Greff said. It is all based on speculation, conjecture and possibilities.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson said investigators had not been able to trace all of the stolen money but said the operation was among the largest tax refund fraud schemes the IRS has ever uncovered. Watson said Decoste was arrested in 2015 on similar charges in the Atlanta area and appeared to brag in recorded jail phone calls there about his abilities to steal.\n\nThey don't call me the Money King for no reason, Decoste said on one recorded call in which he told another person details of using stolen identities on tax forms.\n\nDecoste also created a purported rap label called GroundUp111 as a cover for the fraud business, Watson said. Other defendants were listed as officers of the so-called company, which did not produce any music.\n\nProsecutors are seizing the ill-gotten gains, including more than $174,000 in cash, the 10 computers, Rolex and other expensive watches and more than a dozen gold and diamond necklaces, chains and pendants. Most of the defendants also must pay as much as $28 million each in restitution to the government.
Washington — As early as Tuesday, the Biden administration will begin asking dozens of U.S. attorneys across the country to resign, a senior Justice Department official tells CBS News' Clare Hymes. They will include most of the ones who were appointed by former President Trump, as the Biden administration moves to transition to its own nominees, The Associated Press says.\n\nBut the U.S. attorney overseeing the federal tax probe involving President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, will remain in place, the official told Hymes. The acting attorney general, Monty Wilkinson, called U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the federal prosecutor's office in Delaware, and asked him to remain on the job, the official said.\n\nThe Justice Department has been investigating the finances of Hunter Biden, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions. The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president, two sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December after a round of subpoenas was issued in the case.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported that the subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden in December asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed in October by then-Attorney General William Barr as a special counsel to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, will remain in that capacity, the senior Justice Department official told Hymes, but Durham is expected to resign from his other position as the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.\n\nThe transition process, which happens routinely between administrations, is expected to take weeks and would apply to a few dozen U.S. attorneys who were appointed by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by Mr. Trump have already left their positions, some in recent weeks.\n\nIt's fairly customary for U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don't necessarily happen all at once.\n\nIn 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for the resignations of 46 U.S. attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nThe U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president and are generally nominated with a recommendation from a home-state senator. The 93 U.S. attorneys are responsible for overseeing the offices of federal prosecutors and charged with prosecuting federal crimes in their jurisdictions.\n\nThe Senate has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing for Mr. Biden's attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nCNN was first to report that the department was seeking the resignations.
In the years since the 2008 financial crisis, this southern U.S. port city has attracted a new Airbus factory, seen its steel industry retool, and gained thousands of jobs building the Navy's new combat vessel.\n\nSome 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure. As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern rust belt states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base.\n\nStates like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north.\n\nWhether the rust belt's expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises.\n\nFor a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data.\n\nThe analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment.\n\nFlorida, a state whose population has boomed under an influx of retirees, many of them from the north, was excluded.\n\nEconomists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in.\n\nLabor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land, said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting.\n\nIn the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with.\n\nDavid Fernandes, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, said that of the roughly 700,000 engines the factory made last year, half went to Mexico and Canada. The facility also makes engines for cars assembled at a Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky.\n\nAnything that hinders the opportunity to provide product to a customer is what is concerning, he said.\n\nPlants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion. Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day.\n\nGunmaker Remington Outdoor came to Huntsville lured by $110 million in tax and other concessions. Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago.\n\nJeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees.\n\nMany of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states.\n\nThe rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s.\n\nPopulation in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period. When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, there was no Minnesota play, said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville.\n\nThe market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500.\n\nGlobalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south. Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent.\n\nIn the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data. The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry.\n\nSupplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico. New industries, such as aerospace, followed.\n\nBoeing opened a new factory in Charleston, South Carolina, while decades of federal spending on space and defense programs created a pool of engineers in Alabama. A surge in energy and locally important industries like wood products added to the employment gains.\n\nJudith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million.\n\nThe vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here, Adams said.\n\nWhen European aircraft maker Airbus scouted sites for its $600 million North American plant more than a decade ago it settled on a former Air Force base in Mobile.\n\nAs it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes.\n\nWe looked at transportation costs, labor costs, productivity, and it made sense, said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group Inc. We will be building single aisle airplanes (in Mobile) for a long, long time.
A day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin suggested economic growth could pay for a majority of President Trump's tax reform proposal, debt hawks are sounding the alarm, warning that any tax overhaul must not add to the federal deficit.\n\nConservatives are eager to do tax reform, but they're also eager to address the massive debt and deficit, a top aide to one key GOP senator told CBS News. Tax reform that adds to the 10-year debt projection is pretty much dead on arrival with most Republican members of Congress.\n\nIf it's just pure tax cuts and no revenue-raising provisions, we don't predict that any tax cut will pay for itself. There's just no federal tax that's bad enough to raise sufficient revenue by eliminating it, explained Alan Cole, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation. It means you're punting on the question of how the revenue will eventually be raised to pay for this.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) added Friday in a release, Not paying for tax reform is extremely misguided, would explode the federal deficit and end up harming long-term economic growth prospects.\n\nOn Thursday, Mnuchin acknowledged that eliminating loopholes and deductions will finance only a portion of Mr. Trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the nation's tax code.\n\nThe deal will pay for itself, Mnuchin declared during a question-and-answer session at the Institute of International Finance's Washington Policy Summit. The secretary added, however, that the administration fundamentally believe[s] in dynamic scoring and will judge the proposal's impact on the deficit accordingly.\n\nSince a rule change in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office has gauged the cost of various proposals using two distinct methods: traditional scoring and dynamic scoring. The traditional scoring method looks only at the text of legislation to determine its impact on the deficit -- specifically, the money a bill proposes to spend, and the methods the bill proposes to pay for it. The dynamic scoring method, by contrast, adds to that calculation an estimate of the bill's impact on the broader economy.\n\nSome conservatives have long argued that the cost of tax cuts should be evaluated using dynamic scoring, rather than traditional scoring. They don't believe tax cuts must be fully paid-for in legislative text, clalming that the economic growth they create will counterbalance any additional money the tax cuts add to the national debt.\n\nSome deficit watchdogs, however, argue that past tax cuts haven't yielded the economic growth that proponents have promised. They believe dynamic scoring encourages fiscally irresponsible proposals that will blow up the deficit.\n\nThere is no evidence that broad-based tax cuts can pay for themselves completely, and economic studies from across the spectrum have found that deficit-financed tax cuts only pay for a fraction of their cost, the CFRB said in a blog post. Even if tax cuts could generate more growth than estimated, no plausible amount of economic growth would be able to pay for the tax plan, let alone reduce deficits.\n\nCFRB president Maya MacGuineas added in an email that the administration must decide how it wants to spend any revenue accrued through growth.\n\nThe administration has been saying they were going to use economic growth to deal with our fiscal challenges and reduce the debt. Now they want to use growth effects to pay for tax cuts, she explained. You shouldn't assume growth effects before they occur, and you sure shouldn't count them twice.
The Trump administration may direct the Internal Revenue Service to delay the April 15 tax filing deadline as part of the U.S. government's efforts to ease the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, an administration official told CBS News.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed in testimony Wednesday to the House Committee on Appropriations that he is considering providing substantial relief to certain taxpayers and giving extensions on tax filings, a move Mnuchin said would inject the equivalent of $200 billion into the U.S. economy.\n\nMnuchin also said that the government should pick up the costs for small and medium businesses whose workers have to self-quarantin or care for quarantined family members.\n\nThis is a little bit like a hurricane, and we need to cover these [costs] outside the normal expenses, he said.\n\nThe government is also considering guaranteed loans to industries hit hardest by the outbreak, such as airlines and cruise lines, Mnuchin said, although he insisted any funding did not amount to bailouts.\n\nThe Treasury chief's remarks came a day after some Democrats in Congress urged the IRS to consider a filing delay given the possibility of disruption from the outbreak.\n\n[W]e are concerned about the ability of the IRS to provide taxpayer assistance and process returns, as well as the ability of taxpayers, free tax-preparation sites, and tax professionals to meet the filing deadline, members of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote in a letter on Tuesday.\n\nThe agency has previously pushed back the tax filing deadline, including two years ago when the website to make payments suffered multiple outages hours before the deadline. The legislators noted in their letter Tuesday that the IRS already has authority to extend filing deadlines by up to six months, as well as to waive penalties.\n\nSo far this year, tax return filings have run mostly on schedule. The IRS had received 59 million tax returns as of the end of February, the same number as it had this time last year. That's just over a third of all the returns the agency expects to process this filing season.\n\nHowever, the spreading coronavirus could disrupt tax season, as many Americans rely on IRS field offices and volunteer centers for help with their filings.\n\nThe White House has also floated a number of possible measures to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus, including a temporary payroll tax cut.
Trump says he doesn't need to be tested for c...\n\nTrump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus\n\nTrump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus\n\nPresident Trump has not been tested for coronavirus, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday night in a statement.\n\nThe President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms, Grisham said. She added that Mr. Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.\n\nGrisham also cited CDC guidelines that say testing decisions should be based on symptoms and exposure history.\n\nFour GOP members of Congress — Senator Ted Cruz and Congressmen Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Doug Collins — are quarantining themselves after learning they had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, or coronavirus, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington last month.\n\nTwo of them had some exposure to Mr. Trump after the conference. Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with the president to Washington from Florida Monday. His office has said he isn't experiencing any symptoms and expects to receive the results of a COVID-19 test soon.\n\nCollins shook hands with Mr. Trump last week and visited the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta with him.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, will be going to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Republican lawmakers about economic measures the government could take to provide relief to those impacted by coronavirus. They're expected to discuss a payroll tax cut, aid for hourly wage earners to help them avoid lost wages, small business loans, and aid for the airline, cruise and hotel industries, which are suffering losses over fear about the spread of coronavirus.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's office is alleging former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort continued work related to Ukraine after his 2017 indictment, according to a redacted transcript from Manafort's hearing with federal prosecutors on Monday.\n\nThe hearing focused on whether Manafort breached his plea agreement by lying to investigators, including about his meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors allege Manafort was talking about a redacted issue related to Ukraine as late as 2018.\n\nThis goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating, prosecutor Andrew Weissman said, according to the transcript, about Manafort continuing to work with Kilimnik on Ukrainian issues.\n\nManafort's attorneys submitted a poorly redacted filing in January revealing Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign. In their response to Mueller claiming Manafort breached his plea deal, Manafort's attorneys inadvertently revealed the special counsel alleges Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nManafort and Rick Gates, his former business associate, were indicted by a federal grand jury in late 2017. He was found guilty on five counts of tax fraud, one count of failing to disclose his foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud, in August.\n\nManafort reached a plea agreement with Mueller's office on Sept. 14 to avoid a second trial on additional charges in D.C. District Court. Under the deal, Manafort pledged to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with Mueller's probe and any other investigation.
The IRS is giving all Texas residents and businesses an additional two months to file their federal income taxes, citing the deadly winter storm that left millions without power and water. Texans will now have until June 15 to file their 2020 returns, instead of the regular deadline of April 15, the tax agency said on Monday.\n\nThe extension also includes any taxes that would have been owed by April 15, as well as any business returns that otherwise would have been due on March 15, the IRS said. Texans also will have until June 15 to make 2020 IRA contributions, the agency said.\n\nThe extension will be automatic for anyone living in Texas, which means they won't have to file forms requesting more time to file.\n\nFollowing the recent disaster declaration issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the IRS is providing this relief to the entire state of Texas, the IRS said in a statement.\n\nTaxpayers in other states that have been affected by harsh winter weather may also receive the same extension for filing their returns, as long as their states receive similar FEMA disaster declarations due to the same storms, the IRS said.\n\nThe IRS last year extended the tax deadline for all U.S. taxpayers due to the coronavirus pandemic, although this year it plans to keep its regular April 15 deadline for 2020 tax returns. With about 29 million residents, Texans represent almost 9% of the U.S. population, which means about 1 in 10 taxpayers will get an extension on their taxes this year.
President-elect Donald Trump has no intention of giving up his Twitter account when he takes office, and the so-called Tweeter-in-chief said the followers should expect more posts.\n\nMr. Trump's ability to influence a company's stock prices with a single tweet is no secret -- just ask companies like Boeing, Ford, Toyota or Macy's. All it takes are 140 characters for him to move markets in a big way.\n\nSo one financial app, called Trigger, has even created an alert to notify users if Trump tweets about a company they have invested in, reports CBS News correspondent Alex Wagner.\n\nHe's tweeting about specific companies, calling them out on Twitter and that's having massive effects in the stock market, said Trigger CEO Rachel Mayer.\n\nAbbey Klaassen, chief marketing officer for ad agency 360i, said brands need to be ready for anything, because Trump's Twitter feed can instantly hurt or help a company.\n\nPresidents and brands have always intersected over the years, but this is an entirely new level of engagement, Klaassen said. It's about thinking through the motions of, 'Okay, how do we react if Trump tweeted this positive thing to us, if he tweeted this negative thing to us?'\n\nEarlier this month, he targeted General Motors on Twitter for Mexican-made Chevy Cruzes, threatening: make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax.\n\nGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017\n\nGM's stock dropped one percent. The company said most Cruze models are made in Ohio.\n\nLockheed Martin's shares also plummeted nearly three percent when Trump tweeted that the defense company's F-35 program costs were out of control. Lockheed's CEO personally vowed to lower costs.\n\nHits to both companies' stock prices were temporary.\n\n\n\nTrigger's app tracks major financial news and events -- or trigger -- to help investors. The latest Trump alert quickly became their most popular feature.\n\nOne single tweet we've seen can eradicate market cap losses in the billions of dollars. One single tweet can adjust the strategy of a large Fortune 500 company, Mayer said.\n\n\n\nKlaassen said some companies may profit.\n\nDo you think we're going to see the tables turn in the coming years where companies go after Trump in the hopes of bating themselves into a Twitter war and raising their public profile? Wagner asked.\n\nYou know the adage, about 'all publicity is good publicity?' I'm sure there will be companies out there that think that this is a great idea; I'm sure it will be a way to get on Trump's radar, Klaassen said. And if you're on Trump's radar, there's a good chance you're going to be on a lot of other people's radar very soon.\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of the companies featured on Mr. Trump's Twitter feed took hits, some companies have seen boosts. Fiat Chrysler saw an uptick in its stock price after a favorable tweet from the president-elect\n\nAccording to experts, the lasting effects of Mr. Trump's tweets on the economy and big business are yet to be seen.
If you're looking for a quick, low-cost way to pay off your student loans, you can find a few options. But while you may be able to consolidate or refinance (even private loans), you won't find many ways to significantly pay off those loans without forking over more money every month.\n\nHowever, if you have home equity, a new route to paying down student loans is now open. Fannie Mae, the federal mortgage financing company, recently announced a new program that allows student debt holders to swap student debt for mortgage debt.\n\nThe novel program permits mortgage originators that sell loans to the mortgage giant to offer a new refinance option for the purpose of paying off a student loan. Proceeds from the refinancing will go directly to the student loan servicer to fully pay off at least one loan.\n\nThat means you can exchange student loans for mortgage debt. That will indeed erase your student loans on paper, but what you owe isn't magically eliminated. It's added on to your mortgage obligation. And it could boomerang on you if you can't pay your mortgage: You could lose your home.\n\nAlthough you can often get a better rate on a home-equity loan than on most credit cards and installment loans, federal college financing is mostly pretty cheap. Federal student loan rates range from 3.76 percent (undergraduate) to 5.31 percent (graduate). They reset on July 1.\n\nPrivate home-equity loans range from 4 percent to 7.6 percent, according to Bankrate.com. The higher your credit score, generally, the lower your interest rate. Credit card rates are averaging 15 percent, according to creditcards.com.\n\nThe one exception to the low-rate student rate offerings are PLUS loans, which parents usually take out, pegged at 6.31 percent for this academic year. Note to parents: Avoid these loans at all cost.\n\nStill, the lure of rolling federal loans into a mortgage debt sounds tempting. But here are five major drawbacks you should be aware of:\n\nYou lose flexibility from the federal student loan program. Homeowners who tap home equity to pay off student debt give up their rights to income-driven repayment options on their federal student loans, which cap federal student loan payments at roughly 10 percent of their income, said Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Income-driven repayment is a critical safeguard during periods of unemployment or other income shocks that help avoid the consequences of default. Also, keep in mind that the federal college loan program has multiple repayment options.\n\nYou may not be able to have your federal student loan forgiven. This would apply to those in public service professions who may qualify for loan forgiveness after a decade.\n\nYou may not net a lower rate on your rolled in debt. As noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal. Federal Stafford Loans for undergraduate students have a low fixed rate, currently 3.76 percent, noted Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex, a college decision site. They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage.\n\nAs noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal.

The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan.  Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz.\n\nThe federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan. Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz. The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits.\n\nWhile plenty of factors argue against doing a mortgage debt swap with your student loans, there's one exception, Kantrowitz pointed out:\n\nThe only case in which a borrower might consider using a mortgage or home equity loan or line of credit to pay off student loans is if the student loan borrower has high-interest private student loans.\n\nThey might be able to save money through refinancing. Though, generally, if they have a high interest rate, they might be able to get a lower interest rate if their credit score has improved a lot since they borrowed the money. If they don't qualify for a lower rate on a private consolidation loan, they're unlikely to qualify for a home loan with a lower rate.\n\nThe bottom line with student debt management is to be careful. Look at all of the scenarios carefully and see how much you can save -- if you can reap any savings at all.
Two lawmakers from opposite coasts and different parties want to ease the burden on local governments and small businesses of operating during the pandemic by helping them purchase personal protective equipment and rapid testing equipment.\n\nThe Getting Americans Safely Back to Work Act, introduced Monday by Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger and California Republican Young Kim, would create a $1 billion block grant program for such purchases to be administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments. A quarter of the funds, $250 million, would be set aside to help small business like restaurants fully reopen. The bill was first reported by CBS News.\n\nIn conversations with Central Virginia small businesses, restaurants, and local governments, a major concern remains the continued cost of PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, Spanberger said. While these costs are high, employers recognize the importance of making these investments for both the safety of their employees and the health of our communities.\n\nHer cosponsor, freshmen representative Young Kim, who is a former small business owner, said it was an immediate and urgent priority to distribute rapid tests and personal protective equipment, both of which could be purchased with the grant program created by the bill. Funds could also used to implement any other workplace safety measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nThese costs have largely been borne by local businesses, who often see those safety measures as necessary to get customers back in the door.\n\nState and local governments around the country are also facing major budget shortfalls because of the declining tax revenues and the costs they have incurred to fight the pandemic. But they've been largely left out of COVID relief efforts — including the $900 billion package passed in December — because of Republican opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for Spanberger also said the congresswoman is actively working to include the provisions of the bill in the upcoming COVID relief package proposed by the White House that is working its way through the House and Senate.\n\nChesterfield County, Virginia Sheriff Karl Leonard said the legislation was a necessary step to reduce the risk for law enforcement officers and other employees in his county, including those who might have to contain a virus outbreak in a prison or jail.\n\nThis bill benefits our essential workers and our community as a whole, he said.
Washington — Congress and the White House moved quickly to craft the parameters of a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy in response to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday. Senate Republicans took the lead on a package that could cost upwards of $1 trillion.\n\nA senior Republican official told CBS News, based on Tuesday's lunch discussions with Senate Republicans and conversations with senators throughout the afternoon, that the package will likely include roughly $50 billion in assistance for airlines, $250 to $300 billion in small business loans, and $250 billion in direct payments for Americans to be paid in April.\n\nThese direct payments may be structured in a way similar to the tax rebate in 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. In that case, individuals received a designated amount, married couples received a certain amount, and additional funds were given based on the numbers of dependent children.\n\nThe direct payments are planned for those who fall beneath an income threshold. It's not yet clear how the payments will be funded. For the time present, the payroll tax holiday favored by the president is not under consideration in the package.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a press conference on Capitol Hill that senators will first vote on an earlier aid package that passed the House over the weekend before moving on to a much larger phase three deal outlined by administration officials just hours before.\n\nWe're going to move in warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly, McConnell said. These are not ordinary times. This is not an ordinary situation, and so it requires extraordinary measures.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the administration, traveled to the Hill to discuss the measure with senators over lunch on Tuesday.\n\nWe just finished discussions at the president's request with the Republicans. I know there's been some rumors of the number. It is a big number, Mnuchin said afterward. This is a very unique situation in this economy. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject a trillion dollars into the economy.\n\nThe phase three proposal follows an initial $8.3 billion measure passed earlier this month to boost emergency funding, and the House legislation approved early Saturday providing paid sick leave and family leave to some workers forced to remain at home over the outbreak. This phase two bill passed in the House has a potential price tag of $104.9 billion over ten years, per the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThe aide said that the phase two bill is expected to be passed in the Senate on Wednesday, and phase three by the end of the week.\n\nAt a press briefing at the White House, Mnuchin said the administration wants Congress to approve measures to get cash in the hands of consumers within the next two weeks, a proposal floated by Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton, among others.\n\nWe're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately, Mnuchin said. We have to do this now.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a press briefing with the coronavirus task force at the White House on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. AP\n\nMcConnell said senators will remain in Washington until they approve a phase three deal, and said Republicans who were reluctant to approve some provisions in the House's bill should put aside their concerns for the time being.\n\nWe're not leaving town until we have constructed and passed another bill, he said. My counsel to them is to gag and vote for them anyway, even if they have some shortcomings, and to address those shortcomings in the next bill.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will support the House bill. He had proposed his own phase-three deal worth $750 billion on Monday, but said Tuesday the final figure may have to be higher than $1 trillion.\n\nHouse leaders are also looking toward the next phase of the response, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi laying out Democratic priorities in a third package. In a statement, she said the third phase of the response should include expansions of sick leave and family leave for workers, as well as tax credits to support the self-employed and gig workers.\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters Monday that the price tag of any such measure was no issue for the president.\n\nThe president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we need to do and not be impeded by the potential price tag of what's necessary here, Ueland said.\n\nMnuchin echoed that point on Tuesday, saying concerns over the price tag for a stimulus bill are secondary.\n\nI've said in different times, we'll fix the deficit, he said. This is not the time to worry about it.
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion dollar coronavirus economic relief plan on Thursday evening. The expensive legislation contains three major targets: $400 billion for arresting the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccine capabilities; over $1 trillion to assist families needing direct financial support; and $440 billion in emergency funds for cash-poor small businesses and communities.\n\nI believe we have a moral obligation, Mr. Biden said in a speech on Thursday night from Wilmington, Delaware. In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry, we cannot let people get evicted, we cannot watch nurses, educators and others lose their jobs, we so badly need them. We must act now, and we must act decisively.\n\nMr. Biden in his American Rescue plan, calls for an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks for Americans, on top of the $600 that's already been approved, bringing the total stimulus to $2,000. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child.\n\nThis gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food and rent and other basic needs, as economists tell us that helps the whole economy grow, Mr. Biden said in the speech.\n\nThe president-elect also wants to implement emergency paid sick, family, and medical leave, stabilize childcare centers with $25 billion in emergency funding, and forestall COVID-related evictions.\n\nHis proposed legislation also would also initiate his push for a $15 national minimum wage and for ending the tipped minimum wage.\n\nMr. Biden on Thursday also laid the foundation on how his administration will change the vaccine distribution process. The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure so far, Mr. Biden said.\n\nMr. Biden is proposing $400 billion dollars to boost vaccine infrastructure, with a specific focus on increasing the number of community vaccine distribution locations. An incoming senior Biden administration official reiterated confidence that the goal of providing 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days would be met.\n\nThe incoming official said the number is not dependent on an additional vaccine becoming available, like the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine that is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration's authorization. Under the plan, the vaccine will be free and available to everyone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nMr. Biden said he will detail specific vaccination procedure changes on Friday.\n\nCOVID-19 testing would also be expanded, with an additional $50 billion. A 100,000-strong public health jobs corps would help spread factual information about the vaccine and to contact-trace COVID cases.\n\nMr. Biden's coronavirus package proposes $170 billion for updates to K-12 schools to ready them for in-class instruction again. Funds could be used to reduce class size, modify space, improve ventilation or provide additional funding for summer school to make up for lost time.\n\nHigher-education institutions, including public colleges, HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions, could receive $35 billion in assistance. Biden's plan details that millions of students could receive an additional $1,700 in financial assistance with this money.\n\nMr. Biden's proposal to eliminate $10,000 of student loan debt is not included in this plan, but an incoming senior Biden official said during a press briefing that he still supports this idea and reiterated the Biden administration's plan to continue the pause on student loan payments.\n\nFinally, to assist struggling businesses, Mr. Biden is asking for $15 billion dollars to go directly to 1 million small businesses. He also wants to increase loans to businesses in need. Community transportation, tribal communities, and technology investments are also included in the bill.\n\nThis is the first of two bills Mr. Biden plans to address COVID-19. Mr. Biden said Thursday evening he will introduce his recovery bill in February at a joint session of Congress.\n\nHow will Biden convince Congress to pass this bill?\n\n\n\nCBS News reported on Wednesday the Biden White House has already begun trying to line up bipartisan support for the COVID-relief package, which could mean significant changes to the legislation in order to attract more Republican support. This goal was also communicated to the congressional aides on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Biden proactively addressed critics who not share his optimism of striking a bipartisan deal, saying unity is not some pie-in-the-sky dream, it's a practical step to getting the things we have to get done as a country, get done together.\n\nIf Mr. Biden cannot reach a deal with Senate Republicans, this package could still pass under reconciliation, a process sometimes used for spending measures. Under this approach, the bill would require only a simple majority to pass and would not be subject to being blocked by a filibuster. Most Senate bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. This option would be used pass the Biden team's framework with only Democratic votes. Once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any ties. With Harris as the 51st vote, Democrats will control the Senate.\n\nThis legislation is likely to face intense lobbying from congressional members and special interests, which could affect the final price tag.
Now that tax day (plus one) has come and gone, millions of Americans are looking forward to refunds. After all, nearly 80 percent of individual filers get a check from the IRS. According to the agency's most recent data, it has processed more than 101 million returns and issued more than 79 million refunds totaling $226.6 billion so far. The average refund is $2,864.\n\nMost people like getting that financial boost, and when considering the opposite, who would disagree?\n\nBut when you get to the heart of the matter, a refund is the result of overpaying income taxes during the year. Worse, you must file a tax return to ask the IRS to return your overpayment. When else do Americans gladly overpay for something and wait till the next year to get a refund?\n\nGetting a big refund -- more than a thousand dollars -- while carrying expensive debt can be a financial mistake. It's better to reduce your tax withholding, which increases your take-home pay, and use the larger cash flow to pay off your debt. Of course, your tax refund the following year will be smaller, but your debt will be smaller, too.\n\nThe risk is that you may not withhold enough tax -- and then find that you owe tax when it's time to file your return. Nobody wants that. Which is why we overpay our taxes and are happy to get a refund.\n\nThe next question is: What to do with your tax refund?\n\nSome people will need it to pay for essentials, like rent, food and car expenses. Others will pay down debt or boost savings.\n\nThe IRS says nearly 90 percent of refunds are directly deposited into a bank account. But that can be a temptation to spend.\n\nSo if you really want to do something productive with your refund, the first step is to move it out of your bank and put it into another account that's harder to reach. If you don't already have one, consider opening brokerage account, mutual fund or retirement account.\n\nHere are a few other ideas for making good use of a tax refund:\n\nContribute to a health savings account. If you have a health insurance plan with a high deductible, you can open an HSA. These accounts allow pretax contributions, which grow tax deferred. And withdrawals used to pay qualifying medical expenses are tax-free. The 2018 HSA contribution limit is $3,450 for individuals and $6.900 for families (those 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000).\n\nPay down high interest rate debt. If you carry a balance on a credit card account, listen up. Interest rates are on the rise, and that means that your credit card debt will cost you more. The average rate on newly issued cards in 2018 has risen to 15.59 percent. When you pay down this debt, you'll also save money on interest and fees.\n\nIncrease contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan. Using your refund to save for retirement is a great move, especially when you get paid to do it. That's because many employers match their employees' contributions, for instance, 50 percent of the first 6 percent you contribute. That would put 9 percent of your pay into your 401(k).\n\nSave for your child's education. If you're planning to set aside savings for future education costs, consider opening a state-sponsored college savings plan. In one of these 529 savings plans, the money saved can be used tax-free to pay for future college tuition. Many states also offer a deduction on your state income tax return if you contribute to your own state's plan.\n\nMake extra mortgage payments. Finally, think about adding extra principal to your monthly mortgage payments. By making the equivalent of just one additional monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage each year, you can pay off that loan in about 18 years instead -- and save thousands of dollars in interest over that time.
Over the past decade, the much-vaunted freelance economy has spawned dozens of platforms designed to help people launch their unrealized dreams of independent work: from TaskRabbit to Fiverr to Upwork to Handy to the much-maligned Uber, to name just a handful.\n\nOne thing it doesn't seem to have created, though, is many full-time freelancers.\n\nThe portion of independent contractors in the workforce last year was slightly smaller than it was in 2005, according to figures released Thursday by the Labor Department. Just 6.9 percent of workers toiled primarily as independent contractors in 2017, down from 7.4 percent in 2005. There were slightly fewer on-call workers. The portion of temp workers and contract workers -- employees of a company who work for a client of their employer -- was flat.\n\n[I]t's hard for us to know if this reflects the strength of our economy or a structural shift, said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed. It seems likely that this is due to cyclical factors giving [freelance] workers the ability to negotiate themselves into more stable work arrangements.\n\nThe data are puzzling to some, since many other measures indicate that freelance and on-demand work has exploded since 2005. Some studies by gig-economy platforms put the portion of so-called independent workers at a third or more of the workforce.\n\nThe government study, however, has some key differences from industry research. It only asked about a person's primary job, so it doesn't capture freelancers who moonlight on top of a day job. And it is time-limited, so it only captures the freelance workers at a single point in time.\n\nPeople may be working one week and not the next week, so if you look at one week's worth of data you dramatically undercount the workforce, Stephane Kasriel, CEO of the freelancing platform Upwork, told CBS MoneyWatch. A substantial part of the workforce is moonlighting.\n\nStudies done differently, such as those that look at tax data, indicate the number of people who dabble in freelance work is substantially higher than those who use it to replace steady income.\n\nSeasonal changes could also be a factor: The previous survey was conducted in February, while the one released Thursday was conducted in May 2017.\n\nOh, & 2 big caveats about comparing this CWSto the prior one: reasonable to think that contingent work is seasonal, so that will explain some of the difference between Feb 2005 and May 2017. Also those 2 months very well might not be apples-to-apples in the business cycle either — Ernie Tedeschi (@ernietedeschi) June 7, 2018\n\nIndependent contractors earned slightly less than traditional workers, while temp workers and on-call workers made significantly less money. Demographics play a role here, since temp and on-call workers are more likely to be African-American and Latino. Temp workers are also younger than the workforce overall.\n\nEven though they earn less, however, independent contractors overwhelmingly love their jobs, with more than 4 in 5 saying they preferred it to a different arrangement. Most temps, on the other hand, would rather have a traditional job.\n\ncon\n\nThese figures suggest that for some workers -- particularly those with specialized and in-demand skill sets, who also tend to be older -- independent work really is one path to a more satisfying life. That's the line that many independent work platforms have been pushing for some time.\n\nAs full-time employees, we tend to build our personal lives around holes and gaps that are left by our professional lives, said Kasriel. For freelancers, it's the opposite.\n\nBut labor advocates note that work satisfaction isn't incompatible with traditional employment. Full-time freelancers who eschew nine-to-five employment are often giving up much more than a portion of their pay.\n\nIndependent contractors don't have the right to a minimum wage, overtime or breaks, said Maya Pinto, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project. They can be subject to discrimination based on age, race, gender or disability; they don't have the right to organize or the right to a safe and healthy workplace, or workers' compensation or unemployment benefits, and they bear the full cost of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt's true, workers want flexibility, she added. But they also want basic security and the right to health care and retirement, and they shouldn't be forced to choose.
Los Angeles -- Teachers overwhelmingly approved a new contract Tuesday and planned to return to the classroom after a six-day strike over funding and staffing in the nation's second-largest school district.\n\nAlthough all votes hadn't been counted, preliminary figures showed that a vast supermajority of some 30,000 educators voted in favor of the tentative deal, therefore ending the strike and heading back to schools tomorrow, said Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, accompanied by leaders of the union and the Los Angeles Unified School District, announced the agreement at City Hall a few hours after a 21-hour bargaining session ended before dawn.\n\nThis is a good agreement. It is a historic agreement, Garcetti said.\n\nThe deal was broadly described by officials at the news conference as including a 6 percent pay hike and a commitment to reduce class sizes over four years.\n\nEducators, parents, students, and supporters of the Los Angeles teachers strike wave and cheer in Grand Park on January 22, 2019 in downtown L.A. at rally after tentative deal ending six-day strike was announced it Scott Heins / Getty Images\n\nSpecifics provided later by the district and the union included the addition of more than 600 nursing positions over the next three school years. Additional counselors and librarians were also part of the increase in support staff.\n\nMarianne O'Brien said the need for additional support staff was one of the main reasons she walked picket lines.\n\nThis is not just for teachers. It's also for counselors, nurses, psychologists and social workers, said O'Brien, who teaches 10th grade English.\n\nThe new contract also eliminates a longstanding clause that gave the district authority over class sizes, officials said. Grades 4 through 12 would be reduced by one student during each of the next two school years and two pupils in 2021-22.\n\nClashes over pay, class sizes and support-staff levels in the district with 640,000 students led to its first strike in 30 years and prompted the staffing of classrooms with substitute teachers and administrators.\n\nThe district maintained that the union's demands could bankrupt the school system, which is projecting a half-billion-dollar deficit this budget year and has billions obligated for pension payments and health coverage for retired teachers.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Austin Beutner said he was delighted the deal was reached. But he stressed that financial challenges remained.\n\nThe issue has always been: How do we pay for it? Beutner said. That issue does not go away now that we have a contract. We can't solve 40 years of underinvestment in public education in just one week or just one contract.\n\nUnder the tentative agreement, the district, the union and the mayor's office will work jointly to advocate for increased county and state funding for Los Angeles schools, according to the UTLA summary.\n\nThe Board of Education was expected to move quickly to ratify the deal, which would expire at the end of June 2022.\n\nCBS Los Angeles points out that the accord calls on the district to support a statewide cap on charter schools and provide regular reports on proposed co-locations of charter and public school campuses. The pact also calls on Garcetti to support a ballot initiative going to voters in November 2020 that would roll back Proposition 13 property tax limits on commercial buildings to increase state tax revenue for public education.\n\nWe have seen over the last few weeks the way that the city has rallied around public education, and quite frankly it's been breathtaking; it's been inspiring to see, Garcetti said agt the news conference, CBS L.A. notes.\n\nThe deal came as teachers in Denver voted to go on strike as soon as next Monday. More than 5,000 educators would be affected. The main sticking point is increasing base pay and lessening teachers' reliance on one-time bonuses for having students with high test scores or working in a high-poverty school.\n\nIn Oakland, California, some teachers called in sick last week as part of an unofficial rally over their contract negotiations, which also hinge partly on a demand for smaller class sizes.\n\nThousands of boisterous educators, many wearing red, and their supporters gathered on the steps outside City Hall where the tentative agreement was announced.\n\nThe crowd began cheering, blowing horns and chanting the initials of Caputo-Pearl as the smiling union leader emerged from the building and walked through the throng.\n\nJoaquin Flores, a special education teacher, said he believed he would support the deal unless it weakened health care or didn't go far enough to reduce class size.\n\nIt's almost like metaphoric, Flores said. The sun's out. When we started, it was all rainy and cold. I feel like it's a new day.\n\nTeachers hoped to build on the Red4Ed movement that began last year in West Virginia and moved to Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state. It spread from conservative states with right to work laws that limit the ability to strike to the more liberal West Coast with strong unions.\n\nCBS L.A. says the LAUSD covers 710 square miles and has 1,322 schools, although 216 are independent charter schools, most of which were being staffed with non-union teachers and were unaffected by the strike.
ATHENS, Greece -Greece and its bailout creditors on Tuesday suspended talks on the country's austerity program until next week, after a new set of marathon overnight negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nFinance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the meetings in Athens would resume April 18, with an aim to reaching an agreement by April 22, when he is due to meet with his peers from the 19-country eurozone.\n\nHe said both Greece and its creditors -- other European countries and the International Monetary Fund -- agreed that some progress has been made.\n\nThe new pause in the talks, which were originally scheduled for completion last October, will allow officials participating in the negotiations to attend an IMF meeting in Washington this week.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili voiced optimism that an agreement can be found in time. It is in the interest of all the parties involved, she said.\n\nGreece's left-led government is hoping to conclude the talks as soon as possible because that would allow the beginning of negotiations with creditors on easing the country's crippling debt load.\n\nThe main sticking points are creditors' demands for cuts in pensions under a sweeping reform package designed to keep the tottering system alive, plus tax reform and the degree of protection accorded to individuals and companies struggling to repay their bank loans.\n\nThe country has depended on rescue loans since 2010 and signed up to a third bailout last summer after the government ditched its anti-bailout policies to prevent a disastrous Greek exit from the eurozone.\n\nGerovassili insisted that Greece would honor its bailout commitments, but she accused the IMF of dragging its feet during the negotiations.\n\nThe Labor Ministry said agreement or significant progress has been achieved on the proposed pension reforms, insisting that there will be no reductions in basic pensions. It also said Tuesday that its proposals for a core national pension of 384 euros ($438) have been accepted.
IRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nIRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nIRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nA week into tax season, the U.S.' tax collector appears woefully behind its own projections on processing tax returns and refunds.\n\nAccording to the agency's own numbers from last November, the IRS expected to process 1.2 million electronic tax refunds and 300,000 paper refunds during its fourth working week of the year, from Friday, Jan. 18 to Thursday, Jan. 24. The following Friday-to-Thursday week, it expected to process a total of 4.3 million refunds.\n\nWhile the IRS is able to accept and process tax returns before the official opening of tax season (Jan. 28 this year), it's not able to accept large numbers of electronic returns before then, which is the filing format preferred by nearly 90 percent of taxpayers.\n\nThe IRS' November projections show it processing 1.2 million electronic refunds by Jan. 24 — a number that now appears highly unlikely, since electronic filing did not officially open until Jan. 28.\n\nAn agency spokesman said the IRS had started processing some returns in January, but did not have data on how many had been filed or processed to date.\n\nThe IRS is also coming off a 35-day shutdown that saw just a fraction of its workforce show up. The agency has said it will be doing everything it can to have a smooth tax season and minimize the impact on taxpayers, but it has also canceled three days' worth of Tax Court sessions over larger tax cases, and left open the possibility of canceling more.\n\nIt's likely there will be at least a week's delay from what taxpayers are used to, Jeanie Ahn, senior reporter for Yahoo Finance, told CBS News recently. Everyone is bracing for the most chaotic tax season in three decades, she said.\n\nLast year, 18 million tax returns were filed by the first week of filing season, which ended Feb. 2. A spokesman for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc., the country's No. 2 tax-prep company, said the number of January filers was much lower than typical this year, a drop he attributed to the effect of the government shutdown.\n\nSince 2010, the IRS has faced every tax season with fewer and fewer staff. This year, just over 70,000 permanent agency employees are on hand for a projected 155 million tax returns.
A semi-abandoned town in Italy is selling homes for just over $1 in hopes of luring foreigners to renovate the properties and revive its local economy.\n\nSambuca, a hilltop town in Sicily with sweeping views of the Mediterranean, is selling dozens of bargain basement-priced homes after other Italian towns and villages have made similar offers. Sambuca -- no relation to the liqueur of the same name -- has a population of fewer than 6,000 residents and is located about 40 miles south of Palermo.\n\nGangi, also in Sicily, started selling vacant homes for €1 in 2015, and Ollolai, in Sardinia, followed suit. At the heart of those efforts are attempts to revive their economies and preserve their cultures as young residents flocked to big cities and older inhabitants passed away, leaving a stock of abandoned homes in their wake.\n\nHome-rental company Airbnb is also offering to pay four foreigners to spend three months in Grottole, located in the southern province of Matera, through its Italian Sabbatical program. Participants will help the local community revitalize the village.\n\nThe small village of Grottole, with only 300 inhabitants and more than 600 empty homes, is at risk of disappearing and is asking for your help! the program's description reads.\n\nAn aging population\n\nItaly's birth rate has been trending downward for years. The Italians a few years ago set records for having the lowest birth rate recorded in history, at 1.1 children, said Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute.\n\nHe said he's witnessed a number of initiatives aimed at encouraging procreation, none of which have been effective.\n\nThere are villages and towns where they are offering bonuses for every child born there because the birth rate is so low, he said. But there seems to be no combination -- around the world -- of economic incentives, at least in developed countries, to bring the birth rate up to be replacement, which would be 2.1 children, he said. I don't know if there is anything Italy can do.\n\nYounger residents of Sambuca have moved to urban environments, while its elderly inhabitants generally are not equipped to maintain a modern economy.\n\nOlder populations don't innovate and invest for the future, they just draw down resources they have already accumulated, Mosher said. Some countries have years of inventory of homes that may never be occupied again because there simply aren't people to occupy them. It's a drag on the economy.\n\nThousands of emails\n\nBut global interest in the newly listed Sambucan homes suggests the tactic is already working.\n\nIt's amazing I have had thousands of people expressing interest all the way from Dubai, Barcelona, and I have had tons of requests from New York, Giuseppe Cacioppo, Sambuca's deputy mayor and tourist councilor, told CBS MoneyWatch. He said he hasn't come up for air since the international community got word of the deal after CNN initially wrote about the plan.\n\nI didn't sleep last night because I was getting so many phone calls, he said. I received 39,000 emails in response to the offer, including people who want to buy whole blocks of houses.\n\nStrings attached\n\nThe homes -- which cost less than a slice of pizza -- are enticing, but do come with strings attached.\n\nBuyers must make a €5,000 (or $5,682) security deposit and commit to spending upwards of €15,000 (about $17,000) to revamp them within three years. The security deposit will be returned once the renovations are complete, CNN reported.\n\nPotential homebuyers should also come armed with a plan to keep themselves busy.\n\nThese places are small and very skewed toward older generations. Life is very quiet and simple and basic. There wouldn't be much to do beyond renovating your property and gardening, said Kathleen Peddicord, publisher and founder of Live and Invest Overseas.\n\nAnd fluency in Italian is a must, according to travel and retirement experts.\n\nYou definitely need to be comfortable in Italian if you are going to undertake any kind of labor project, said Kat Kalashian, editor of Live and Invest Overseas. You will need to speak Italian to get referrals and find labor, and you will need to speak Italian to work with them.\n\nProperty taxes\n\nBuyers can avoid paying property tax on the homes if Sambuca becomes their principal residence. Otherwise, a tax rate of up to 0.76 percent applies. A secondary tax, that varies across municipalities, also applies, in the range of zero to 3.3 percent. You could have zero point zero taxes depending on the municipality, Kalashian said.\n\nMax Dilendorf, a New York-based attorney who last year responded to a similar initiative, ultimately decided the offer didn't make sense after weighing the cost of a gut renovation against renting.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are only going to end up being there once or twice a year, I think you are better off just getting an Airbnb, he said. But if someone is willing to relocate and live there, maybe it does make sense.\n\nPeddicord agrees that while it's a unique opportunity, it's not for everyone.\n\nIt would mostly be a labor of love and a life adventure. These properties really make sense for someone who is in love with the romantic idea of it, she said.
The White House's top budget official, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, talked up the administration's plans for a simpler tax code while introducing the budget Tuesday, predicting such a change would help shrink the country's tax gap.\n\nSo, what is the tax gap?\n\nThe tax gap, simply put, is the amount in taxes individuals and companies owe the government, but that the government never receives. There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion.\n\nAlmost enough to close the deficit that year, Mulvaney said. And we don't assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform.\n\nMulvaney said there are two reasons for the tax gap -- people either don't want to pay, which is always a problem, or filing out the form is just too hard. It's not easy to make headway into that first problem, Mulvaney conceded, but that second reason has a solution.\n\nIf you can really fill out your tax reform -- tax returns on a single piece of paper, you're much more likely to actually do it, Mulvaney added.\n\nHowever, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nMulvaney thinks a simpler tax code will help close the gap-- he reasons that one of the biggest reasons people don't pay taxes is that they don't want to or are unsure how. Much of the White House's pitch for tax cuts hinges not necessarily on cuts, but on how the plan -- still in a preliminary stage -- would make filing taxes simpler for the average American.\n\nIt's not that easy to get rid of it, Goldwein said. In fact I should say, it's impossible to get rid of it. It's not that easy to reduce it.\n\nSimplifying the tax code reduces an incentive to underreport and makes it easier to report the correct numbers, but no one approach or combination of approaches will eliminate the gap, Goldwein said.\n\nGAO, which analyzed the tax gap problem in 2012, pointed out that simplifying the tax code is only one way to help close the gap. GAO said the IRS also needs to improve customer service lines for taxpayers, devote additional resources to enforcement, expand compliance checks before issuing refunds and modernize information systems, among other things, to address the gap.\n\nThere's not some magic way to get an entire half a trillion dollars a year, Goldwein said.\n\nBut if the Trump administration managed to do what previous administrations have been unable to do and closed the tax gap with a one-approach solution, what would that more than $400 billion cover?\n\nThe answer is, quite a lot. That $486 billion represents more than 10 percent of the White House's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget. For instance, it would easily cover the proposed 2018 Medicaid budget of $408 billion, a good chunk of the proposed $600 billion defense budget, or much of the proposed $582 billion Medicare budget.\n\nThat would be huge, if somehow we could get that, we would have barely any budget deficit this year, Goldwein said.\n\nBut that's also kind of a fantasy, Goldwein added. That's kind of the equivalent of saying, what if we eliminate all government waste, fraud and abuse?
The House passed President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday morning almost entirely along partisan lines. The bill now goes the Senate, although it included a minimum wage hike that the Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday cannot be included if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.\n\nTwo Democrats, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jared Golden of Maine, voted with the Republicans in the 219-212 vote. Not one Republican voted for the bill.\n\nDebate on the bill went until nearly 1 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nThe bill, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in direct checks for Americans making under $75,000, a $400 per week supplemental unemployment bonus, money for vaccine distribution, and funding to aid schools and state and local governments.\n\nAlthough previous coronavirus relief bills have passed with bipartisan support, the bill had been expected to pass in the House along party lines, as Republicans have criticized the high price tag and the inclusion of provisions they see as unrelated to the crisis.\n\nThe vote in the House came days after the U.S. passed the grim milestone of 500,000 American deaths from the coronavirus. Millions have lost their jobs due to the economic fallout, and supplemental unemployment assistance established by Congress late last year is set to expire in mid-March.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan is broadly popular among Americans, earning support from Republican voters as well as Democrats and independents. A poll by Morning Consult/Politico released on Thursday shows that 76% of Americans support the package, including 60% of Republicans.\n\nThe need is great. The opportunity is there, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe bill also includes a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill could not include an increase of the federal minimum wage if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.\n\nCongressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance, so the budget reconciliation process allows Democrats — who hold a 50-seat majority — to pass the bill without any Republican votes.\n\nThere are strict rules for utilizing the budget reconciliation process, such as the Byrd rule, which requires that all provisions in the bill be budget-related, and must not increase the federal deficit after a 10-year budget window. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that the minimum wage hike did not fit the parameters for budget reconciliation.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Pelosi said MacDonough's decision was disappointing.\n\nHouse Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan on the Floor tomorrow, Pelosi said. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not been increased since 2009.\n\nHowever, it's unclear that the provision raising the minimum wage would have been included in the final bill even if MacDonough had ruled that it was possible to include a wage hike in the bill. At least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, had expressed concerns about raising the minimum wage. Without support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the bill's prospects would be doomed.\n\nOnce the Senate considers its version of the bill, progressives in the House could threaten to withhold their support for the final package unless some kind of minimum wage hike is included. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested on Thursday that progressive members of the House should pressure their own party in ways similar to conservative Democrats in the Senate.\n\nThere are progressive Democrats that have that muscle in the House, Ocasio-Cortez said. If we as a party decide to stand down on our promise of elevating the minimum wage, I think that's extraordinarily spurious and it's something that as a party we could have a further conversation about how to fight for it.\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the Senate should consider eliminating the legislative filibuster, which would allow any legislation to pass in the Senate with a simple majority. Using budget reconciliation is a work-around that allows lawmakers to approve bills with a simple majority without torpedoing the filibuster.\n\nThe rules in the Senate have been really put there to preserve the power of the minority, Jayapal said. Now we have to show that it's going to make a difference that we're not going to get caught up in the tyranny of the minority that exists in the Senate.\n\nJayapal and other progressives have pushed for Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule the decision of the parliamentarian in her capacity as president of the Senate.\n\nA senior Democratic aide confirmed to CBS News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to add a new provision to penalize large corporations that don't pay their workers at least a $15 minimum wage, an idea which appears to be gaining traction.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee and an outspoken advocate for raising the minimum wage, said Thursday that he would introduce an amendment to the package to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.\n\nThat amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill, Sanders said.\n\nOther senators appear to be open to punishing corporations for not paying their workers sufficient wages. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden suggested a plan B approach to the minimum wage in a statement on Friday, which would impose a 5 percent penalty on a big corporations' total payroll if any workers earn less than a certain amount.\n\nAt the same time, I want to incentivize the smallest of small businesses-those with middle-class owners-to raise their workers' wages. My plan would provide an income tax credit equal to 25 percent of wages, up to $10,000 per year per employer, to small businesses that pay their workers higher wages, Wyden said.\n\nRepublican Senator Josh Hawley, who joined Sanders in calling for $2,000 direct checks late last year, also introduced a bill that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour.\n\nAmendments only require a simple majority to be added to legislation, so an amendment on the minimum wage is possible as long as all 50 Democrats approve.\n\nRaising the minimum wage is widely popular, with a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026 which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election.\n\nJack Turman contributed to this report
LAS VEGAS - What happens in Las Vegas could have a ripple effect across the country if 50,000 casino-hotel workers employed at more than 30 of the city's world-famous resorts go on strike at any time starting next week.\n\nIf members of the union that includes hotel and food workers don't show up to work, it could cost the destination millions and lead to travel woes for anyone taking a vacation or business trip to Sin City. It could also send casinos looking for temporary workers amid low unemployment rates.\n\nAnalysts declined Wednesday to weigh in on the financial impact that a strike could have on casino operators. But the casinos and hotels aren't the only ones that would feel the squeeze. Local and state governments stand to lose millions from the impact on tourism.\n\nThe last time casino-hotel workers went on strike across Las Vegas was in 1984. That job action lasted 67 days and cost workers and the city more than $1 million a day each in lost wages and revenues, not counting gambling losses. The price could be much higher this time if the two sides can't reach agreements: The city has 90,000 more hotel rooms and gets an additional 29 million visitors a year than it did in 1984. More than 42.2 million people visited Vegas last year.\n\nStatistics from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority show visitation did not decline overall in 1984, with about 12.8 million traveling to this desert oasis. The agency on Wednesday said it's monitoring the situation but wouldn't say whether it expects visitation to decrease in the event of a strike.\n\nDavid Fiorenza, who teaches urban economics at Villanova University, said local and state governments will start to notice a hit to their sales tax revenue if the strike lingers. And if hotel stays decrease, less revenue will come in from the local hotel tax.\n\nFiorenza doesn't expect an immediate impact on the number of people visiting Las Vegas if a strike happens, but it will affect bookings if it lasts more than a few days.\n\nPeople who already booked to go out there are not going to cancel, he said.\n\nBut the strike is a lingering worry for those still planning summer vacations.\n\nWhat happens during the summer in Las Vegas is you get a lot of people who are traveling. They say 'We're going to visit family in California, and then we'll go on a trip to Las Vegas,' said Michael McCall, a Michigan State University professor of hospitality business. This would deter them. That's going to shut down everything.\n\nThe contracts of 50,000 members of the Culinary Union who work at 34 different casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas are set to expire at midnight May 31. Half of those workers cast ballots Tuesday, a majority of whom authorized a strike at any time starting June 1. Individual casino operating companies and the union have failed to reach agreements through negotiations that began in February.\n\nUnion officials say workers want to increase wages, protect job security against the increasing use of technology at hotel-casinos and strengthen language against sexual harassment.\n\nMGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) operate more than half the properties that a strike would affect. Both companies have said they expect to reach agreements with the union.\n\nHowever, Fiorenza said major casinos have contingency plans, and he expects them to find ways to continue operating if a strike does happen, such as using managers in front-line jobs and bringing in workers from outside the area.\n\nOperators that have casino-hotels in other states likely have begun sending notices to some workers at those properties to draw them to Las Vegas temporarily, McCall said. It would be hard to hire short-term replacement workers locally because unemployment is low in Las Vegas.\n\nEric Brasure of Newark, Delaware, is planning a trip to Las Vegas to attend a Star Trek convention in the summer. He said he supports the union, and on Wednesday retweeted on his podcast's account a list of the hotel-casinos that would be affected by the strike.\n\nI fully intend to support the strike by not patronizing any casino where workers are striking, Brasure said in a Twitter message.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the union last voted for a strike in 2002, but it reached a deal before employees walked out.
The Internal Revenue Service expects taxpayers to pay their taxes on time — and it also holds itself accountable for sending out late tax refunds. Last year, the agency sent out $3 billion in interest to taxpayers whose refunds were delayed, up 50% from the prior year.\n\nThat's according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which assessed the IRS' performance last year during the coronavirus pandemic and outlined some risks to the 2021 tax season. The reason for the surge in interest payments due to late refunds is tied to the coronavirus outbreak, which caused a backlog of paper tax returns and prompted the IRS to delay the tax filing season by three months.\n\nIn a response to the findings, the IRS pointed to the delay in the tax filing deadline as one reason for the increase in interest payments. The agency must issue refunds within a 45-day window after the April 15 filing date, or else it owes interest on the refund. But the delay in the tax deadline meant the IRS had to pay interest going back to that April 15 filing date even though it had given taxpayers more time to file.\n\nToo much paper\n\nThe report also highlighted another factor: a pileup in paper returns that IRS personnel struggled to process after the pandemic shut down its offices and workers shifted to remote work.\n\nIRS' overall 2020 performance was significantly impacted by its reliance on manual processes such as for paper returns, and its limited ability to process returns remotely while processing centers were closed, the GAO report said. As a result, as of December 2020, IRS had a significant backlog of unprocessed returns and taxpayer correspondence.\n\nWhile the GAO highlighted the challenges of the pandemic as a culprit in the surge in interest payments, it pointed out that the IRS has been paying out more in interest payments on late refunds for several years prior to the pandemic. That's likely to increase for the current tax season until IRS addresses its backlog of unprocessed and suspended returns, the GAO added.\n\nIRS backlog\n\nTaxpayers aren't exactly getting rich from the IRS interest payments on late refunds, given that the agency's interest rate is 3%. The average amount of interest paid to taxpayers for late refunds was $18, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe IRS is still digging out from a backlog of tax returns filed last year, when the agency shifted its workers to remote work and stored paper tax returns in trailers until it could get to them. The backlog of unprocessed returns from last year still numbers in the millions.\n\nAccording to IRS officials, when IRS staff returned to work at processing centers, they resumed opening mail on a first in, first out basis — opening mail with the earliest received date, the GAO report noted. At the end of the filing season, IRS' mail backlog was significant — a volume of nearly 8 million — with IRS returns processing staff opening mail received months prior.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 individual returns are filed electronically, but the GAO found that more than 20% of businesses filed paper returns even though they could have e-filed, which is a faster option because processing is automated.\n\nIndeed, the IRS — which was still processing 6.7 million returns at the end of January — has advice for taxpayers in the current tax season: Use e-file.\n\nThere is no doubt this is the year to file electronically, Ken Corbin, the new chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said last month. Taxpayers who file paper returns need to prepare for a lengthy potential wait.
The House passed a coronavirus relief bill shortly after midnight on Saturday following lengthy negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The bill passed on a bipartisan basis with President Trump's endorsement.\n\nIt will be considered by the Senate next week, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cautioned that Republican senators will have to thoroughly read the 110-page bill before bringing it to a vote.\n\nThe package addresses the potentially devastating economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, including measures on free testing and paid sick leave.\n\nHere's what's included in the legislation:\n\nFree coronavirus testing: Federal health providers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers, are required to provide free testing.\n\nFederal health providers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers, are required to provide free testing.

The package also provides funding for state waivers to pay for meals for children who normally receive them at school.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Senior Nutrition Program will receive supplemental funding to assist Americans affected by the virus. The package also provides funding for state waivers to pay for meals for children who normally receive them at school. Emergency family and sick leave: Employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees and government staffers may take up to 12 weeks of protected family and medical leave, including two weeks at full pay, with any additional weeks taken with no less than two-thirds of the employee's usual pay, to either quarantine or seek preventative care. Small and mid-sized businesses would receive tax credits to pay for medical and family leave of up to 100% of the wages they pay out. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required to provide two weeks of sick leave at full pay for employees who are seeking treatment for the virus. Self-employed individuals would also receive tax credits to receive paid leave.

As the coronavirus promises to strain the nation's supply chains, top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says he's delivering an executive action to President Trump intended to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and bring that manufacturing to the U.S.\n\nWhat I can speak to is this broader, interesting issue of how dependent the United States of America is on the global supply chain, not just for its medicines but for its medical supplies and medical equipment, Navarro told CNBC's Squawk Box Monday, as stocks plummeted amid the worsening economic impact of the virus.\n\nNavarro, in a recent interview with CBS News, said the impending executive action he has been working on would tighten domestic procurement by requiring federal agencies looking to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to Buy American. The medical supply chain has been a concern — face masks and other necessary medical equipment are made in China, where this strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated. Navarro is also pushing for a payroll tax cut to address the country's worsening economic outlook, an initiative that Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for, despite pushback from bipartisan lawmakers.\n\nThe executive action consists of a three-pronged strategy that includes the Buy American piece, streamlining regulations to allow for a quicker approval process for domestic products, and incentivizing new technologies. The goal of the order is to have a robust domestic production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment on U.S. soil, Navarro said.\n\nThe best way to ensure adequate investment is to provide a stable, strong, long-term demand domestically for these products, Navarro said.\n\nThe Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans Affairs Departments would be most affected by the possible change. Navarro argues the coronavirus crisis highlights that the U.S. is dangerously dependent on numerous nations for medicines, supplies and equipment, roughly 15 to 20 countries, not just China. The top trade adviser said the previous administration wasted numerous opportunities to address this in the face of crises that underscored this dependence, such as during the H1N1, SARS and MERS crises.\n\nThis executive order would target essential medicines and medical countermeasures— not just pharmaceuticals, but supplies and equipment needed to deal with emerging infectious diseases, as well as medical products and the supply chains that feed into those two categories, according to Navarro.\n\nEssential medicines refers to the over 400 medicines the World Health Organization has identified as essential for any nation to have. Medical countermeasures are products that the United States has identified to fight five threats: chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear, (CBRN), and emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19. This includes medicines, supplies such as face masks and gloves, and medical equipment like ventilators.\n\nThe executive action is expected soon — Navarro says it will be done in Trump time, meaning as soon as possible.\n\nThis president wants to bring our jobs home. This is especially important when our national defense and public health are at risk, Navarro said.\n\nPrashant Yadav, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development whose expertise is in global health supply chains, said such a possible executive order comes down to how it's implemented. The pharmaceutical industry should be encouraged to increase their resilience, meaning they should be encouraged to have more bandwidth to manufacture drugs on U.S. soil.\n\nWe need to build resilience into the supply chain, undoubtedly, Yadav said.\n\nPharmaceutical and medical supply companies should be required to demonstrate to the Food and Drug Administration that they're working towards building more resilience into the supply chain, he said. Resilience in practical terms means ensuring companies have at least two suppliers, sourcing for instance 50% of their products from New Jersey and 50% from China, he said.\n\nThe manufacturing of medicine and medical supplies is highly concentrated in China not necessarily because the cost of labor is cheaper, as many might think, but because of the availability of subsidies, the lower cost of capital, better access to utilities, and lower environmental standards, he said.\n\nIt's not the cleanest manufacturing industry, Yadav said, pointing to stricter environmental regulations in Europe and in the U.S.\n\nNow, the greatest supply chain concern for the U.S. lies in the future: will the U.S. be able to deliver all the pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment the U.S. will need? Whatever production capacity there is now in the U.S. and in Europe, Yadav said he has less confidence in whether that capacity will remain available over the next few months, as workers at manufacturers may not be able to go to work.\n\nVentilators in particular are a concern, since orders for them at health care facilities will increase as the Coronavirus continues to spread. The Trump administration has been unable to say how many ventilators it thinks the country will need in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nOverall ventilator capacity and what we need in Europe or the orders that will keep coming in from Italy and France, orders from within the U.S. ... they will all aggregate up to quite a high number, which may be more than the current capacity of existing manufacturers, Yadav said. So we might have to think about bringing on board new manufacturers who might not be certified or approved to sell medical equipment in the United States, but we might have to think about how we bring them on board.\n\nYadav said the U.S. should also consider giving companies that produce ventilators a guarantee that if they overproduce ventilators months from now, the federal government will purchase them, or purchase them and allocate them to developing countries hit by the pandemic later in the year.\n\nThat brings me to another point, which is, in such a scarce capacity scenario, we also worry about the limited supply is going to be sucked up by what we need in the U.S. and what we need in Europe, and in such a scenario, what happens to a country in Africa which is also ... trying to buy ventilators, Yadav said.
With tax season officially starting on Friday, millions of Americans could be in for a shock: owing taxes on unemployment benefits they received in 2020. The federal government and most states consider jobless aid taxable income. But unlike a paycheck, taxes typically aren't automatically deducted from such benefits, with the IRS expecting its cut.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates people could end up owing as much as $50 billion in taxes on unemployment insurance benefits they got last year — as layoffs soared during the coronavirus pandemic — come the April 15 tax filing deadline. That could wipe out many taxpayers' refunds and even dent the economy.\n\nThese surprise tax bills would reduce tax refunds or possibly even require net tax payments for vulnerable households, which may force some to cut back on spending, analysts with the investment bank wrote in a report.\n\nFor now, the Internal Revenue Service is not considering extending the April 15 deadline or waiving penalties for Americans who find they underpaid taxes throughout the year, Ken Corbin, chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said on a call Thursday.\n\nCongress could still ride to the rescue. Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to exempt unemployment benefits from taxes, with worker advocates noting that taxing unemployment assistance undercuts the purpose of the payments.\n\nIn the meantime, workers can make their own calculations to see if they'll owe money. Unemployment benefits are subject only to federal income tax paid at income-tax rates (not Social Security or Medicare taxes that are taken out of employer paychecks.) People living in states without an income tax or in select states that don't tax such benefits — including Alabama, California, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia — don't need to worry, said Robbin Caruso, a partner in the tax practice at Prager Metis.\n\nRead on to learn about other ways doing your taxes might differ this year.\n\nMoved for work? You may owe in multiple states\n\nMillions of Americans who started working from home or relocated to a different state during the pandemic may find themselves owing state tax in multiple locations.\n\nMany millions of taxpayers will have more complexity this year — they'll have to file in two states, Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, told CBS MoneyWatch. A smaller number may experience actual double taxation.\n\nDuring the health crisis, and even as Americans started working remotely, employers continued to send taxes to the states they normally did — without adjusting for workers' new location.\n\nA number of states also have what are called tax convenience laws, under which the state collects taxes from workers based on the location of their employer, regardless of whether someone commutes to the office. Typically, a worker's state of residence will provide a credit for taxes paid to another state so that an individual doesn't get taxed twice on the same income.\n\nIf you moved permanently or temporarily last year — especially if you spent more than 180 days in a new state — it may be advisable to consult an accountant to figure out what tax applies to you. Double taxation could cost a lot.\n\nSomeone subject to this should basically think of a doubling of their state income tax liability, or potentially more, Walczak said.\n\nHome office expenses and deductions\n\nMany workers who've spent the last year with their office in their living room may be wondering if they can deduct the costs of setting up a home workspace.\n\nUnfortunately, unless you have a business, you can't, said Alicia Jegede, a CPA in Brooklyn, New York, and founder of New Gen Financial Planning.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act barred workers from deducting unreimbursed work expenses — anything from news subscriptions to business travel to union dues — from their income. Jegede suggests that anyone who spent money on their work-from-home set up ask if their employer can reimburse the cost. The business can deduct it, but the employee can't, she noted.\n\nThere's one exception to this rule: Independent contractors and small business owners can deduct home office costs from their business income. To qualify for the tax break, the workspace must be exclusively and regularly used as a place of business, Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax, told the Associated Press. That means working from the dining room table doesn't qualify.\n\nSelf-employment costs\n\nWorkers who turned to the gig economy to make ends meet in 2020 could find themselves owing a lot more in taxes. For one, their payroll tax would be double what a regular employee owes — 15.3% on any income up to $137,000. This is separate from federal income tax.\n\nAs a result, gig workers and freelancers should make sure they're deducting all their business costs. Any money spent on work cuts into business profits — that includes equipment, office supplies, advertising or marketing-startup costs, or costs for a dedicated home office.\n\nGig workers for a delivery company should make sure to claim all the mileage they are eligible for, as well as costs for car maintenance, vehicle supplies or washing, which are eligible expenses.\n\nAbove-the-line deductions\n\nTaxpayers can deduct $300 worth of charitable donations this year, even if they don't itemize their deductions. The IRS estimates that about nine in 10 taxpayers now take the standard deduction instead of itemizing.\n\nTeachers can deduct $250 spent on teaching supplies from their income, provided their employer didn't reimburse those costs. That includes personal protective equipment.\n\nEarned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit\n\n\n\nTaxpayers used to claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is worth between $538 and $6,660 depending on income and number of children, can continue to do so — with a twist. Taxpayers who had big income changes in 2020 can use their income from 2019 to qualify for the credit. The same is true for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which is worth up to $2,000 per child.\n\nNormally, a taxpayer's income in the prior year will determine if they can claim the EITC. But the credit typically applies only to money earned from work. Unemployment benefits, though they are subject to federal income tax, don't count as earned benefits for the purposes of the EITC or CTC.\n\nWith many unemployed workers potentially facing a smaller credit this year or even owing taxes, Congress adjusted the eligibility criteria for the EITC and CTC as part of a December pandemic relief package, allowing taxpayers to use their 2019 income to qualify for these credits.\n\nThese are considered the two most valuable tax credits for low- and moderate-income working families. A family of four earning up to $53,000 can claim the EITC, while the CTC is applicable to families making as much as $400,000.\n\nThose expecting to claim either credit should be prepared to wait a little longer to get their refund, as the law requires the IRS to hold these refunds as it verifies claimants' qualifications to prevent fraud.\n\n\n\nFor taxpayers who file immediately, the refunds should land in bank accounts by the first week of March if there are no other issues, Corbin said.\n\nNo tax on your stimulus check — or that PPP loan\n\nAnd now for some good news: Americans don't have to pay federal taxes on any of the Economic Impact Payments the government has distributed as coronavirus relief.\n\nIt's a tax credit, basically, and it's a refundable credit, Caruso said. That means a person whose income is low enough could potentially owe no taxes and still qualify for a stimulus check.\n\nEligibility for the full stimulus payment last year included an income of $75,000 or less for a single person and $150,000 or less for a married couple; people who earned above those amounts may have qualified for a reduced payment. If you fell within the income brackets but didn't get a payment, you'll want to claim it on your tax return. If you earned too much to qualify based on 2019 but your 2020 income was lower, filing your tax return will allow you to get a payment based on your 2020 income. And if you had a child last year, you'll qualify for a back payment of $500 or $600 (or potentially both) if you haven't already received the dependent payment.\n\nSmall business owners whose Payment Protection Program loans were forgiven are also exempt from income tax on the value of the forgiven loan.\n\nUnlimited business losses\n\nWith many businesses last year losing money and even closing, Congress has increased the amount of losses a business owner can use to offset their income.\n\nWe're expecting more people to have business losses. Before, you could deduct up to $250,000 [in losses] for single people. Now you can deduct an unlimited amount, Jegede said.\n\nIf you had a large business loss but no other income last year, you could potentially wind up owing no taxes. A taxpayer could even use a large loss from 2020 to offset income for prior years, potentially getting tax refunds for, say, 2019 or 2018, said Robert Caplan, a partner at Caplan & Wong CPAs in San Mateo, California.\n\nNot only will their taxes go down this year, but also for five prior years, he said.\n\nInvesting gains — or losses\n\n\n\nMany people jumped into the stock market for the first time in 2020 — that might entail new tax obligations.\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that you only pay taxes on investments when you realize their gains. So if you bought a stock in 2020 and its value went up, you won't pay taxes on those gains until you sell. And if it sank in value, the same rules of realizing apply. Investment losses hurt, but you can use them to offset your gains, up to a limit.\n\nIt's also important to understand that gains are taxed differently depending on how long you held on to the investment. If you sell a stock you held for less than a year, it is taxed at the higher short-term capital gains rate, versus the lower long-term capital gains rate for investments held for more than a year.\n\nHigher-income households may also face a net investment income tax on capital gains and other investment income.\n\nMade a killing on GameStop shares? That won't come up until 2021 taxes, which aren't due until next year. But it would be wise start making plans or anticipated payments on those taxes now.\n\nAimee Picchi and the Associated Press contributed reporting.
JERUSALEM -- The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem reopened early on Wednesday after Israeli officials suspended a plan to impose taxes on church properties in the holy city. The iconic church, revered by Christians as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, had been closed for three days to protest the Israeli tax plan.\n\nFather Sinisa, a Franciscan cleric, said that clergymen from various Christian denominations had continued their prayer routines inside the church throughout the closure, but he said the public must also be able to visit.\n\nIt's important to reopen the doors of the Church, to let the people who sometimes come once in their life to visit this holy place, he said. Because a holy place without people is nothing ... only the stones.\n\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said his decision had affected only commercial properties, such as hotels, restaurants and offices, and not houses of worship. He said other cities follow similar practices worldwide.\n\n\n\nBut angry religious leaders say their non-church properties provide valuable services for pilgrims and their local flocks, and fund important services like schools and health clinics.\n\nThey also accused Barkat of surprising them with the order and violating longstanding understandings with the churches. Barkat's office claimed the churches have debts of roughly $185 million.\n\nThe closure of the church raised tensions with the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, as well as smaller denominations, weeks ahead of the busy Easter season.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said a professional team, including representatives from the Jerusalem municipality as well as government ministries, was being established to negotiate with church officials to formulate a solution.\n\nIsrael also suspended legislation in parliament that would govern sales of church sales to private developers.
In 2020, Corvain Cooper was featured in the BET documentary titled Smoke: Marijuana + Black America. In a telephone interview from a maximum-security prison in Louisiana, the 41-year-old Cooper detailed his sentence.\n\nI'm serving a life sentence for marijuana, money laundering and tax evasion for a non-violent crime, Cooper said in the documentary.\n\nA year later, Cooper is free and at home, finally able to hug daughters, Scotlyn,15, and Cleer, 11, after spending nearly eight years in prison.\n\nI see my daughters and I finally got to tell 'em, you know, I'm sorry. Your dad's sorry. I had chose the wrong road...in trying to provide for you guys...And it took me away from you guys. ... I'm sorry for missing everything that I've missed, Cooper told CBS This Morning national correspondent Jericka Duncan exclusively.\n\nIt's been a long couple of years for Cooper and his family. He reflected on how his time behind bars impacted his daughter and his family.\n\nThe pain that I have caused on my kids and on my dad and on my mom and on my family and on my loved ones and the pain that I caused on myself, he said. When he was arrested in 2013, Cooper said he hadn't sold marijuana in at least four years.\n\nI had a clothing store, it was like a boutique....it was called SC clothing named after my kids Scotlyn and Cleer. I had their faces on the side of the wall, he said in the BET documentary.\n\nCooper was convicted for his involvement in trafficking marijuana from California to North Carolina. He was sentenced under the now widely-criticized 1994 federal crime bill's three-strikes rule.\n\nHe had two previous non-violent convictions; which were both later vacated. But because of those two convictions, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his third conviction.\n\nI'm watching rapists get out and my brother is in prison facing life without the possibility of parole, Cooper's sister, Shqunda, said. Things have changed. You know what I mean? And he's not there all because of marijuana? And then it's legal here. So it makes it even worse.\n\nCalifornia legalized cannabis in 2017. Cooper said in the BET documentary that growing up in California, his children often saw marijuana dispensaries.\n\nMy kids have to roll by every day by living in California and they have to see more dispensaries than they can even see liquor stores. The clothing store that I built from the ground up, that I put my kids' faces on, had all events in the neighborhood, finally to make my dream come true turned into a dispensary...to change the clothing store to a weed store, he said.\n\nWhile the nation has been decriminalizing marijuana possession and its use over the last decade, relief for Cooper didn't come until the very last day of Donald Trump's presidency when he granted Cooper and at least 11 others clemency.\n\nHis life sentence was just one of 143 cases that received commutation during Mr. Trump's last weeks in the White House. Of the people who had their sentences commuted, at least 12 were serving lengthy time for non-violent drug-related crimes. Cooper detailed to Duncan what his final day of prison was like.n\n\nSo I am in a cell for about an hour and then they come to the door and say, 'Pack it up, you got five minutes to get out of here. You just got immediately released.' And I just break down, he said.\n\nWow. Just like that, Duncan said,\n\nJust like that...I made my first call and I called my mom. And she said—I'm crying uncontrollably. But she says, 'What are you crying for? Ivanka Trump called me at 12:30 and said that you that you're coming home, Cooper recalled.\n\nHe spent his homecoming spending time with his daughters—who were happy to have their dad home.\n\nIt's like to have my dad home; it's like a relief. Like it's like, I was when he was in jail, it was like I was missing a part of him. It's like a piece of me is back, his daughter, Cleer, said.\n\nIt was like memories lost. Like, I would see my friends have their dad there and they would pick them up and I didn't have that memory with my dad, his daughter, Scotlyn, said.\n\nCooper is now a dad determined to set an example by growing a message of hope.\n\nHow do you save someone like yourself at that time? Duncan asked.\n\nThe first thing I wanna tell them is they get to see the results. They get to see what actually happened to me. I got a life sentence, Cooper said. And I wanna show them the stuff that they're chasing is all fools' gold.\n\nCooper started a website selling clothing and also advocating for companies that legally sell marijuana. He called the BET documentary pivotal to raising awareness about his story and so many others. BET is a division of Viacom CBS.
Shoppers at Wegmans Food Markets across New York are no longer carting their groceries home in plastic bags. Starting Monday, the grocery chain is ditching single-use plastic bags, with a statewide ban set to take effect March 1 in the Empire State.\n\nThose who don't bring or buy their own reusable sacks can pay five cents apiece for paper bags, with any profits donated to local food pantries, according to the 101-store Wegmans chain, which also operates in neighboring Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts as well as Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nAcross its chain, Wegmans found that reusable bags account for only a fifth of all bags used. But a test Wegmans conducted in two stores in New York state found that customers opted to bring reusable bags when the company imposed a small fee for paper bags.\n\nOn average today, 20% of the bags used across all Wegmans stores are reusable. However, at our pilot stores in Corning and Ithaca, we've flipped that statistic so that only 20% of the bags used are single-use bags, according to Jason Wadsworth, Wegmans packaging and sustainability manager.\n\nThat said, the grocery chain has no immediate intention to remove plastic bags from its stores outside New York, with a spokesperson emailing CBS MoneyWatch: We don't have specific plans to remove them from stores in other states. However, we will continue to focus on helping our customers shift to reusable bags.\n\nOther supermarket chains are also moving away from plastic bags as more cities and states ban them. Plastic bags are considered especially bad for the environment as they are made with petroleum and don't decompose.\n\nWalmart, the planet's largest retailer, last April began offering reusable bags at the checkout counters in U.S. stores. Kroger, the nation's biggest grocery chain, in May said it would eliminate plastic bags by 2025.\n\nNew York is among more than half a dozen states to ban plastic grocery bags; others include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine and Oregon.\n\nAlready complying with bag bans in several Massachusetts communities since 2014, Big Y Foods in August shelved plastic checkout bags at its more than 80 supermarkets across the state and in Connecticut, with the latter state enacting a 10-cent tax on disposable plastic bags.\n\nStop & Shop also dropped plastic bags, but only at its 91 stores in Connecticut. It also operates another 300-plus stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey.
Health Savings Accounts feature prominently in the new health care bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives, with a variety of changes in store.\n\nBut research shows not many participants are actually saving money beyond the initial tax break.\n\nMore than 20 million Americans currently have these accounts, which allow people with high-deductible health plans - above $1,300 for an individual or $2,600 for a family - to put aside money for out-of-pocket medical expenses and save leftover funds for future expenses.\n\nContrary to Flexible Spending Accounts, in which you put aside pre-tax dollars and have to spend it all in a year or lose it, there is no yearly expiration for HSAs. The account is yours for good.\n\nYou get a tax break for your contributions, and if you earn interest or investment growth on your account, that is also tax-free as long as you use the money for qualified expenses.\n\nThese accounts have sky-rocketed in the last six years, with 85 percent of the accounts opened since 2011, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI.\n\nNew research shows how people are using them, which may shed some light on the best way to make changes.\n\nThe most prominent takeaway is that there is not actually that much saving beyond the tax break in Health Savings Accounts. Money goes in and comes right back out, with only a fraction held over.\n\nHere are some other key points analysts have learned:\n\nEmployer contributions matter. Want to encourage people to put aside money for their medical expenses? Have an employer start the kitty.\n\nThe average employer contribution to workplace HSAs is $868, with the average employee contributing $1,786, for a combined yearly total of $2,654.\n\nIn accounts not associated with a workplace, the average contribution was $1,713, according to Devenir, an HSA research consultant.\n\nAny minimal employer contribution - even just $500 - and you've essentially given them the jump start, said Steve Christenson, executive vice president at Ascensus, a retirement and savings plan provider. When you say 'here are dollars to start with and here's some additional information on how to keep funding it' - those two simple things go a long way.\n\nNot even close to the max. Among the propositions of the new health care bill is raising the maximum contribution allowed to HSAs, which this year was capped at $3,400 for an individual and $6,750 for a family. The bill proposes to raise that ceiling to be equal to the out-of-pocket maximum for high-deductible plans, which is $6,550 for individuals and $13,100 for families.\n\nWhat we know from current behavior is that just 15 percent contribute the maximum, according to Devenir. More than 30 percent do not contribute any money at all in a given year.\n\nShrinking savings. Most HSAs are churn accounts, and saving might actually be going down instead of up. Devenir's latest report found participants holding over less in 2016, just $5.7 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in 2015 and $6.2 billion in 2014.\n\nA HelloWallet study from 2015 found that nearly 30 percent of HSA participants spent nearly all they contributed in a year.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, as you still get a tax deduction for the contribution, said Paul Fronstin, director of Health Research and Education for EBRI.\n\nLosing to inflation. Most of the $37 billion in HSA accounts is sitting in cash, with only $5.5 billion invested in any way, according to Devinir. EBRI's study found that investments made up only about 3 percent of the total deposits. In today's low interest-rate environment, that means these accounts are not keeping up with inflation, and actually losing value over time.\n\nIf you think you're going to spend most of the funds, it doesn't make sense to invest it, said Evan Powers, a certified financial planner with Cypress Financial Planning in Charlottesville, Virginia, and an adviser for myfinancialanswers.com.\n\nThose who are saving and investing are doing better - they have an average balance of $14,971, seven times larger than those who do not invest.\n\nThe missing component is consumer education, said Ascensus' Christenson.
Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns or has a stake in over 70 businesses such as Coca Cola, IBM, and American Express. But this is no ordinary billionaire. He's giving 99 percent of his wealth to charity and he thinks rich people should pay higher taxes.\n\nPerson to Person take you to where Buffett's mega deals are done. His private office in Omaha, Neb., is as unconventional as the man himself.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, Lara -- I'm glad to have you here at world headquarters. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Why Omaha for you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, you know, I was born here. I've always been happy here. II've lived various other places -- Washington D.C., New York. ...It's home. And I live five minutes from here. I've lived in the same house for 53 years. I've been in this building for 50 years. My car just automatically drives back and forth (LAUGHS). If I try to take it anyplace else, it won't go.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: So no desire to have lots of, a lot of mansions around the world, a big boat -- all those things that your wealth would allow you to do?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I have every possession I want. I have a lot of friends who have a lot more possessions. But in some cases, I feel the possession possess them, rather than the other way around.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There are some references to the University of Nebraska there, the Big Red. Does that football team mean something?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It -- means a lot. Means everything. It -- in Nebraska, when there's a div -- when there's a divorce, the husband says, you know, You can have the kids, I want the tickets. (LAUGHS) ...Yeah, come on and look around a little here. (CHUCKLES)\n\nHere's a Nebraska helmet signed by Tom Osborne and a number of the top players. I've -- I've been red-shirted myself now for 61 years. But I'm ready to go when the need arises.\n\nLARA LOGAN: I see there's a sign that you were pointing to there above your -- your hallway.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- if you leave the Notre Dame locker room, there's a sign, you know, Play like a champion today, and -- and all the players touch that as they go out on the field. And I figure, with Notre Dame's record, you know, (LAUGHS) who I am -- who am I not...to argue with that? ...We just touch this every morning when we come in and hope for the best. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Take us into the hallway.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Let's go around, and we'll look at that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: My goodness, look at this.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: We have all kinds of things here... Let's start with some of the sports material. Here's Ted Williams in his first game as a Red Sox player against Holy Cross.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What do you admire about Ted Williams?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Ted Williams described in his book, The Science of Hitting, that the most important thing -- for a hitter -- is to wait for the right pitch. And that's -- exactly the philosophy I have about investing...Wait for the right pitch, yeah, and... wait for the right deal. And it will come... It's the key to investing.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Is that Tiger Woods I see?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: This is Tiger Woods over -- I caddied for him some years ago down at Isleworth. He was a terrific -- he's a terrific student. I mean he -- (CHUCKLES) picked up all kinds of things from the tips I gave him as I caddied. And...\n\nLARA LOGAN: Were you any good as a caddy?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say that based on the size of the tip, no. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: Can you take us into your office, Warren?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK, let's take a look.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Wow, that's very nice.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It's a nice office. It's perfect. I've been -- I'll be happy here the rest of my life. It -- you know, it -- it is home to me. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: How long have you been making deals from here?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, I've been making deals from this building for -- for 50 years. ...and I love this building and wonderful landlord. And -- they keep the rent down for me. (LAUGHS) Well, I'm a happy guy here.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Over your left shoulder, I see a picture of your father.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, my dad. That's his campaign picture in 1942. He was 39 years of age then. And he ran for Congress. ...And that picture comes from his campaign card. ...he went on to -- have a few more terms.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You said to me once, Warren, that he was your hero.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Absolutely. Absolutely. I never saw my dad do anything as -- in his entire life that -- you wouldn't...feel good about being on the front page of the paper. And -- I mean he was, in every respect. He gave me unconditional love. He was -- supported everything I did. He was a terrific human being.\n\nThis is his desk right here, from, I don't know, 75 or more years ago. And my sister, older sister, Doris, found this little train that used to be on his desk when we were little kids...she had kept it...having found it, she gave it to me.\n\nLARA LOGAN: There's no computer that we can see on your desk. Is there, does that really mean you have no computer in your office at all?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Not in my office. I'm working on the abacus now. And if I get that mastered we'll go to the multiplication tables.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There's hope for you yet. ...The phone seems to be the principle instrument there.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. It's - it - it -- it is the principle instrument, that, and -- and the pile of reading material ... it's just a question of kind of gathering facts, which come in mostly via print, and then thinking about 'em. And if -- if I can make one good decision a year, you know, we'll do OK.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Well, take the IBM investment which you recently made. I mean it is said...you were reading the annual report, and you saw opportunity there to invest in a company because you saw potential.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Charlie, I'd been reading IBM's annual report, literally, every year for 50 years. And then this year...I saw something that sort a clicked in terms of adding to my-- feeling of confidence. And -- so we spent $10-plus billion. (CLEARS THROAT)\n\nLARA LOGAN: What would you say most investors do wrong?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, they-- they-- think that what is important is next quarter's earnings. And they think they have to trade around, and they have to read news events and change their opinion ...And if people would...adopt the philosophy that they're buying something to hold for the rest of their life. ...they can't go wrong doing that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What are the other photographs in this room that -- that represent something (CLEARS THROAT) important to you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well -- they almost all represent something important. I mean over here -- is my -- certificate from the Dale Carnegie course I took when I was 21. (CHUCKLES) I was terrified of public speaking. I -- oh, I couldn't do it. I couldn't get in front of a crowd and give 'ya my name. (CHUCKLES)\n\n...And finally, I spent 100 bucks...And I took this course. And not only did I get so I could talk in front of people, you know, I can't stop talking in front of people. (LAUGHS) -- and during-- during that class, I should mention, Charlie, I proposed to my wife during that. So -- if I didn't get my $100 worth (LAUGHS) from that class. And--\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You also had received the Medal of Freedom from President Obama in 2010. Is that in this office?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It's right here. I feel very good about that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What does the inscription say?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- it goes on and on. But it -- (LAUGHS) it -- it says some-- it says some nice things-- Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Modesty -- modesty becomes you. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: This is the baseball you were talking about.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Willie Mays. We've got...Ted Williams, we got Joe DiMaggio all on the same baseball.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Wow.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Where'd you get that?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, a friend gave it to me. And - and -- and it's got -- you know, it's got a bunch of my boyhood heroes, and they're still my heroes -- on there.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: The New York Post and other newspapers were full of your recent visit to New York, and...you were seen and photographed with Jay-Z.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: That -- that is true. And Jay-Z had been out here about a year ago. And what I did was I admired his tie about six times. I said, Boy, that is a good (LAUGHS) looking tie, Jay. And (CLEARS THROAT) finally he said, OK, you win, Warren. And he took it off and he gave it to me. (CHUCKLES)\n\nSo I thought if I went to this opening -- I wore his -- the tie he gave me. And then, when I saw him, I started looking at his tie. And I said, You know, Jay, that is one good looking tie. And he said, Warren, he said, forget it, you only get one. (LAUGHS) ...but he is a very smart guy. And he's financially smart.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Here are my children here. Here's Peter and Susie probably giving me little advice at the annual meeting. And that's my son, Howard, over there.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There's also a picture among the board of directors of Bill Gates. And you have become...obviously, well known because of -- of the commitment to philanthropy and -- and giving -- $30 billion or more to Bill to -- as part of his foundation. That grew out of what?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it grew out of the fact that, when I was in my 20s, my wife and I decided, after we took care of ourselves and our family reasonably well, that we would probably have a lot of money left over. And the original idea was that I would pile it up, and then some day, she'd unpile it -- (LAUGHS) for philanthropy.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: But...I expected that she would outlive me, and she died in 2004. So I had to come up with another plan to take care of what would be -- now amounted to a very large sum of money, which I wanted to go back to society. ...I go to somebody that's better at it than I am.\n\nAnd you've got not only Bill and Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation, but you've got my three children, and I've left them-- or I'm giving them significant amounts for their foundations. ...And I feel very good about it.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You know, there's a lot of talk about America, and whether America's in decline. We've had -- the president mentioned it in his State of the Union address. You feel good and optimistic about America and its future?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: (CHUCKLES) Charlie, America's not in decline. I mean I was born in 1930, just imagine that you had foreseen 25 percent unemployment, 4,000 banks closing, the Dow going, from the day I was born, from 250 down to 42? I mean all kinds of things, a world war coming on. But this country, it moves ahead.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There is one thing that's come up. It's fairness. And you have been making the point...that it wasn't exactly fair for you to be paying at a lower tax rate than your secretary. ...There is also the -- now the Buffett Rule. Explain to us what the Buffett Rule is.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It encompasses the idea that people who are extremely rich, who have benefited enormously from this society, should have a tax rate...that's at least as high as the people that work for them. And the people of this office averaged 36 percent.\n\nMy figure was 17 percent. So clearly-- something is out of whack. And, you know, nobody's gonna pay more than is required. Mitt Romney doesn't, I don't, you know. ...And, incidentally, I don't fault M -- Governor Romney at all. He paid what -- the Congress told him to. ...we were promised that a rising tide would lift all boats. A rising tide has lifted all yachts.\n\nIf you're gonna talk about shared sacrifice -- we have not had an ounce of shared sacrifice from the very rich.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: When you look at the future, your own future -- are there things that you want to accomplish? Are there goals that still are there for you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I'm doing what I love, Charlie. I -- I've got great news for you, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Yeah?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: When you're 81, you're (LAUGHS) gonna have more fun than you're having now. I mean 81 is a great year. (LAUGHS) I look forward to doing what I do ... I forget whether it was Mel Ott, when he was playing for the Giants or somebody, said, You know, they -- you mean they pay me for this? (LAUGHS) That's the way I feel.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Warren, thank you very much. This been a remarkable visit.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Thank you very much.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Thanks for joining me.\n\n(CHUCKLES) And Charlie, be sure -- be sure, if this is gonna be on with George Clooney (CHUCKLE), be sure you keep explaining to your viewers which one of us is which, because he gets called Warren a lot.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Oh, does he really?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: And - and -- and your viewers are gonna get very confused about which one of us you're interviewing unless you make it perfectly clear. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: We'll do our best. We - we -- we're basically saying that -- that these are the two sexiest men in America today. So that's sort of --\n\nLARA LOGAN: Yeah.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: -- the way we're pitching this.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I think that's the way to do it. And I think saying the two is the best way to do it, because you wouldn't want him to feel bad if you're writing this, right? (LAUGHS). Thanks to both of you.\n\nBuffett turns to leave and walks back towards his office.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Thank you very much. Warren. Great to see you ...\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Go back to work.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK (LAUGHS).
WASHINGTON—Borrowing a word from Democrats, a new White House report says changes made to the Affordable Care Act under President Trump didn't amount to sabotage.\n\nDue out Friday, the report from the Council of Economic Advisers says Obama-era subsidies that help low- and middle-income customers pay their premiums will keep HealthCare.gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of Trump's changes. Nearly 90 percent of customers get taxpayer-provided assistance.\n\nThe report looks at three big changes under Mr. Trump that affect former President Barack Obama's health care law. They are congressional repeal of the law's unpopular fines on people who go uninsured, association health plans for small businesses that can be marketed across state lines, and low-cost short-term health insurance that doesn't have to cover pre-existing conditions or basic benefits like prescription drugs.\n\nThese reforms do not 'sabotage' the ACA but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax-funded care to those in need, the report says. The council is a White House agency that advises the president.\n\nLarry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said less regulation isn't automatically an act of sabotage, but Mr. Trump has made clear his hostility to Obamacare.\n\nThe president seemed to take pride in undermining the ACA, but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law, said Levitt, who reviewed the report for AP. They can point to benefits of deregulation, but will also have to live with the costs, which include higher premiums for middle-class people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe report comes as House Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are moving to shore up the ACA, including trying to undo some of Trump's insurance changes. Although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government, there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. Restoring the ad budget for HealthCare.gov slashed by Mr. Trump is also a possibility.\n\nDemocratic White House hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue, with some pushing for a government-run system that would cover all Americans and replace Obamacare.\n\nAbout 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the ACA's subsidized markets, or exchanges, and another 12 million are covered by its Medicaid expansion. The GOP's drive to repeal the ACA in 2017 fell flat, and Democrats effectively blocked another try by gaining control of the House.\n\nCasey Mulligan, chief economist for the White House council, said it turns out that the penalty for people going uninsured wasn't really essential for the Obama health law to function. The subsidies were more important.\n\nRemoving the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars, give families more choice, without destabilizing the exchanges, he said.\n\nThe report didn't address constitutional arguments in a Texas court case against the ACA brought by red-state officials. But its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured. A federal district court judge agreed, and that ruling is on appeal. The Justice Department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow the White House report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law. Officials at the Council of Economic Advisers said they're not policymakers or lawyers, but economists.\n\nThe report also claims $450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options, reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies, and the cancelled fines. But it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle- and upper-income consumers.\n\nKaiser Foundation analyst Levitt said $450 billion seems high to him.
LOS ANGELES -- Johnny Depp sued his former business managers on Friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame.\n\nDepp's lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against The Management Group seeks more than $25 million, alleging its owners failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorized loans and overpaid for security and other services.\n\nMichael J. Kump, an attorney for The Management Group, calls Depp's lawsuit a fabrication and wrote in a statement that Depp never alleged any wrongdoing. The company did everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending, Kump wrote.\n\nDepp's lawsuit accuses the company and its owners, attorneys Joel and Robert Mandel, of receiving $28 million in payments for their services over the roughly 16 years they managed his finances. The company actively concealed the true state of Mr. Depp's finances while driving him deeper and deeper into financial distress, the lawsuit states.\n\nDepp hired the Mandels in 1999 and their compensation was not subject to a written contract, his lawsuit states. It states they received 5 percent of his income on hit films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and other major releases, including Alice in Wonderland and the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nIt alleges the company failed to file Depp's tax returns on time, costing him nearly $5.7 million in penalties. The lawsuit also alleges the company overpaid for several services, including forgetting to terminate the lease on a home where Depp's mother lived temporarily, and spending $8 million on security between 2012 and 2015 alone.\n\nDepp learned of the problems after hiring a new management company in March 2016, the complaint states.\n\nKump wrote that Depp owes The Management Group $4.2 million from a $5 million loan they provided the actor. His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised, Kump wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit came on the same day Depp finalized his divorce from actress Amber Heard. Their divorce judgment calls for the actor to pay his ex-wife $7 million in installments -- which she has earmarked for two charities -- while allowing him to keep numerous properties and vehicles.\n\nDepp isn't the only blockbuster star to take his former managers to court alleging mismanagement. Nicolas Cage sued his former business manager seeking $20 million for alleged mismanagement in 2009 and the manager in a countersuit cited the actor's spending for his financial troubles. The case was resolved before trial.
It's tax time — here's when to expect your refund The IRS started processing tax returns this week. Here's when to look for your refund.
CALERA, Ala. -- Kathleen Dawn West described herself as a full-time wife and mom on Facebook but lived another life on other social media platforms, calling herself an exhibitionist and posting risque photos with a chance for subscribers to see sexier images for $15.99 a month.\n\nWest, 42, was found dead outside her home near Birmingham, and authorities are now faced with a question: Did West's online activities play a role in her death?\n\nPolice have classified West's death as a homicide, but they haven't said how she died. What appears to be the remainder of a blood stain darkens the asphalt across the street from the two-story brick home she shared with her husband and middle school-age daughter.\n\nNo charges had been filed by Friday, six days after she died. But the mysterious nature of West's death - she was found dead early Saturday in the quiet bedroom community of Calera, a town of 14,000 people about 35 miles south of Birmingham - has people buzzing.\n\nAt least two Facebook groups with more than 2,200 members total have been created to discuss the case, and neighbors are concerned in West's subdivision, where homes are still under construction.\n\nIt's shocking that it happened so close to home, so all you can do is worry and think about your family, and that's all I've been doing, Xavier Lee, who lives two door down, told CBS affiliate WIAT-TV.\n\nWord of West's death was met with sadness at the gym where she worked out until dropping her membership a few months ago.\n\nShe'd come in, do her thing and leave. She kind of kept to herself, said Austin Lockhart, owner of Fit 24 Calera. She'd wave and smile. She was a nice lady.\n\nOn Facebook, West posted lots of selfies and commenters often mentioned her attractiveness. But there were also photos of her wedding to longtime husband William Jeffrey West and images of West and her daughter playing in the snow last month.\n\nBut West, a Florida native with blonde hair and a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, seemed like a different person on other online accounts.\n\nWith a personal description that included exhibitionist, West had a private Instagram account with nearly 52,000 followers that linked to a paid site that featured adult content and naughty fun. Some of the images were included on a site for mature hotties.\n\nSimilar content was posted on Twitter, where West's presence began March 2016.\n\nInitially, West just tweeted links to a site where she sold clothing items, including dresses, coats, shoes and kid's clothing. The feed took a sharp turn Aug. 11, when she tweeted: Happy Frisky Friday - Let's get this party started, with a link to the pay-per-view site. The description included a link to a wish list page where viewers could purchase lingerie for her.\n\nThe posts continued until the morning before her death, when West tweeted a link to sell a women's wool jacket. A few days earlier, she had posted a lingerie photo showing her bare buttocks that linked to her adult site.\n\nIn Calera, neighbors don't know what to think about West's slaying.\n\nThis child doesn't have their mother anymore. Don't know why, don't know what happened, that led up to the incident, but to wake up to that news, it makes you think, Lee said.\n\nThat's the sad thing about it, another neighbor told WIAT-TV. You've got a little girl that's not gonna have her mother anymore.\n\nFederal court records show West and her husband filed for bankruptcy in 2007 while living in Cartersville, Georgia, but the case appeared to be handled routinely and closed within months. Tax records indicate they moved into the home in Calera in 2015. It was valued at $169,000 last year.
Some Senate Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to overhaul the nation's approach to handing out stimulus payments, the direct financial relief deployed by Congress to help millions of Americans affected by the economic collapse that followed the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead of providing discrete rounds of stimulus checks that are negotiated each time and arrive months apart, the federal government should provide recurring checks to help families get by until COVID-19 is over, the 10 lawmakers said in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\nThe request comes as the Senate takes up Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package this week, which would include a third round of stimulus checks that would direct $1,400 to millions of eligible Americans. Congress distributed $1,200 checks a year ago under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and sent an additional $600 payment in December as part of a broader stimulus bill. The senators didn't specify an amount they are seeking for monthly direct aid.\n\nThe idea of issuing recurring stimulus payments as a way to speed up the economic recovery has been championed by progressives and some Democrats. In January, more than 50 House members urged the Biden administration to back a proposal for $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic ends.\n\nSupporters of the idea point out that financial hardship remains widespread around the U.S. almost a full year after COVID-19 effectively shuttered the economy. Despite the ongoing recovery, a third of adults are struggling to pay their bills, while employers have slashed roughly 10 million jobs from their payrolls during the crisis, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe decades of research on stimulus checks back up the argument that much of this is spent, which helps stimulate the economy, and sources like the Census show there is immense need for more funding despite the fitful recovery, said Claudia Sahm, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nShe added, The reason we aren't in the 1933 world when things were really bad is because the federal government and Federal Reserve stepped in — but we aren't out of the woods yet.\n\nThe senators who signed the letter, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, argue that aid such as enhanced unemployment benefits hasn't reached every family hurt by the economic crunch.\n\nMillions do not qualify for unemployment insurance after seeing their hours reduced, switching to lower-paying jobs, or temporarily leaving the workforce to care for family members during the pandemic, they wrote in the letter. Direct payments are crucial for supporting struggling families who aren't reached by unemployment insurance.\n\n$1,400 pushback?\n\nStill, such arguments are unlikely to gain traction among congressional Republicans and even some moderate Democrats given that many have already voiced opposition to the $1,400 checks that are part of Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan. Some lawmakers have also called for the the third round of stimulus checks to be distributed to fewer households by focusing on lower-income Americans.\n\nUnder the American Rescue Plan, a person's income is the chief determinant of whether they'll get a check, as well as the payment amount — similar to the previous two rounds of stimulus checks.\n\nSingle people could receive as much as $1,400 each, while married couples filing jointly could receive $2,800. Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. For incomes above those thresholds, payment amounts would decline, phasing out completely for single individuals earning above $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $200,000.\n\nSome lawmakers have cited research that shows higher-income families are rebounding well from the pandemic's economic impact, as a rationale for lowering those income thresholds. Given that debate, many lawmakers are unlikely to support recurring stimulus payments.\n\nEven so, some elements of the American Rescue Plan could provide a similar form of ongoing relief to some households. First, it would direct an extra $400 per week to unemployed Americans, up from $300, which would be helpful to jobless workers and their families but wouldn't help those who are struggling with cut hours or other income losses.\n\nThe bill also would expand the Child Tax Credit and transform it from an annual break claimed on tax returns — and which typically shows up in people's annual refunds — into a monthly payment. Under the plan, the tax credit would rise from $2,000 to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and to $3,000 for children up to age 17. The IRS would pay the tax credit in monthly installments. That means that a family with two children under 6 could receive monthly checks of $600 from the IRS, for example.\n\nIn making their argument, the senators noted that the $1,400 isn't likely to tide many families over for very long.\n\nFamilies shouldn't have to worry about whether they'll have enough money to pay for essentials in the months ahead as the country continues to fight a global pandemic, they wrote. Almost six in 10 people say the $1,400 payments set to be included in the rescue package will last them less than three months.
Parenthood isn't cheap. But come tax time, parents and guardians of kids can take advantage of a number of tax savings that aren't available to the general public.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit is the best-known of these, since it doubled in size recently with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. But parents can also take advantage of tax perks for some child-care expenses — including for adult kids.\n\nChild Tax Credit\n\nThis tax credit can reduce your liability up to $2,000 per child. It can also give you back up to $1,400 even if you had no tax liability, making it one of the most valuable tax credits.\n\nSome 22 million households, or about 1 in 7 taxpayers, claimed the Child Tax Credit in 2017, the most recent year for which IRS data are available. The figure last was likely much higher, since the late-2017 tax law changes more than doubled the maximum income someone could earn and still qualify for the credit.\n\nThe IRS lists seven criteria for a child to be eligible for the credit:\n\nThe child needs to be a U.S. citizen or legal resident\n\n\n\nShe should be no older than 16 at the end of the tax year\n\nThe child needs to be your child, foster child, sister or brother, or a descendant of one of them (such as a niece, nephew or grandchild)\n\nYou need to claim the child as a dependent on your tax return\n\nThe child cannot provide more than half her own living expenses\n\nThe child can't file a tax return as part of a married couple\n\nThe child should have lived with you for more than half the year\n\nThe residency requirement is structured so that a single child can't be claimed by more than one taxpayer for a given year. But its complexity can lead to confusion, especially in multi-generational households, said Nina Olson, founder of the Taxpayer Rights Center and the National Taxpayer Advocate from 2001 to 2019.\n\nBecause of the dynamics of the American family, children move back and forth between separated parents; they may be living with grandparents; they may be living with unmarried parents, Olson told CBS News.\n\nIf you're just caring for a child and it's your cousin, that's not necessarily going to qualify you for the tax credit, she explained. That's where you really get into people claiming something that maybe makes sense, but doesn't qualify under the law.\n\nWhat about divorce?\n\nIf you have one situation that can cause problems, it's children of divorced parents, said Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct. Sometimes they may not understand who should be claiming what child, and it causes some complexities.\n\nA divorce decree will usually spell out who can claim the child, but individual families can make decisions differently, Jaeger notes. Sometimes parents will alternate years, with one claiming the child tax credit in odd years, and the other claiming them in even years. Or, if two children are involved, one parent can claim each child.\n\nStill, it's not always foolproof.\n\nI've had situations in my practice where I've had parents come in and complain to me that, even though they're legally entitled to claim a child on their tax return, their former partner has claimed the child and gotten extra tax refunds, said Jonathan Medows, a CPA based in Manhattan. It created a fight with the IRS to get their refunds.\n\nFor that reason, Medows tell clients claiming the credit to file as early as possible.\n\nIf your dependent is 17 or older\n\nChildren who are 17 or older won't qualify you for the full Child Tax Credit, but you can get up to $500 per person through a dependent care credit. You can claim an adult child or an aging parent, for instance — as long as that person meets the IRS' definition of a dependent.\n\nChild-care costs\n\nIn addition to the Child Tax Credit, working parents can deduct some of the cost of child care. If you paid someone to care for your kids so that you could work or look for work, you likely qualify. The deduction limit is $3,000 for a single child, or $6,000 for two or more children.\n\nA quick reminder of the difference between tax credits and tax deductions: Credit reduces the amount you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar, making them generally more valuable than deductions. A deduction reduces the amount of your income on which you have to pay taxes, so its value to you will depend on what tax bracket you fall into.
Walter Jones, a 13-term Republican congressman from North Carolina who made a name for himself by becoming an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq after initially supporting the invasion, died Sunday afternoon, his office announced. He died on his 76th birthday.\n\nIn a statement, his office praised Jones as a man of the people and a champion of the men and women serving in the military.\n\nCongressman Jones will long be remembered for his honesty, faith and integrity. He was never afraid to take a principled stand. He was known for his independence, and widely admired across the political spectrum, the office wrote Sunday night. Some may not have agreed with him, but all recognized that he did what he thought was right.\n\nJones, whose health had deteriorated after he fell and broke his hip, had been in hospice care since late January.\n\nRep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, poses for a portrait in his office on Capitol Hill, on Wed., Oct. 25, 2017, in Washington. AP\n\nAfter initially running for a North Carolina congressional seat as a Democrat in 1992, Jones was first elected to Congress in 1994 during the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich. Although he was a reliable Republican vote for most of his nearly 24-year tenure, Jones gained notoriety for sometimes breaking with his party. Most recently, he did not support the 2017 GOP bill to overhaul the nation's tax system — one of President Trump's few legislative achievements with a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nIn 2002, like most members of his party, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq during the administration of President George W. Bush. But he later expressed deep regret and vowed to atone for his support of the war. About 4,000 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict.\n\nAfter his metamorphosis, Jones became a staunch opponent of U.S. military engagement abroad and took part in bipartisan efforts to curtail the White House's power to deploy troops on foreign soil, including in Syria.
Although tens of millions of U.S. workers stand to benefit from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, roughly as many Americans would not.\n\nThe proposed bill, which the Senate is expected to vote on this week after the House passed similar legislation last weekend, could provide billions of dollars to workers affected by the coronavirus — a key step in propping up an economy that is quickly sliding into recession.\n\nThe measure is a huge, huge first step, said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Millions of people are going to get some paid time off that they would not have otherwise, and employers are getting a big government subsidy.\n\nShe added: People are already starting to take this leave, with or without emergency benefits.\n\nStill, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million Americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. That's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions.\n\nFor now, the bill's status remains fluid. House lawmakers passed a series of corrections to their bill Monday night. In the Senate, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul is reportedly threatening to delay a vote unless lawmakers include additional means of funding the benefits expansion.\n\nMy understanding is changes are being made as we speak, Sarah Jane Glynn, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. Whether that leads to substantive revisions in the bill or minor technical fixes remains to be seen, she added.\n\nWhat the House is proposing\n\nThe House's latest proposed changes to its measure stipulate that:\n\nCompanies would not be compensated for sick days they already provide workers, although they could be reimbursed for health care premiums for employees on emergency sick leave.\n\nThe right to paid-family leave would only apply to parents whose children's school or childcare facility had closed due to the coronavirus.\n\nHealth-care providers and emergency responders — along with workers who had been in quarantine or caring for a family member with the virus — would not be eligible for the additional 10 weeks of paid leave.\n\nIn the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay.\n\nThere is a risk that the Senate could look to make alterations to the House bill, though we expect that the pressure to act rapidly, and the bipartisan nature of the current text, will reduce the likelihood of changes, Height Securities analysts Clayton Allen and Hunter Hammond said in a report.\n\nThe paid sick leave provision — the center of negotiations last week between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — is complicated, according to the analysts. It mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. Government tax credits would offset some of those costs.\n\nThe 500 employee cap likely leaves millions of Americans without the new benefit, Allen and Hammond wrote.\n\nStranding small businesses?\n\nAs it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. For an employer, those credits would materialize when they pay their taxes, which companies typically do quarterly. For self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes.\n\nEither way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. For small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early April — but they wouldn't see any relief until July, when filing quarterly taxes.\n\nFor small business experiencing steep declines in demand now, my fear for some is that is going to mean having to close their doors, Glynn said.\n\nAs now structured, the measure covers workers in businesses with less than 500 employees, which is roughly half of private-sector workers, or 67 million, Glynn said. If you add public sector workers into the mix, a total of 87 million are covered.\n\nOf the 61 million people working for the larger employers that are exempt from the coronavirus relief measure, 11%, or 6.7 million, have zero paid sick days, data show. Most those workers have 7 to 8 paid sick days — not enough to self-quarantine as long as health experts recommend.\n\nThere were earlier versions that would have covered more people, but after extensive lobbying from big business and what conservatives wanted, this is where we ended up, Glynn said.\n\nThe wait for the refundable tax credit is now the number one sticking point, said Romig, while adding that everybody sees we need to do this quickly.\n\nAs she put it: As the crisis spreads it's going to become more evident that this is necessary, that businesses of all sizes will need this, at some point.
Florida's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that a law requiring convicted felons to pay off any fines or fees related to their sentence before being able to vote is fair. The opinion sided with Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who had upheld the Republican-controlled legislatures' decision.\n\nThe issue arose after Florida voters n 2018 overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, that amended the state's constitution to give voting rights to former felons — restoring nearly 1.4 million people's right to vote. Republican lawmakers argued that the bill should be more narrowly defined.\n\nThe specific amendment's wording, all terms of sentence, quickly became a flashpoint in the state. In June 2019, DeSantis signed S.B. 7066, requiring all financial obligations be paid off before a convicted felon can vote.\n\nDeSantis then requested an advisory opinion from the high court over the issue but did not ask them to determine its constitutionality. Instead, the governor confined his request to whether all terms of sentence included legal financial obligations, or LFOs, incurred during a sentence.\n\nThe answer to the Governor's question largely turns on whether 'all terms of sentence' encompasses all obligations or only durational periods, the court wrote in its opinion. We conclude that the phrase, when read and understood in context, plainly refers to obligations and includes 'all' — not some — LFOs imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt.\n\nI am pleased that @FLCourts confirms that Amendment 4 requires fines, fees & restitution be paid to victims before their voting rights may be restored. Voting is a privilege that should not be taken lightly, and I am obligated to faithfully implement Amendment 4 as it is defined. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) January 16, 2020\n\nVoting rights advocates have denounced the court's opinion.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court's decision is disappointing and cuts the 1.4 million people who voters expressly intended to re-enfranchise almost in half, said Nancy Abudu, the Southern Poverty Law Center's deputy legal director. By holding Floridians' right to vote hostage, the Florida Supreme Court is permitting the unconstitutional modern-day poll tax in SB 7066, and redefining an amendment nearly 65 percent of Florida voters approved of in 2018.\n\nA lawsuit filed by voter rights advocacy groups against DeSantis and the Florida Secretary of State over SB 7066 is not affected by the court's opinion, the Tampa Bay Times reported. It remains unclear how the court's opinion will affect felons waiting to register to vote.
President Trump marked the launch of his Evangelicals for Trump coalition at El Rey Jesus Church in Miami Friday, the day after he ordered a deadly strike on Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds military force and one of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic.\n\nSoleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now forever gone, the president said during his speech at the church, adding Soleimani had been plotting attacks but they've been stopped for good.\n\nHe was planning a very major attack, and we got him, the president told a supportive audience.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Mr. Trump addressed reporters, insisting, We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nEvangelicals, particularly white evangelicals, were a critical voting bloc in propelling the thrice-married president who says he's never asked God for forgiveness to the White House in 2016. And the president said he thinks he can improve upon that performance among evangelicals in 2020.\n\nI really do believe we have God on our side. I believe that, I believe that, the president said from the stage.\n\nThe president's speech comes as the commander-in-chief is ensuring his grip on the evangelical vote, after a widely circulated Christianity Today editorial denounced him in December. The day after that editorial ran, the Trump campaign announced the launch of the Evangelicals for Trump coalition in Miami.\n\nWanda Albritton, of Miami Springs, Fla., raises her ams in prayer during a rally for evangelical supporters at the King Jesus International Ministry church, Friday, Jan. 3, 2020, in Miami. Lynne Sladky / AP\n\nThe president appeared to take the critique from one of his strongest voting blocs personally, mocking the magazine, which was founded by Billy Graham, and retweeting supporters of his who also blasted the publication. Mark Galli, the editor in chief whose name was attached to the editorial, is retiring.\n\nAt the coalition launch, Mr. Trump recognized a number of the evangelical leaders who were at the event supporting him, including Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham. The president said that Franklin Graham had a special family and thanked him for having fought very hard for us over the two weeks since the editorial was published.\n\nOn Friday, the president repeated his line that he has been a better president for people of faith than anyone else. He also issued his usual warning that anyone on the radical left who takes the White House will eliminate any policy gains for religious people.\n\nFor America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life, the president told the crowd.\n\nThe president also touted his work in weakening the Johnson Amendment, which has long restricted tax-exempt churches from endorsing or denouncing political candidates.\n\nThe president addressed the recent attack on Jews in New York, condemning anti-Semitism and insisting his administration will continue to stand up for Israel.\n\nMr. Trump has been largely holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort since the Friday before Christmas, making frequent golf outings. While in Florida, the president has been tweeting and retweeting tweets about the impeachment process, which, at this point, is stalled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the articles of impeachment passed by the House to the Senate.\n\nThe Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!), the president tweeted Thursday morning. If this...had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!\n\nFundraising for the Trump campaign remained strong through the impeachment process. The campaign raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nGrace Segers contributed to this report.
For almost two decades, presidents have often sat for interviews airing the Sunday of the Super Bowl. For CBS News, Scott Pelley sat down with then-President Barack Obama before the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, 2013.\n\nCBS also interviewed President George W. Bush in 2004 and President Obama before the Super Bowl in 2010 and 2016.\n\nThis year, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan will sit down with President Donald Trump for his first network television interview since the end of the partial government shutdown.\n\nJAMES BROWN: And welcome back to the Super Bowl today presented by Pizza Hut, as we continue from inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. You know, over the years Super Sunday has become far more than a championship football game. It is now an unofficial American holiday. And with that in mind, it's only fitting that we check in with the nation's first fan.\n\nJoining us now is Scott Pelley, the anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News who is live with President Barack Obama at the White House. Scott?\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Thanks J.B. We're in the Blue Room of the White House. Mr. President, very kind of you to take the time. Thank you very much.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be with you.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: There has been concern about the safety of football at all levels, high school, college, and in the NFL. If you had a son, would you let him play?\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well as I said before, I'd have to think about it. You know, it's hard to say no to a kid when they've got a passion for something. And I've got daughters. They don't have a passion for football. It is a great sport. I am a huge fan. But there is no doubt that some of the concerns that we've learned about when it comes to concussions have to give parents pause. And you know, as I said before, I feel differently about the NFL. These are grown men. They-- they're well compensated. They know the risks that are involved. But as we start thinking about, you know, the pipeline. Pop Warner. High school. College. I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make the sport safer and-- and that means that the game's probably gonna evolve a little bit.\n\nAnd for those of us who we'd like to see a big hit, and enjoy, you know, the rock-em sock-em you know, elements of the game, you know, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated. I know defensive players in the NFL get frustrated now, because some of the changes in the rules. But I do think that we want to make sure that after people have played the game that they're going to be okay. And I'm glad to see that the NFL is starting to take this seriously. I understand that Commissioner Goodell has authorized 30 million dollars to the NIH to help study issues of how we can prevent concussions. But these are serious issues and especially for younger kids, as well as college players who don't make a big-- a big salary playing the sport. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep them safe.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: It was right here in this room, two weeks ago today, that you took the oath of office for the second time to begin your second term so let me ask you about the next four years. You have just raise tax rates on families that make more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and above. Are you through raising tax rates?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well I don't think the issue right now is raising rates. The question is, if we're going to be serious about reducing our deficit, can we combine some smart spending cuts? Because there's still some waste in government. Can we reform our health care programs in particular, because we spend a lot more on health care than every other country does. And we don't get better outcomes. So there's a lot of waste in the system and there are things that we can do to reduce health care costs.\n\nAnd can we close some loopholes and deductions that, folks who are well-connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of, so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop. Can we close some of those loopholes? If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Without raising rates again?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Without raising rates again.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: So I'm not hearing you say, read my lips, no new taxes. You think there is going to have to be additional revenue over the next four years?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so that it doesn't have a huge impact. And as I said, when you look at some of these deductions that certain folks are able to take advantage of, the average person can't take advantage of-- the average person doesn't have access to Cayman Island accounts. The average person doesn't have access to carried interest income where they end up paying a much lower rate on billions of dollars that they've earned.\n\nAnd so we just want to make sure that the whole system is fair. That it's transparent and that we're reducing our deficit in a way that doesn't hamper growth, reduce the kinds of strategies that we need, in order to make sure that we're creating good jobs and a strong middle class.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: American women have fought in many of our wars. Some of them have been killed and wounded in our wars. But the Pentagon just announced a major policy change, opening hundreds of frontline combat jobs to women. Do you have any hesitation as commander-in-chief ordering women into combat?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I don't. And the reason has become because women, as a practical matter, are now in combat. They may not get treated as if they're in combat. But when they're in theater in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are vulnerable. They are wounded. And they've been killed. And they have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction.\n\nAnd you know, I've said before the greatest honor I have as president is being commander-in-chief and I meet extraordinary women in uniform who can do everything that a man can and more.\n\nAnd you know, one of my military aides is about five feet tall. Probably weighs about a hundred pounds. You put a 50 pound pack on her and she can do things that you or me would keel over doing. And so, you know the truth is is that women are serving. They are taking great risks. What we should not do is-- is somehow prevent them from advancing in an institution that we all revere.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Next week the board of the Boy Scouts of America is going to vote on whether to end their national ban on gays in scouting. Should scouting be open to gays?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Why so?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well because I think that, you know, my attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and-- and opportunity the same way everybody else does in every institution and walk of life. And, you know the Scouts are a great institution that are promoting young people and exposing them to, you know, opportunities and-- and leadership that you know will serve people for the rest of their lives. And I think that nobody should be barred for that.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: We found out last week that the economy actually shrank in the last three months of last year. If the federal spending cuts that are on tap for March actually take effect, will that push the country into recession?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't know if it will put-- push the country in a recession. But here's what we know. The reason that the economy shrank a little bit, despite the fact that housing's recovering, manufacturing is gone strong, car sales are up. You know truth is that overall there were a lot of positive signs in the economy. The big problem was defense spending was cut 22 percent. It was the biggest drop in-- in 40 years. And it was very abrupt and it had to do with you know folks being worried about the possible impacts of the fiscal cliff and what goes on here in Washington and what I've said repeatedly is-- you know Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers. It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds.\n\nAnd there is a way for us to solve these budget problems in a responsible way. Through a balanced approach that the vast majority of people agree with. If we do that, there's no reason why we can't have really strong growth in 2013. But you know, we can't have Washington dysfunction getting in the way.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Mr. President thank you for having us in today. I hope you enjoy the game. Enjoy Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: It is gonna be a great game. I got some some wings waiting for me upstairs.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Thank you again sir. J.B. back to you in New Orleans.\n\nJAMES BROWN: All right Scott, and our thanks to President Obama and to Scott Pelley for joining us this afternoon.
He's said it before and he's saying it again. In his widely read annual letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive, emphasized that bonds are risky and that investors should stick with equities—even though they can pose greater risk in the near term.\n\nIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks, Buffett wrote. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\n\nThe billionaire investor offered the recommendations not long after the stock market's biggest single-day drop in more than six years. He also urged investors not to use leverage to invest in stocks, saying it can lead to irrational behavior when times are volatile.\n\nEven if your borrowings are small and your positions aren't immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary, he wrote, adding: An unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n\nBuffett's yearly missive included an explanation of Berkshire's 2017 results, which included the conglomerate tallying a more than $29 billion gain for 2017 due to the tax overhaul passed by Congress late last year. The gain, which was mildly offset by $1.4 billion in taxes paid on repatriated foreign earnings, made up almost two-thirds of Berkshire's $44.9 billion in net earnings for the year.\n\nBuffett in the past has repeatedly called on Congress to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying people like him should be paying more. He refrained from revisiting that call in his yearly update.\n\nBuffett also refrained from calling stocks overvalued, as he's done in past yearly updates, but he did say acquiring other companies had gotten overly expensive. His view that acquisitions need to come with a sensible purchase price prevented Berkshire from making a big deal in 2017, he wrote.\n\nWhile lower interest rates allowed acquirers to borrow money to finance their deals, Buffett dismissed the notion he would join the trend. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate acquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low. Referring to Charles Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, Buffett stated that both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don't.\n\nBuffett also said his company does have a plan for when he's no longer at the helm, despite the 87-year-old's stance that he has never felt better.
Former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds is up for sentencing on convictions that he failed to file tax returns for income he made while consulting for Chicago businessmen in Africa.\n\nThursday's sentencing comes some seven months after U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman found Reynolds guilty in a bench trial on four misdemeanor counts.\n\nReynolds has been representing himself. In a Wednesday filing, he argued that one year of probation would be an appropriate sentence. Prosecutors argued earlier that he deserves at least two years behind bars because he had flouted the law for so long. The maximum sentence is four years in prison.\n\nThe Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar resigned from Congress in 1995 after being convicted of statutory rape. He was later convicted on charges that included concealing debts.
NEW YORK -- When the Kushner Cos. bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.\n\nBut that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed. Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.\n\nNow a clue has emerged as to how President Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.\n\nWhile none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.\n\nIt's bare-faced greed, said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.\n\nKushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.\n\nKushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights, it said, adding that the company has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.\n\nFor the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.\n\nIn all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.\n\nHad the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled sweeps on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.\n\nInstead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.\n\nIt was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice, said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that he also bristled at a 60 percent rent increase, a hike the Kushner Cos. contends was initiated by the previous landord. They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.\n\nTax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.\n\nIn Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.\n\nAt a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.\n\nAll of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. ... You heard the drilling in the middle of night, said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.\n\nA knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.\n\nI know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out, Siwek recalls the man saying. We can offer you money.\n\nSiwek turned down the cash and sued instead. She said she won a year's worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.\n\nNew York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction.\n\nRent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings. To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.\n\nSubmitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an amended form with the correct numbers.\n\nHousing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.\n\nThere is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement, said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.\n\nNew York City's Department of Buildings did not comment in general about the false filings by the Kushner Cos., but said it disciplined a contractor who filed false documents while working on two of the Queens buildings, which are currently under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force. It added that the department is also ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.\n\nWe won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants - no matter who they are, spokesman Joseph Soldevere said.\n\nExactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.\n\nJared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.\n\nBack in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.\n\nHe hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.\n\nRomano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days - the mice.\n\nI still haven't gotten rid of them.
While death and taxes may be two inevitabilities of life, some people like to push the envelope when it comes to the latter.\n\nProcrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. The majority of Americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. Others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.\n\nBut issues such as higher preparation costs and even more delays may come hand-in-hand with putting off tax preparation until the last minute. Because the workload intensifies leading up to the filing deadline -- which is April 18 this year -- some certified public accountants will ask their procrastinating clients to file a tax extension. Consumers relying on tax software programs or online filing will face higher costs than if they had filed earlier in the season.\n\nTurboTax, for instance, ended its early season pricing on its online filing products on March 17, which means that consumers will now pay as much as 25 percent more for the same products. The company still offers its federal free edition, which is geared for consumers filing either the relatively simple 1040EZ or 1040A forms, although TurboTax said that is subject to change. TurboTax's Deluxe edition now costs $54.99 for federal returns, for instance, instead of the $34.99 before March 17.\n\nH&R Block, meanwhile, appears to have kept its online and software prices steady. Like TurboTax, it also offers a free filing option for simple tax returns. Still, many of those free filing options disappear later in the tax season, according to research from Oppenheimer & Co. cited by Bloomberg News. H&R Block didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAs for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your CPA may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until April 18. It's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the IRS receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.\n\nAs far as using an accountant, what I've seen, having worked for a CPA firm, they may (have) a deadline about when they want to see your tax documents because they get backed up, said Greene-Lewis. They may have a cut off where they put you on an extension.\n\nThere are a few issues to be aware of with extensions, such as the fact that payments are still due on April 18. That means people filing extensions will need a reasonable estimate of what they owe the tax agency by the deadline.\n\nYou should try to file as soon as possible, said Greene-Lewis, who noted that TurboTax users can file up to 11:59 p.m. on the night of the tax deadline. People who rush at the last minute may leave something out or forget about tax deductions and credits, even though we do remind you. It's best to do everything earlier.
smartphones are capturing all of life's moments, and doctor visits are no exception.\n\nat least 1 in 10 u.s. patients now records discussions at medical appointments, researchers said.\n\nbut do they have the right to do so?\n\nthe legality of these taped visits depends on where you live, said investigators from the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice.\n\nin the u.s., the situation is complex, said professor and senior scientist dr. glyn elwyn.\n\nwiretapping or eavesdropping statutes provide the primary legal framework guiding recording practices and protecting privacy, so a patient who would like to record a doctor's visit should familiarize themselves with laws in their state, elwyn said.\n\nthere are two main differences between state wiretapping laws, elwyn and his colleagues said in a new report.\n\nin all-party states, recordings made by doctors or patients are illegal unless everyone involved is aware and provides consent.\n\nin one-party states, just one person involved in a conversation needs to be aware and consent to the recording. only in these states can patients legally record an office visit without their doctor's consent and vice versa.\n\nthe authors said 39 states and washington, d.c., follow the one-party consent rule; all others adhere to the all-party requirement.\n\nhow are patients using these increasingly common recordings?\n\nafter reviewing 33 studies involving audio-recorded clinical visits, the researchers found that about 7 out of 10 patients listened to their own recordings. a similar number shared them with a caregiver.\n\nin many cases, patients used the tapes to remember important details about their office visits.\n\nmost people are sharing their recordings with a family member or caregiver, or they are listening to recording themselves, so they can better recall the information they received during the encounter, elwyn said in an institute news release.\n\npatients said the recordings left them feeling more satisfied with their care.\n\nhealth care overall is moving toward greater transparency and patient recordings are going to become more common, elwyn said.\n\nthat means there would be tremendous benefit to patient advocacy groups, health care organizations, providers and policymakers working together to develop clear guidelines and policies around the responsible, positive use of open recordings, he added.\n\nwhile some doctors and hospitals worry that taped appointments and procedures will be used against them, others take a more positive view. the barrow neurological institute in phoenix, for example, encourages patient-doctor recordings and rewards doctors who comply, the researchers said.\n\nthe report was published july 10 in the journal of the american medical association.

democratic congressman jerry nadler of new york, the incoming chairman of the powerful house judiciary committee, pledged to conduct strong oversight of the white house when his party takes control of the house on thursday, but said democrats should wait and see before discussing impeachment proceedings against president trump.\n\nfor the last two years, the president has had no oversight, no accountability from congress. the republican congress was completely derelict in its responsibility to provide oversight, nadler said on cbs this morning wednesday. we're going to provide that oversight. we're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.\n\nnadler said that the judiciary committee will also hold hearings on the december deaths of two migrant children in border patrol custody. this is inhuman and it's not precedented, he said, referring to the white house's hardline immigration agenda. it's a deliberate creation of the trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. and if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that.\n\nthe veteran new york lawmaker said house democrats will use their investigative committee powers over the administration to probe the white house's controversial migrant family separation policy — which it was forced to rescind after a massive public uproar — as well as the appointment of acting attorney general matthew whitaker, who has previously denounced special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian meddling in u.s. elections and alleged coordination between the trump campaign and moscow.\n\nstill, nadler stressed that his committee, which has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, will only hold impeachment hearings against the president if certain criteria are met.\n\nimpeachment is designed as a defense of the republic against a president who would aggrandize power, destroy liberty, destroy democratic institutions, destroy the separations of power, he said. if that happens, if you get real evidence of that, then you have to consider impeachment hearings.\n\nthere's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it, nadler added.\n\nasked about the partial government shutdown and impasse in budget negotiations between lawmakers and the white house over mr. trump's unwavering demand for $5 billion in funding to construct a wall along the u.s.-mexico border, nadler said his fellow house democrats intend to pass six appropriations bills to fund most of the government and a continuing resolution to fund the department of homeland security (dhs) until feb. 8.\n\nbecause his party's proposals do not include any additional funding for a border wall, it is unlikely that they will be backed by the president and a republican-controlled senate. mr. trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional republicans and democrats on wednesday to discuss the stalemate in negotiations.\n\nnadler said the partial shutdown, which began on dec. 22, is mr. trump's attempt to blackmail the american public because he feels beleaguered by criticism from his own party, high-profile resignations in his administration and looming democratic control of the house.\n\nit is an extremist policy designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country hostage, he said.
washington -- iran could comply with last summer's nuclear deal as early as friday or this weekend, officials said, requiring the united states and other nations to immediately suspend billions of dollars' worth of economic sanctions on the islamic republic.\n\nsecretary of state john kerry predicted wednesday the achievement could happen within the next coming days.\n\nkerry also said iran was in the process of disabling the central vessel, or calandria, for its heavy water reactor at arak that would have been able to produce plutonium, a pathway to nuclear weapons.\n\njust yesterday, the foreign minister (of iran) reported to me that the calandria of the plutonium nuclear reactor is now out and in the next hours it will be filled with concrete and destroyed, kerry said wednesday.\n\njust hours after welcoming iran's release of 10 u.s. sailors it detained when their boats wandered on to an iranian island in the persian gulf, kerry said in a speech at the national defense university that implementation of the nuclear agreement will take place soon, without specifying an exact date.\n\nothers in washington and elsewhere told the associated press the announcement could come within two days. in vienna, a senior diplomat from one of the six countries that cut the deal with iran said it would be formally declared implemented most probably friday. those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nin tehran, iran's deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi echoed that sentiment.\n\nhe said the international atomic energy agency is expected to verify iran's compliance on friday and that iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini would then announce implementation day, according to iran's official irna news agency.\n\ni believe the parties will perform their undertakings by friday and saturday and sunday and the implementation day would be announced on that time, araghchi said.\n\nhe said the foreign ministers who negotiated the july accord - including kerry, zarif and their counterparts from britain, china, france, germany and russia - may meet to deliver a joint statement. kerry is expected to be in europe this weekend on other business.\n\nunder the terms of the deal, once iran meets its obligations to curb its nuclear program, it is to receive wide-ranging sanctions relief. for the u.s. that means suspension of nuclear-related sanctions on iranian oil, banking and commerce.\n\niran was required to ship out most of its stockpile of enriched uranium, a material that can be used for making bombs, and take apart thousands of the centrifuges that enrich the material. most of the nuclear restrictions last 10 or 15 years.\n\nwhile iran accomplished most of the biggest tasks in recent weeks, several technical hiccups remained. officials had spoken of lingering questions related to iran's uranium and plutonium programs, including over the properties of certain centrifuges iran would be permitted to maintain for research purposes.\n\nit's not clear how quickly iran would reap the benefits of the deal.\n\ntehran expects to quickly recoup some $100 billion worth of its assets that have been frozen in overseas banks, a tremendous windfall for an economy with a gdp of little more than $400 billion in 2014.\n\nwhile the iranians have aggressively courted foreign companies and investors in recent months, it is unclear how quickly contracts can be finalized. also unknown is how determined major western firms, in particular, will be given the risk of snapback sanctions if iran violates the deal and the history of u.s. penalties against european banks that have previously conducted business with iran.
american airlines will no longer allow emotional support animals to travel on its planes other than as carry-on pets or in the cargo. the carrier is adopting a department of transportation rule that takes effect next week. it defines a service animal as a dog trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, a narrower definition than in the past.\n\nwhen the rule goes into effect january 11, american will no longer authorize new travel for animals that do not meet that definition, such as emotional support animals, the airline announced tuesday in a news release.\n\nthe airline said existing bookings involving emotional support animals will be honored through february 1, when the company's new policies go into effect.\n\nanimals that had previously traveled as emotional support animals and no longer qualify as service animals can travel as carry-on pets or in the cargo provided they meet the airline's requirements, american added. the airline will collect a pet fee ranging from $125 to several hundred dollars for transporting pets, according to the associated press.\n\nwe're confident this approach will enable us to better serve our customers, particularly those with disabilities who travel with service animals, and better protect our team members at the airport and on the aircraft, jessica tyler, president of cargo and vice president of airport excellence for american, said in a statement.\n\nalaska airlines a week ago also said it would no longer accept emotional support animals. other airlines are also expected to adopt the new policy.\n\nthe transportation department early last month said it was reversing its long-held position that required airlines to allow passengers to travel with emotional support animals as long they had note from a doctor.\n\nthe agency's switch follows an increase in service animal complaints from passengers with disabilities, misbehavior by emotional support animals, a lack of clarity around the definition of service animal and disruptions caused by requests to transport unusual species of animals onboard aircraft, according to the dot.\n\nairlines for years have struggled to contend with travelers who brought a menagerie of animals on board, including cats, turtles, pigs and other creatures.\n\nhigh-profile incidents involving animals on flights include police being called to remove a woman with an emotional support squirrel from a 2018 frontier airlines flight and united airlines bouncing a passenger who wanted to bring a peacock on board.
investors seem unimpressed with the federal reserve's largest interest rate cut since 2008, pushing down stocks amid mounting concerns over the coronavirus.\n\nthe dow fell 786 points, or almost 3%, to 25,917 on tuesday, while the s&p 500 and tech-heavy nasdaq indexes both slid about 3%. the decline followed a surprise move by the central bank to lower rates by 0.5% in a bid to bolster the u.s. economy as the coronavirus spreads to more states. the rate cut comes after seven major economies pledged early tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the outbreak.\n\nthe subdued reaction of the equity market suggests a typical buy the rumor and sell the fact, and we continue to anticipate two weeks of high volatility in the markets, sebastien galy, senior macro strategist at nordea asset management, said in an email after the fed's decisions.\n\nin another sign investors are seeking refuge from market volatility, the price of 10-year treasury notes surged, pushing the yield to below 1% — the first time that has ever happened, according to bloomberg. the fed said in a statement that while the u.s. economy remains strong, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.\n\nwall street is weighing the impact of the coronavirus as more companies warn the outbreak will crimp profitability, while others cut back on employee travel and ask employees to work from home. the market decline on tuesday follows yesterday's surge of 5.1%, when investors were buoyed by the prospect of a fed rate cut. the dow last plunged more than 12%, marking the fastest recorded slide into market correction territory — defined as a decline of at least 10% from a previous high.\n\npresident trump, who has repeatedly criticized fed chair jerome powell for not easing interest rates, pressed policy makers to do more even after the rate cut. more easing and cutting!, mr. trump said in a tweet.\n\ng-7 announcement\n\non tuesday morning, the g-7 countries said they are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nthe joint statement from the u.s., japan, germany, britain, france, italy and canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin and federal reserve chairman jerome powell. but investors were looking for concrete actions, analysts noted.\n\nglobal equities were disappointed with the 175-word statement of g7 finance ministers and central bank governors, said edward moya, senior market strategist at oanda, in a research note issued before the fed cut rates. wall street's patience will be tested as downward pressures grow for signs of a fiscal response.\n\nmeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb in the u.s. the new disease has killed six people in the u.s., four from one nursing home near seattle and two others in the same county. the cluster of deaths at the nursing facility in washington state's king county highlights the serious threat the disease poses to older people and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nthere were just over 100 cases in 15 states as of tuesday morning, with new hampshire and georgia being the most recent to join the battle against the virus.
if you're reading this from the comfort of your home office, you may want to thank ibm for helping to make that possible.\n\nthe technology giant that gave us the floppy disk, automated teller machine and watson supercomputer has also been a trailblazer in terms of allowing employees to work remotely. ibm began allowing some of its employees to work at home during the reagan era, and by 2009 40 percent of its 386,000 staffers worldwide were no longer tethered to a traditional office. tens of thousands more worked remotely at least occasionally, according to a company report.\n\nnow, big blue -- which helped launch the work-from-home movement to slash its real estate costs and retain talent -- has become the latest corporate behemoth to call some of its troops back to the office. honeywell, yahoo, best buy, hewlett-packard and bank of america have made similar moves over the last several years. like ibm, they cited the need to improve teamwork, idea-sharing, speed and agility.\n\nneedless to say, not all their employees are thrilled. some ibmers have reportedly polished up their resumes and begun looking for new jobs.\n\nas more and more companies in the u.s. have adopted work-from-home policies, employees have grown to expect a measure of control over when and where they work -- and they appear to be getting it. last year, 43 percent of employees worked remotely in some capacity, meaning they spent at least some of their time working in a different location than their co-workers, according to a gallup report. that was up from 39 percent in 2012.\n\nibm, however, is among a handful of big employers that are reversing course. last month, the company informed its u.s. marketing team of about 2,600 people that working remotely on a full-time basis would no longer be an option, according to media accounts.\n\nian colley, an ibm spokesman, confirmed that marketing employees have been asked to work out of six new digital marketing facilities located in austin, texas; san francisco; new york city; cambridge, massachusetts; atlanta; and raleigh, north carolina.\n\nas a result, employees who worked remotely -- whether from home or an office other than the one to which they are now assigned -- will need to commute, move, change offices within the same city or find another job. colley declined to say how many staffers are impacted by the policy change or when it takes effect.\n\nibm is helping to pay moving expenses for workers who opt to relocate. for employees who need to move because of the new policy but can't for some reason, ibm will help them find other jobs internally, according to colley.\n\nmost ibm marketing employees already work out of an office (rather than from home) and live within commuting distance of one of the six new facilities, he said.\n\nibm remains committed to work-life balance and still allows members of co-located teams to sometimes work at home, colley said. those teams include not only marketing but also chief information officers, the watson division and certain software development groups.\n\nas marketing shifts to digital marketing, the need to work in an agile way becomes more apparent, said colley, explaining the reason for the new marketing-department policy.\n\nmarketing is no longer a 'waterfall' type work process, where work is handed from one person to another. modern marketing requires that people on a team be able to iterate programs in real-time based on live feedback. this requires them to collaborate much more closely, he added.\n\nibm appears to be bucking a trend. on the whole, companies are offering workers greater flexibility in terms of when and where they work, and not just because it helps with their recruiting efforts. studies have shown that employee engagement and productivity often improve as a result.\n\nin 2016, 40 percent of large companies allowed employees to work at home at least some of the time on a regular basis, up from 33 percent in 2012, according to a study by the society for human resource management and the families and work institute.\n\nmany companies allow working from home because it holds down their office-rental costs and the low- or no-value-added time workers spend commuting, particularly in cities with heavy rush-hour traffic, explained brad harrington, executive director of the boston college center for work & family, whose corporate sponsors include ibm.\n\na lot of times people think of [working from home] as an accommodation for working parents, but that's not necessarily the case, he explained. there are organizational benefits to it, added harrington.\n\nthere may also be organizational costs in terms of teamwork, innovation and corporate culture, experts said.\n\nyou start to get an erosion of corporate culture when you have workers spread far and wide, said tom gimbel, chief executive officer of staff and recruiting firm lasalle network in chicago.\n\nthe same can be said for the culture of colleges that specialize in online programs, gimbel added. you don't see many people wearing a college sweatshirt for the university of phoenix, he noted.\n\nfor employees, there may be some drawbacks to working from home from a career-growth perspective, gimbel said. less face-time with higher ups could be a liability.\n\nyour opportunities for promotion are less if you're not in the office interacting with senior management, he said.
thanks to a post-earnings lift from boeing (ba), the dow jones industrials ended a five-day losing streak on wednesday. the nasdaq composite wasn't as lucky, however, posting its fifth straight loss.\n\ntreasury yields and corporate earnings remain the focus, with the 10-year treasury pushing further above the 3 percent level on wednesday, closing at 3.03 percent -- a high not seen since 2014. the 2-year treasury hit 2.49 percent -- its highest close in nearly a decade.\n\na combination of factors are behind these upward moves, including expectations of another federal reserve interest rate hike in june, rising inflation expectations and growing evidence that wage inflation is just around the corner.\n\nhistorical data comparing the relationship of job availability vs. wage gains shows -- if history is any guide -- that pay raises are coming. which will provide the raw fuel needed to push up prices throughout the economy.\n\nwatch for fed policymakers to explore this point in their statement due next week. currently, the futures market has essentially priced in another quarter-point hike at the fed's june meeting. but the odds of an accelerating pace of rate increases is rising, with a 38 percent chance of three more this year (for a total of four), up from a 28 percent chance a month again.\n\nthis policy and inflation outlook is overshadowing what has been an extremely strong first-quarter earnings season so far. according to factset, s&p 500 earnings growth so far is tracking at 18.3 percent vs. last year's first quarter, with record high net profit margins.\n\njust look at facebook (fb), which jumped 6.8 percent in after-hours trading following its report of earnings of $1.69 per share vs. $1.36 estimated on $12 billion in ad revenue. daily active users increased 13 percent over last year, laying to rest the #deletefacebook fears.\n\nbut echoing the cautiousness of caterpillar (cat) management on tuesday, who warned that the company's first-quarter results could be a high water mark for 2018 profitability, investors seem to be increasingly aware that the rest of this year may not be a walk in the park for stocks. worries are growing that higher interest rates will jeopardize many of the tailwinds the bulls have enjoyed for years: debt-funded share buybacks, cheap consumer credit, affordable mortgages, low auto loan payments and higher bond prices.
washington — seven major economies, including the u.s., pledged tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the spreading coronavirus, while stopping short of immediate actions. the group of major industrial countries, referred to as the g-7, said it was ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nthe joint statement from the u.s., japan, germany, britain, france, italy and canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin and federal reserve chairman jerome powell.\n\ngiven the potential impacts of covid-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks, the g-7 said.\n\nthe g-7 has issued similar statements during periods of market turmoil, such as the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nmarkets soared monday amid a growing conviction by investors that the federal reserve and other central banks around the world would cut interest rates in a move to shore up economic growth. wall street analysts expect fed officials to lower rates at their next meeting on march 17-18 and possibly again in april.\n\ndespite the g-7's commitment to work together, the group's response appeared to disappoint some on wall street.\n\nthis is a disappointment compared to previous hopes of an immediate and coordinated fiscal package and interest rate cuts, although such hopes had already been dampened by information leaked from 'g7 officials' early this morning, jennifer mckeown, head of global economics service at capital economics, said in a note.\n\nthe research firm has said it expects the number of coronavirus cases in the u.s. to climb exponentially in the coming weeks and for economic growth to slow. capital economics expects the fed to cut rates by a total of 0.5% by mid-year due to the virus.\n\ncarl weinberg of high frequency economics said in a report that investors were hoping for a lot more from the g-7 announcement.\n\nstock futures in the u.s. were flat tuesday ahead of the start of trade.
one of sydney chaffee's students describes her as blunt, calm and nice at the same time. others in her classroom in dorchester, massachusetts, say she's a good listener – simply the best.\n\nsydney chaffee cbs news\n\nchaffee, who's among the 3.1 million teachers who educate the 50.4 million public school students across the country, was honored thursday as the 2017 national teacher of the year. the 9th grade humanities teacher has spent 10 years at codman academy, a charter public school where 98 percent of the students are minorities and 75 percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. one hundred percent of codman academy's graduates are accepted into college.\n\nthe magic behind her effectiveness and popularity is a deep desire to make change and to build relationships with kids.\n\ni want my students to understand that they are powerful and that they can make change in the world. that whatever the future is that they want to see, they have the power and they have the agency to make that happen, and so that's at the core of everything that we're doing, chaffee said on cbs this morning.\n\nat codman academy, it's school policy for the students call teachers by their first names.\n\nwe want to just sort of show that we're on the same level, and it's a community and we have relationships, chaffee said.\n\nshe also stresses social justice in her classroom.\n\nwe learn a lot about history, and the history of people who have been oppressed and the history of people who have been marginalized and how those people have fought for justice, chaffee explained. so we learn about resistance movements and then we sort of relate that to today and say, 'ok, so what can we learn from this, and how will you be a powerful person in the world?'\n\nas a teacher, she recognizes that she herself can always learn more.\n\nso this award is so humbling because i always am thinking about how i can be better at this job, and i know that all of my colleagues are always thinking that too. and so that's another part of the magic ... that teachers understand that we're learners. we're always learners and we model that for our kids, chaffee said.
ciudad hidalgo, mexico — a new caravan of around 1,800 central americans is making its way toward the u.s. the group started crossing into mexico last weekend, and the long line to enter stretches back to a bridge on the border.\n\nthousands of migrants left honduras a week ago after word about a new caravan spread on facebook. the orderly lines are a stark contrast to october's caravan, when an influx of migrants overwhelmed the mexican government and created a bottleneck on the same bridge. some jumped to swim to mexico instead, and other migrants tore down a fence to gain entry.\n\nwhere there was once a fence, there's now a gate that is wide open. but migrants have to wait on a long line. it's the result of mexico's new open-door migration policy that is just a week old.\n\nevery migrant that enters legally first gets a bracelet. with their wristband, they can get a humanitarian visa, which takes about five days. once inside, migrants are photographed, interviewed, fingerprinted and get iris recognition scans to keep track of who is entering.\n\nmarcos alonzo, who earned $4 a day back home, left honduras a week ago with a group. though he could stay in mexico for under the new policy, he's bound for the u.s. he said he has heard about president trump's border wall, but doesn't think it will go up by the time he arrives at the border.\n\nof the thousands of migrants that made it to the u.s. border in the last major caravan, less than 700 remain in tijuana hoping for asylum.\n\ncbs news asked officials in mexico if they are incentivizing migrants to come north. they said the migrants will come no matter what and legal migration provides rights and protections. the question is how many will stay in mexico and how many will head to the u.s.
baghdad — iraq issued a warrant for the arrest of u.s. president donald trump on thursday as part of a baghdad court's investigation into the killing of a top iraqi paramilitary commander. abu mahdi al-muhandis, the deputy head of iraq's largely pro-iran hashed al-shaabi paramilitary network, died in the same u.s. drone strike that killed storied iranian general qasem soleimani at baghdad airport on january 3 last year.\n\nthe strike on their motorcade was ordered by mr. trump, who later crowed that it had taken out two (men) for the price of one.\n\nan arrest warrant against the outgoing president of the united states of america, donald trump, has been issued in accordance with the provisions of article 406 of the iraqi penal code, iraq's supreme judicial council confirmed in a statement on thursday, adding that the investigations would continue to identify others who participated in committing this crime, whether they are iraqis or foreigners.\n\nthe united nations special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, agnes callamard, has described the twin killings as arbitrary and illegal.\n\niran already issued a warrant for mr. trump's arrest in june, and asked interpol to relay it as a so-called red notice to other police forces around the world. interpol made it clear there was no intention to meet iran's request.\n\nunlike adversary iran, iraq is a key u.s. ally in the middle east. while the u.s. military presence in the country has diminished significantly under president trump's orders, to around 2,500 troops at present, billions of u.s. tax dollars have been spent, and american forces have been killed, shoring the iraqi government up to defend itself from terrorist groups, and to help it resist the influence of its neighbor to the north, iran.\n\na member of lebanon's hezbollah stands in front of a picture depicting senior iranian military commander general qassem soleimani (right) and iraqi militia commander abu mahdi al-muhandis who were killed in a u.s. attack, during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of their killing in the southern village of khiam, lebanon, january 3, 2021. aziz taher/reuters\n\nit was the court for east baghdad that actually issued the warrant for mr. trump's arrest under article 406 of iraq's penal code, which provides for the death penalty in all cases of premeditated murder, but the supreme judicial council, which runs all of iraq's courts much like the u.s. department of justice, confirmed the warrant.\n\nwhile the soon-to-be former u.s. president may be unlikely to visit iraq any time soon, the order for his arrest highlights the huge resentment against u.s. policy in iraq, and the deeply entrenched influence of iran among iraq's large shiite muslim population.\n\nthe u.s. military had braced for any possible retaliatory attacks by iran or iraq's pro-iran militias, which have fired rockets at american bases many times since the strike last year, but there was no violence on the anniversary of the attack over the weekend.\n\niraq's national government has at times struggled to maintain cordial relations with both its biggest global partner, washington, and its neighbor iran.\n\neven as the court issued the arrest warrant on thursday, u.s. ambassador to iraq matthew tueller met nearby in baghdad with president barham salih to discuss the importance of reducing tensions and avoiding escalation, supporting efforts to enhance security, stability and peace in the region, and resolving the outstanding issues through dialogue, according to a statement posted on salih's twitter feed (below).
as vaccinations continue across the u.s., some companies are offering financial incentives to encourage their workers to get their shots.\n\ninstacart inc., the grocery delivery service, announced thursday that it would provide a $25 stipend for workers who get the covid-19 vaccine. it joins others, including trader joe's and dollar general, which plan to pay workers extra if they get vaccinated.\n\nour goal with the introduction of our new vaccine support stipend is to ensure that, when the time comes, instacart shoppers don't have to choose between earning income as an essential service provider or getting vaccinated, instacart ceo apoorva mehta said in a statement.\n\nsan francisco-based instacart has nearly doubled its mostly gig workforce to about 500,000 to meet a surge in demand for online grocery shopping since the pandemic erupted in the u.s. last spring.\n\ngrocery chain trader joe's, which has more than 50,000 employees, said thursday it will give its employees two hours of pay per dose for getting the vaccine. the monrovia, california-based company said it will also shift around schedules to make sure employees have time to get vaccinated.\n\ndollar general said wednesday it will give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they get the vaccine. the goodlettsville, tennessee-based retailer said it employs 157,000 people.\n\na vaccine advisory panel at the u.s. centers for disease control voted late last month on recommendations for vaccine distribution. the panel said grocery workers — which would include instacart and dollar general's employees — should be in the second group to receive shots after health care workers and nursing home residents.\n\nit is up to each state to decide how and when to adopt the cdc's recommendations. some states have already opened eligibility to the second group, which also includes firefighters, police, teachers, corrections workers, postal employees and people 75 and older. there are around 50 million people in that group.\n\ncompanies can mandate that workers get covid-19 vaccines as a requirement for employment, although they must make accommodations for medical or religious reasons, according to guidance from the federal equal employment opportunity commission.\n\nhowever, most companies are reluctant to impose such mandates, said sharon perley masling, a partner at the law firm morgan lewis who has been advising clients on workplace issues surrounding the covid-19 pandemic. the emergency nature of the vaccine's fda approval makes it impractical for many companies to require it, given that the shots are not available to most of the population, she said.\n\nstill, masling said the companies she works with are taking various steps to strongly encourage their workers to get vaccinated, including internal public relations campaigns showing top executives who are eligible getting the shots. other incentives include free child care, paid time off and freebies such as pizza delivery and other gifts, she said.\n\nit's good for employees, it's good for their communities and it's good for ensuring the continuation of business operations, masling said.\n\nthe push to vaccinate comes amid signs that some people — even health care workers — are reluctant to get the shots, contributing to a slower-than-hoped-for rollout of the mass vaccination effort in the u.s. masling said many companies are still trying to figure out how their staff feels about taking the shots, with some sending out internal surveys.\n\nconcerns over side effects\n\nin a survey last month by the society for human resource management, nearly two-thirds of u.s. workers said they were likely to get the vaccine when it becomes available. still, 36% said they were not likely to get vaccinated, citing as their main reason concerns about side effects. shrm surveyed workers from 529 u.s. households using the amerispeak omnibus survey, a probability-based panel developed by norc at the university of chicago.\n\nscientists say the vaccines have been rigorously tested on tens of thousands and vetted by independent experts, and there have been no signs of widespread severe side effects from the shots.\n\nnot every company is offering incentives. delivery app doordash, another big platform for gig workers, said it has asked the cdc and governors to prioritize delivery workers in vaccine distribution. but it doesn't plan to provide perks for workers who get vaccinated.\n\ntarget corp. doesn't plan to provide incentives either, but said it will make the vaccine free and accessible to its 350,000 employees. target said 1,700 of its stores have a cvs pharmacy on site that will offer the vaccine to staff when it's available.\n\nalbertsons, a grocery chain with 2,250 u.s. stores and 300,000 employees, also isn't doling out financial incentives. like doordash, it's asking state and local authorities to make sure its workers get priority for the vaccine.\n\na separate shrm survey last month found that while about two-thirds of u.s. employers planned to encourage employees to get vaccinated, only 3% have decided to require it for at least some workers. that could change, since 55% of employers said they were unsure if they would eventually require it, according to survey of 955 members of shrm, an organization of about 300,000 human resource professionals.\n\nbad press\n\nmany large companies have faced criticism over how they have treated their employees throughout the pandemic, from shoddy sick leave policies to poor working conditions. companies, ranging from meatpacking plants to amazon, have grappled with worker absences and outbreaks that have forced temporary shutdowns of their factories and warehouses. there is also a looming debate in congress over whether employers should be exempt from legal liabilities related to coronavirus exposure, as more begin to recall their employees back to offices and other work sites.\n\npublic perception provides a strong incentive for companies to get their workers vaccinated, said laura boudreau, an economics professor at columbia business school who specializes in labor rights.\n\na lot of them have had to defend their reputations in terms of how they are treating their employees throughout the pandemic, boudreau said.\n\ninstacart is among several companies that have lobbied for their workers to be prioritized for vaccines. the company also has faced criticism, and some worker unrest, over allegations that it had not done enough to protect its shoppers — gig workers who make multiple trips a day to grocery stores to shop for and deliver groceries to people who order on its app — who don't receive health insurance through the company or guaranteed paid

amazon is asking third-party sellers to stop shipping most goods to its warehouses as the online retailer grapples with a coronavirus-fueled surge in demand for medical supplies and household products.\n\nthe ecommerce company told sellers in a note on tuesday that it will only ship household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products unless amazon already has other purchased items on hand in its warehouses.\n\nthe pause lasts through at least april 5 and will apply to amazon shipments in the u.s. and european union. products already in amazon warehouses, or those currently in transit on their way to the facilities, will not be affected, the company said.\n\nthe change affects third-party shippers that rely on amazon's fulfillment service, as well merchants who sell directly to amazon. sellers that package and ship their own goods will not be affected by the temporary change in policy..\n\nwe are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock, amazon told cbs moneywatchh in a statement. with this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.\n\nproducts that amazon is prioritizing for shipment must fall into one of six categories, according to the company:\n\nbaby products\n\nhealth and household products\n\nbeauty and personal care products (including personal care appliances)\n\ngrocery products\n\nindustrial and scientific products\n\npet supplies.\n\namazon told customers last weekend that waits for some products could take longer than the usual two days. many common items, such as soap and diapers, were listed as unavailable on tuesday.\n\nthird-party businesses constitute most of the sellers on amazon's vast platform, generating more sales than even the products sold directly by amazon, according to business insider. while they are independent businesses, these sellers often heavily rely on amazon and have little say in setting the terms of their interaction.\n\nwe understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly. we are working around the clock to increase capacity, amazon wrote in its note.\n\nthat didn't assuage many sellers, with some writing that the change could put them out of business. others called for compassion for the workers who pack and ship amazon goods and whose jobs don't allow them to work from home during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nfor most of us, this would mean inconvenience. for those at risk, it means a matter of life and death, one poster wrote in a seller forum.\n\namazon has faced a surge in orders as coronavirus panic sets in across the u.s. and more people shop online. the company announced on monday it would hire 100,000 additional workers to deal with unprecedented labor needs.
iowa rep. steve king is facing criticism after he defended white nationalism and white supremacy in an interview. white nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization — how did that language become offensive? king said to the new york times. why did i sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\n\nhe later posted a statement to twitter, after the interview was published, saying, i want to make one thing abundantly clear; i reject those labels and the evil ideology represented by those terms. i am simply a nationalist, he said, not a white nationalist or white supremacist.\n\ni condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent jewish lives, he wrote. like the founding fathers, he wrote, i am an advocate for western civilization's values.\n\nking, one of the most right-wing members of congress, also told times that he is not a racist, saying his twitter timeline shows him greeting iowans of all races and religions in his washington office. he said he supports immigrants who come to the u.s. legally and assimilate, since the culture of america matters more than race.\n\nmy statement on the new york times article. pic.twitter.com/ijbhgzygrd — steve king (@stevekingia) january 10, 2019\n\nseveral top republicans spoke out to condemn the remark. house minority leader kevin mccarthy said, everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation. steve's language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. the declaration of independence states that 'all men are created equal.' that is a fact. it is self-evident.\n\nminority whip steve scalise said, i think it is offensive to try to legitimize those terms. i think it was important that he rejected that kind of evil because that's what it is, it's evil ideology.\n\nand the number three house republican leader, gop conference chairwoman liz cheney, blasted king's remarks, tweeting about the times interview, these comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.\n\nthese comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse. steve king asks how terms 'white nationalist' and 'white supremacist' became offensive | thehill https://t.co/yl23avpnfb — liz cheney (@liz_cheney) january 10, 2019\n\nking's comments come as he is facing a primary challenge in 2020 from state sen. randy feenstra. king fended off a challenge from democrat j.d. scholten in 2018, although he won by a narrower margin than he has in the past.\n\nin the interview, king credits himself with president trump's shift to his own hardline views on immigration. donald trump came to iowa as a real nonideological candidate, king said. he recalled telling mr. trump, i market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something. king in the past has shown a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed on the house floor.\n\nking, 69, has attained notoriety for statements and positions that appeal to white nationalists. his history of controversial comments caused the national republican congressional committee to rescind all support for him before the 2018 election, with nrcc chairman steve stivers condemning him and white supremacy and hate. king has lost support from a number of prominent corporate donors, and the state's republican governor has also spoken out against him.\n\n-cbs news' rebecca kaplan contributed reporting.
amman, jordan — the united arab emirates said friday that it would reopen all of its land, sea and air borders with persian gulf neighbor qatar, the latest significant step to end a crisis that was a major diplomatic thorn in the side of u.s. policy for several years. in a statement carried by the country's official news agency, uae foreign minister anwar gargash said the end of his country's blockade of qatar would include practical measures of airlines, shipping and trade.\n\nthe move followed a gulf cooperation council summit on tuesday in the ancient saudi city of al-ula, where a breakthrough agreement marked the end of the rift between qatar and its neighbors. late on monday, saudi arabia, the biggest country involved in the blockade, said it would reopen its airspace and land border to qatar in the first step toward ending the crisis.\n\nsaudi arabian television carried live pictures of crown prince mohammed bin salman warmly welcoming qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani to the summit. the pictures from the tarmac at the saudi airport sent a powerful signal.\n\nemir of qatar sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani (l) is welcomed by crown prince of saudi arabia mohammed bin salman ahead of the 41st summit of gulf cooperation council in al-ula, saudi arabia, january 5, 2021. royal council of saudi arabia/handout/anadolu agency/getty\n\nthe breakthrough came after an extensive diplomatic push led by president donald trump's son-in-law and senior adviser jared kushner. it also came just ahead of president-elect joe biden's swearing in.\n\nthe incoming u.s. administration is expected to take a firmer stance towards the kingdom than president trump, whose family has close ties with the saudi royals.\n\nthe blockade began in 2017 when saudi arabia, the uae, bahrain and egypt accused the tiny state of qatar of supporting islamic extremists — charges qatar has always firmly denied.\n\nqatar not only survived, but managed largely to avoid any serious impact from the blockade thanks to its wealth, accumulated over decades from vast natural gas reserves.\n\nthe gcc leaders signed an agreement this week for a complete resumption of diplomatic relations between the boycotting arab quartet and qatar, and to jointly confront any threats to gulf security.\n\nthe chief threat alluded to in the statement by the gulf nations was that posed by their other neighbor, iran. the u.s. government has long relied on its allies in the gulf to present a united front against the shiite muslim powerhouse.\n\nqatar airways has announced that its planes will return to using saudi airspace. during the blockade, the airline was forced to divert most of its flights through iranian airspace, and washington was keen to deprive tehran of the hundreds of millions of dollars in overflight fees the qataris were paying.\n\nminister of state for foreign affairs for the united arab emirates, anwar gargash, speaks at an event at chatham house in london, england, july 17, 2017. reuters/neil hall\n\nspeaking at a virtual news conference on thursday, gargash, the uae's top diplomat, said his country was behind this deal, and positive about the prospect of reestablishing relations with qatar.\n\nhe added, however, that restoring full diplomatic ties would take time and depended on qatar's future dealings with iran, turkey and islamic extremist groups. we have a very good start, said gargash, but we have issues with rebuilding trust.\n\nthe basic issues that the emiratis are talking about are still there, dr. hassan barari, professor of international relations at qatar university, told cbs news on friday. the differences are going to continue, but the problem is how to manage these differences.\n\npeople here in doha insist on their right to have a different foreign policy, barari said of qatar's leadership. the reconciliation with saudi arabia is very important for qataris, but for them it is more important to be independent.
with four days to go until monday's iowa caucuses, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the democratic nomination, former vice president joe biden and vermont senator bernie sanders.\n\ncbs news campaign reporter jack turman says buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. his attacks on biden and sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind biden and sanders, albeit narrowly.\n\ni hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said thursday at a town hall in decorah. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind. buttigieg then pivoted to sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors medicare for all and free college tuition at public universities.\n\ni hear senator sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, buttigieg continued. and it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\n\nbuttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating sanders would be a risk at a time when democrats are desperate to reclaim the white house from president trump.\n\nbuttigieg has remained in the top tier of democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. the most recent des moines register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely iowa caucus-goers while sanders was the first choice of 20%. the same poll in november found buttigieg leading the democratic field in the state with 25% support.\n\nthe millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face mr. trump with strong showings in iowa and new hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on february 11th. he hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in nevada and south carolina, where is currently polling well behind sanders and biden.\n\nwhile maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between sanders and biden over social security. the vermont senator has accused biden of being open to cutting social security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\n\nthis is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, buttigieg said. the less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better. after his town hall in decorah, buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. we're competing, buttigieg told reporters. it's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. i admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.\n\nmeanwhile, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson notes that at a speech in newton, iowa, biden spoke about the importance of 2020 democrats focusing on mr. trump and not swinging at each other. the former vice president said we shouldn't let this democratic race slide into negative attacks. the temptation is too much for some biden added, while highlighting president obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.\n\nearlier in the day, biden delivered a speech in waukee, iowa where he didn't name a single rival democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. in the home stretch, biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: the soul of the nation is at risk due to mr. trump's actions and moral turpitude.\n\nfrom the candidates\n\njoe biden\n\nas joe biden goes up on the air in nevada with several new ads in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per kantar cmag data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to cbs news campaign reporter alex tin. among them are two former clark county party chairs, the vice president of the washoe county school district board of trustees, and online betting ceo joe asher, who was listed last year as a top fundraising bundler for biden.\n\nmichael bloomberg\n\nthursday democratic presidential candidate and former new york mayor michael bloomberg released his super bowl ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in america, according to cbs news campaign reporter tim perry.\n\nthe 60 second spot, titled george, will air sunday february 2 during super bowl liv. it features the story of calandrian simpson kemp, a mother whose son, george kemp jr., was shot and killed in 2013.\n\nin the aftermath of her son's death, kemp has been an active member of moms demand action. i chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.\n\ncalandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of washington to address it. people will be rooting for different teams in the super bowl, but virtually all americans — including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners — support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws.\n\nbloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including iowa where voting begins monday, bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week.\n\npete buttigieg\n\nequality california, the state's largest lgbtq civil rights organization, and its recently-launched nevada partner silver state equality announced thursday they would be backing pete buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee. cbs news campaign reporter alex tin says the former south bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in california, where buttigieg has failed to crack double digits in recent polls of the super tuesday contest.\n\nwhile we did not endorse mayor pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the lgbtq community, rick zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising elizabeth warren and tom steyer for their extremely strong platforms.\n\ntulsi gabbard\n\ncongresswoman tulsi gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in new hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in february. and while other candidates focus on next week's iowa caucuses, gabbard has all but moved to new hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other democratic candidate across december and january.\n\na recent analysis by the new york times reveals just one-fifth of obama-trump voters returned to the democratic party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted republican. roughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.\n\n[s]he's pulling from trump voters. it could make it even tougher for trump to win, particularly in states like michigan and new hampshire, bannon told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga.\n\nbernie sanders\n\nbernie sanders' first tv ads to air in super tuesday states are up today in california and texas. in a 30-second ad aired in dallas and los angeles this morning for the first time, sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. that's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system, sanders says on camera.\n\ncbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. in another ad aired in dallas and san francisco, a narrator talks about sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care.\n\nour country is at a turning point. hard working people betrayed by trump struggling to survive, the narrator claims. in this moment, we need a fighter. bernie sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has, the voice concludes. according to kantar/cmag tracking, sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in california and more than $160,000 in texas through february 25th, but more ad buys are likely. on tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. super tuesday is march 3rd.\n\npresident trump\n\nthe trump campaign released one of two ads set to air during the super bowl on thursday, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. the 30-second ad released thursday morning called stronger, safer, more prosperous highlights the record unemployment numbers the united states has seen during the first three years of the trump administration. according to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game.\n\nandrew yang\n\nwith the iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around des moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. i think some campaigns have reached out to our team, andrew yang told reporters at an event yesterday, cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe reported.\n\na source close to the yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster that former vice president joe biden's campaign reached out about a deal. the rules of the iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. i frankly think i'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, yang said. in waukee today, biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former iowa governor tom vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to o'keefe.\n\nstate-by-state\n\ngeorgia\n\na popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a democrat in the special election for u.s. senate in georgia. cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson reports that reverend ralphael warnock, the pastor of martin luther king jr.'s ebenezer baptist church, announced his u.s. senate bid thursday in a twitter video. warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.\n\nmatt lieberman, the son of former senator joe lieberman, and ed tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the democratic nomination. nevertheless, warnock's entry could rally democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided republican party in the peach state.\n\nthe special election is being held to fill the seat held by former senator johnny isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. governor brian kemp appointed financial executive kelly loeffler to isakson's senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. loeffler will run in the special election in november to carry out the final two years of isakson's term, and she has the support of the national republican senatorial committee and the senate leadership fund. however, congressman doug collins announced his bid for the seat on wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the gop.\n\ndemocrats are targeting a number of house seats in georgia, as well as the state's two senate seats. georgia has been a republican stronghold for decades, but democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year.\n\ncongressional coverage\n\nin the house\n\nthe house democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro.\n\nin a meeting with reporters on thursday, democratic congressional campaign committee chair cheri bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the senate's inaction on the house's h.r. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nthe ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive democrat districts. bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. let's just remember the election is nine months off, bustos said. we want to make sure that going into november 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.\n\ndespite setting their own off-year record, the republican campaign arm was outraised by the dccc by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. two such members, joe cunningham of south carolina and anthony brindisi of new york, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside republican groups about impeachment.\n\nbustos, a democrat from a district won by mr. trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of democrats she says have compelling arguments. they've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. cindy axne's done 57 town hall meetings, joe cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…lauren underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. when you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. and i think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.\n\nbustos also said after he dropped out, beto o'rourke reached out to the dccc offering his help if needed. the dccc themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as senators kamala harris and cory booker and secretary julian castro, about potential involvement in the house election cycle. where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
the u.s. economy has thrown federal reserve policymakers a wicked curveball ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week: a sudden, unexpected slowdown in the pace of job gains was reported on friday.\n\nit wasn't supposed to be this way. for months, fed officials have responded to a surge in business confidence, consumer sentiment and stock market prices by preparing for further rate hikes this year. more recently, the fed has also openly discussed the process of tapering its $4 trillion-plus balance sheet swollen by years of bond-buying stimulus.\n\nbut now, with jobs slowing, auto sales braking and the economic data overall disappointing on a scale not seen since early 2015, the fed suddenly looks out of sync. while equities remain unshakable -- thanks mainly to a persistent bid in megacap tech stocks like amazon (amzn) -- other asset classes are responding: gold is rising, long-term interest rates are falling and the dollar is losing ground.\n\nalthough the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent last month (lowest since may 2001), it was the result of a reduction in the labor force. total payrolls grew just 138,000 vs. the 185,000 expected, which was below the lowest estimate. moreover, april and march job gains were revised lower by a net 66,000. it was an ugly showing.\n\nat this late hour, it's unlikely to keep the fed from raising rates by another quarter-point at its june meeting. indeed, futures market odds of a rate rise this month strengthened on friday's jobs news, rising to 94.6 percent from 92.3 percent prior. on may 5, the odds stood at 78.5 percent.\n\nbut for the rest of the year, the outlook for further rate hikes is dimming somewhat: the odds of a one-and-done at the june meeting, with the fed holding pat through the end of the year, rose to nearly 50 percent from just 37.7 percent a month ago.\n\ndeutsche bank economist joseph lavorgna doesn't believe the downshift in economic data is enough to completely derail the fed's current rate-hike policy, however, since it reflects the intense tightening underway in the labor market. this is not unlike what's happening in the housing market, where robust demand is being limited by scarce supply of homes for sale, lowering deal volume. simply too few qualified workers are in the labor force. thus, hiring is slowing.\n\nat time point, assuming the economic expansion continues, businesses will be forced to choose between continuing to forgo new hires (and limiting their ability to grow) or getting into a bidding war for the best workers by paying more. the latter would lead to the much-delayed, long-heralded boost to wage inflation -- and would deliver a much-needed salve to middle-class incomes.\n\nin response, lavorgna is looking not only for a hike this month and an unveiling of a balance-sheet tapering plan in september, but another quarter-point hike in december. that would push short-term interest rates to 1.5 percent.\n\nso far, stocks are agreeing with this optimistic outlook. but bonds, currencies and commodities are suggesting otherwise, pointing to a deflationary future reflective of a possible policy error by the fed.\n\nwe'll know more about where the economic data is pointing this week, with an update on labor productivity and costs on monday and job openings on tuesday.
president-elect joe biden introduced members of his science team on saturday. he says science will always be at the forefront of my administration, and is elevating the post of science adviser to cabinet level — a white house first.\n\nbiden said the scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts and the truth.\n\na pioneer in mapping the human genome — the book of life — is in line to be director of the office of science and technology policy and adviser on science. eric lander is the founding director of the broad institute of mit and harvard and was the lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome. he would be the first life scientist to have that white house job. his predecessor is a meteorologist.\n\nin accepting his nomination, lander said the opportunities we have, and the challenges we face, are greater than ever before, but stressed that no nation is better equipped to address these challenges because no nation is as diverse. no one can top america in that regard, lander said. but we have to make sure not only that everyone has a seat at the table, but a spot at the lab bench.\n\ndr. alondra nelson of the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, who mr. biden has picked to be deputy science policy chief, also emphasized the importance in expanding opportunities in the stem fields. as a black woman researcher, i am keenly aware of who is missing from these rooms, nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, said of her career.\n\nfrances arnold, a california institute of technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 nobel prize in chemistry, and mit vice president for research and geophysics professor maria zuber will lead the outside science advisory council. lander held that position during obama administration. zuber said she hopes to restore trust in science, and pursue breakthroughs that benefit all people.\n\nthe president-elect also said on friday he is retaining the director of the national institutes of health, dr. francis collins, who worked with lander on the human genome project. biden also is naming two prominent female scientists to co-chair the president's council of advisors on science and technology.\n\ncollins, in an email statement, called lander brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.\n\ni predict he will have a profound transformational effect on american science, collins said.\n\nthe job as director of science and technology policy requires senate confirmation.\n\nscience organizations were also quick to praise lander and the promotion of the science post.\n\nelevating (the science adviser) role to member in the president's cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion, said sudip parikh, chief executive officer of the american association for the advancement of science, the world's largest general scientific society.\n\nlander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both harvard and mit and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. he has won numerous science prizes, including a macarthur genius fellowship and a breakthrough prize, and is one of pope francis' scientific advisors.\n\nlander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his achilles' heel: i love teaching and more than that, i firmly believe that no matter what i do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that i could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.\n\nvice president-elect kamala harris said she was particularly excited about the administration's push to elevate science due to her upbringing. harris said her mother, an endocrinologist, lived by the scientific method, teaching her daughters that it's not a failure to reevaluate a hypothesis when the facts don't line up.\n\npresident-elect biden and i will not only listen to science, we will invest in it.\n\ncorrection: the associated press erroneously reported the institution for alondra nelson. she is a professor at the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, not at princeton university.
washington — the supreme court on monday allowed the trump administration to enforce its most ambitious effort yet to restrict legal immigration, giving u.s. officials the green light to implement a sweeping rule that critics warn will shut america's doors to low-income immigrants and people of color.\n\nin a 5-4 ruling, the conservative-leaning high court approved the trump administration's request to set aside a ruling by a federal judge blocking the so-called public charge regulation while the merits of the case continue to be argued in lower courts. the court's conservatives, including president trump's appointees, brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch, agreed to allow officials to enforce the policy, while the liberal justices would've denied the administration's request\n\nby dramatically expanding the definition of a public charge, or an economic burden on society, the u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) regulation unveiled in august gives officials more power to deny visas and green card applications from immigrants and prospective immigrants whom the government determines rely, or could rely, on certain public benefits like food stamps and government housing programs.\n\nfor decades, the u.s. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge on the country, but the new rule scraps clinton-era guidance that said only the use of cash benefits could be analyzed by immigration caseworkers.\n\nthe trump administration has defended the new restrictions as a way to ensure immigrants are self-sufficient. but opponents believe the policy is an attempt by the white house to circumvent laws passed by congress by instituting what's essentially a wealth test designed to limit the immigration of poorer people from developing countries.\n\nif you listen to trump talking about how he wants a points-based immigration system and wants people who are wealthier, better educated, higher skilled and not from countries he's spoken of in derogatory, profane language — this is it. this is the policy that aims to do that, without congress approving it whatsoever, said doug rand, a former white house official under president obama who co-founded boundless, a company to help immigrants navigate the u.s. immigration system.\n\nit's a way to screen out people, not just from developing countries, but from any country, that the government has decided aren't wealthy enough, aren't healthy enough and don't speak english well enough, rand added.\n\nsoon after its final version was published last summer, the public charge rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge calling it repugnant to the american dream. however, in recent weeks, circuit courts lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions against it, leaving only an order by a federal judge in new york standing.\n\nearlier in january, the justice department asked the supreme court to set aside the remaining nationwide injunction — a request that has now been granted. u.s. immigration officials will now be able to implement the new restrictions in every part of the country other than illinois, where the rule is still blocked under a statewide injunction.\n\nin a concurring opinion joined by justice clarence thomas, gorsuch expressed profound concerns about lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions that transcend the cases before them. he said both the government and those suing it are rushing through cases with national implications in the hopes of obtaining emergency rulings, instead of methodically developing arguments.\n\nthe routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions, gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion.\n\nken cuccinelli, an immigration hawk and the second highest-ranking official at the department of homeland security, said his department is making preparations to enforce the public charge policy following the supreme court's decision.\n\nself-sufficiency and self-reliance are key american values not to be litigiously dismissed, but to be encouraged and adopted by the next generation of immigrants, cuccinelli said in a statement monday evening. we plan to fully implement this rule in 49 states and are confident we will win the case on the merits.\n\nexpanding the definition of public charge\n\nthe term dates back to 1882, when the u.s. was trying to limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. the year it was first codified, the u.s. also enacted the discriminatory chinese exclusion act, which barred the entry of most chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities.\n\nin the late 1990s, the clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant might be a public charge. the trump administration's policy substantially expands this term by broadening the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the u.s.\n\nunder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), certain federally funded medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including section 8 vouchers.\n\nofficials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. on certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nto determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their wealth, age, educational skills, english language proficiency and health. since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they aren't u.s. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.\n\nthis regulation is not about public benefits, except insofar as it's scaring people to stay away from public benefits — even when they don't have to, said rand, the former obama official.\n\nwhat the rule really does is it imposes a 25-factor test that's never been done before, that congress has never authorized, that is going to make it less likely for someone to get a green card based on their age, their income, their heath, the number of children they have, whether they have a mortgage or student loans and a whole bunch of other things that have nothing to do with public benefits, he added.\n\nimmigrant advocates are concerned about the effects the rule could have on people who are technically not subject to it. researchers have documented a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that have prompted some fearful immigrant families, including families that include u.s. citizens, to drop out of benefits programs.\n\nthe stringent requirements proposed by the public charge rule are not the only moves the administration has taken to impose limits on legal immigration.\n\nin october, the white house issued a proclamation allowing the government to reject visa applications from would-be immigrants it determines won't be able to cover their medical costs. the plan, which is still being held up in court, could deny entry to approximately 375,000 prospective immigrants each year, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan migration policy institute.\n\na proposed rule by uscis published in november would hike petition fees for immigrants seeking u.s. citizenship, for young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers trying to renew protections from deportation and for victims of crimes who are seeking to stay in the country through their assistance to law enforcement. the proposal would also make the u.s. one of only four nations that require asylum-seekers fleeing persecution to pay a fee to file affirmative requests for protection.\n\njan crawford contributed reporting.
u.s. equities drifted lower on friday as buyer exhaustion set in after an exciting week.\n\ncooling investors' ardor were mixed tech earnings, lingering disappointment with president donald trump's tax proposal from wednesday, a lack of progress on health insurance reform and worries about a potential government shutdown. but above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak initial reading of first-quarter u.s. gdp. growth came in at just 0.7 percent as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009.\n\nbut the stock market's losses were really quite modest, with nasdaq even pushing to a new intraday high at the open. wall street, it seems, tried to focus on the silver linings in the report ahead of another busy week of economic reports and a federal reserve moneary policy decision on wednesday.\n\nthe gdp report sure wasn't pretty: growth slowed from the 2.1 percent pace set in 2016's fourth quarter to its worst pace in three years (chart below). personal consumption increased just 0.3 percent following a 3.5 percent expansion in the previous quarter, which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. inventories were a drag.\n\nbright spots included nonresidential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending, especially in the mining sector) and residential investment, which increased at a 13.7 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate for its second straight quarter of very strong gains. the export gap also narrowed, slightly.\n\npaul ashworth, chief u.s. economist at capital economics, doesn't believe the weak first-quarter performance will keep the fed from hiking rates again in june. aside from the silver linings outlined above, he noted a tendency for weakness in first quarters that seasonal adjustments haven't fully accommodated. since 2011, the average growth rate for the quarter is just 0.9 percent vs. 2.4 percent in each of the other three.\n\nanother likely drag was unseasonably warm weather, which reduced consumer spending for utilities.\n\noverall, ihs markit expects full-year 2017 gdp growth to come in around 2.5 percent, led by the double-digit gain in residential investment, the best growth in five quarters.\n\nwe'll know more when the fed holds its policy meeting on wednesday, may 3, and when the latest jobs numbers are released next friday. also coming are updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry) and fresh data on labor costs and productivity.
u.s. commandos have captured a chemical weapons expert for the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis), cbs news national security correspondent david martin reports.\n\nthe capture has led to at least one strike in iraq's second largest city, mosul, which was designed to destroy a building where mustard gas munitions were believed to be manufactured. there are 12 reported instances of isis using mustard gas on the battlefield.\n\nit's the first known major success of washington's more aggressive policy of pursuing the jihadis on the ground.\n\nthe obama administration launched the new strategy in december, deploying a commando force to iraq that it said would be dedicated to capturing and killing isis leaders in clandestine operations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.\n\nu.s. officials said last week that the expeditionary team had captured an isis leader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for two or three weeks and was being questioned.\n\nthe two iraqi officials identified the man to the associated press as sleiman daoud al-afari, who worked for saddam hussein's now-dissolved military industrialization authority where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. they said al-afari, who is about 50 years old, heads isis' recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.\n\nhe was captured in a raid near the northern iraqi town of tal afar, the officials said. they would not give further details.\n\nthe officials, who both have first-hand knowledge of the individual and of the isis chemical program, spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to brief the media.\n\nthe u.s.-led coalition began targeting isis' chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids over the past two months, the iraqi intelligence officials and a western security official in baghdad told the ap.\n\nairstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials said. they and the western official spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.\n\nisis has been making a determined effort to develop chemical weapons, iraqi and american officials have said. it is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons research, made up of iraqi scientists from the saddam-era weapons program as well as foreign experts. iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the effort because isis gained so much room to operate and hide chemical laboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of 2014, joined with territory they controlled in neighboring syria.\n\nstill, its progress has been limited. it is believed to have created limited amounts of mustard gas. tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in syria when isis was launching attacks there in august 2015. other unverified reports in both iraq and syria accuse isis of using chemical agents on the battlefield.\n\nbut so far, experts say, the extremist group appears incapable of launching a large-scale chemical weapons attack, which requires not only expertise, but also the proper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to produce enough of the chemical agent to pose a significant threat.\n\nmore than a symbolic attack seems to me to be beyond the grasp of isis, said dan kaszeta, a former u.s. army chemical officer and department of homeland security expert who is now a private consultant. furthermore, the chemicals we are talking about are principally chlorine and sulfur mustard, both of which are actually quite poor weapons by modern standards.\n\nthe united states has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against isis in iraq and syria for more than a year. the campaign has been key to backing iraqi and kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.\n\nbut after coming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the obama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on the ground.\n\nlast year, u.s. special forces killed a key isis leader and captured his wife in a raid in syria, but the new force in iraq was intended as a more dedicated deployment. american officials have been deeply secretive about the operation. its size is unknown, though it may be fewer than 100 troops.\n\nthis is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things, was about all defense secretary ash carter would say about the force in testimony to the senate armed services committee in december.
the louisville metro police department has formally fired two of the officers involved in the march police raid that killed emergency medical worker breonna taylor. louisville mayor greg fischer confirmed the firings wednesday and cbs news obtained copies of the termination letters.\n\nthe department last week sent pre-termination letters to detective myles cosgrove, who an fbi analysis determined fired the shot that killed taylor, and detective josh jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at taylor's louisville home. in the letter to jaynes obtained by cbs news, interim police chief yvette gentry said jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a u.s. postal inspector that taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at taylor's home.\n\nlouisville police detectives myles cosgrove, left, and joshua jaynes, right, were involved in the fatal shooting of breonna taylor. lmpd\n\nthe raid was linked to a drug investigation into the ex-boyfriend, jamarcus glover, who did not live there. kenneth walker, taylor's boyfriend, said police did not announce themselves before they battered in the door and he fired a shot because he feared someone was trying to break in. three officers including cosgrove returned fire, killing taylor. no drugs were found in the home.\n\ncosgrove was fired for violating the department's deadly force policy, according to a termination letter obtained by cbs news.\n\nanother officer who opened fire, brett hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into taylor's apartment from outside. he was charged criminally with endangering taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. no one has been charged in taylor's death. kentucky attorney general daniel cameron said cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, sergeant jon mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by walker.\n\nboth cosgrove and jaynes will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nin the termination letter, gentry cited cosgrove's statements to internal investigators in which he described seeing a distorted shadowy mass and flashes of big light. gentry said the statements made it clear that cosgrove did not properly identify a threat, as department policy requires, before firing 16 shots.\n\nthe shots you fired went in three different directions, indicating you did not verify a threat or have target acquisition, gentry wrote. in other words, the evidence shows that you fired wildly at unidentified subjects or targets located within an apartment.\n\ngentry wrote that mattingly, who was shot in the thigh by walker, was able to identify and describe the individual whom he targeted as a threat and against whom he returned fire.\n\ngentry wrote in a dec. 30 letter to mattingly that he had been exonerated after an investigation into whether he violated the department's use of force and de-escalation policies.\n\nin her letter to cosgrove, gentry wrote the detective failed to follow procedure when he didn't activate his body camera. gentry said cosgrove had attempted to explain his actions during a pre-termination meeting by referencing information about the effects an imminent threat can have on an officer's performance. but she wrote, i cannot justify your conduct or in good conscience recommend anything less than termination.\n\nbreonna taylor and kenneth walker\n\ncosgrove's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cbs news.\n\nin a termination letter to jaynes, gentry wrote that jaynes did not independently confirm with a u.s. postal inspector that glover had been receiving packages at taylor's home, as he claimed in a search warrant affidavit he filed with a judge.\n\ni acknowledge that you believe you prepared the search warrant in good faith, gentry wrote. however, you failed to inform the judge you had no contact with the u.s. postal inspector. your sworn information was not only inaccurate, it was not truthful.\n\nthomas clay, an attorney for jaynes, confirmed the termination but couldn't provide more information. last week, clay disputed the allegations that jaynes lied on the search warrant application.\n\nthe news of the firings came the same day the fischer announced that erika shields, the former chief of the atlanta police department, has been chosen as the next chief of the louisville metro police department. shields will be the fourth person to lead the department since taylor's death. she will be sworn is as chief on jan. 19.\n\nsome in the community took to social media to decry the selection of shields, who stepped down from her position in atlanta after one of her officers fatally shot rayshard brooks, a black man, during a june arrest in a wendy's parking lot. the officer, garrett rolfe, was fired and charged with counts including felony murder.\n\nfischer said shields stepped down from her position in atlanta so the community there could heal, and described her as a leader committed to reform. speaking wednesday, shields said the louisville department is at a crossroads and believes it can become a model for other departments across the country. the department is undergoing a review of all police practices that's expected to be complete by the end of the month, reports cbs station wlky.\n\ni commit to begin my work here with a focus on rebuilding community trust, trust that i believe was already eroding prior to breonna taylor's killing, shields said.\n\ncostanza maio

the food stamp program will be funded through february should the government shutdown continue, the trump administration says.\n\nagriculture secretary sonny perdue is asking states to issue the february benefits on or before jan. 20 so that they can be paid to the nearly 40 million americans in the program. snap is already fully funded for january.\n\nrecipients of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, also known as food stamps, had been at risk of having their assistance disrupted next month because of the shutdown.\n\nthe administration announced its plans as the white house worked to limit republican defections on spending bills in the house this week, which democratic leaders have scheduled in hopes of driving a wedge between gop lawmakers on the shutdown. democrats set a vote for thursday on the agriculture bill, which is largely made up of payments for food stamps, knowing that it would put pressure on republicans to abandon their leaders and vote for the measure.\n\na disruption in food stamp benefits is cause for very substantial concern, wrote dottie rosenbaum, senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities, a left-leaning think tank, on monday. many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship.\n\nthat would put more pressure on food banks and local charities to provide food and assistance to poor families, she noted. more than 250,000 supermarkets, grocery stores and other retailers that accept food stamps would see a significant drop in snap redemptions, which can contribute a large share of sales, she added.\n\nshort-term funding bill\n\nthe usda said it can fund snap through february thanks to the short-term funding bill that ran out on dec. 22. that bill included a provision giving federal agencies the authority to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.\n\nbrandon lipps, an acting deputy undersecretary, said other usda programs will also be funded through february, including school lunches, food distribution programs on indian reservations and child nutrition programs. the latter includes wic, which provides nutritional assistance to pregnant women, mothers and babies.\n\nunder the provision, the snap program will operate as it normally does and without any lapse in service, but with an earlier deadline for states to request benefits through a process called early issuance. that process is typically used during natural disasters, lipps said, enabling states anticipating hurricanes or other weather events to distribute monthly benefits ahead of time.\n\nlipps said the usda is sending letters to all state agencies to explain the process and will issue a blanket waiver of department regulations to allow for the early issuance.\n\nwe know this is a time of great uncertainty, and no doubt anxiety for people who rely on snap and are dealing with tough times, lipps said. i hope it's reassuring for us to make clear today that we're committed to maintaining service to snap clients without interruption to the extent possible under the law.\n\n$3 billion contingency fund\n\nthe snap program will cost roughly $4.8 billion for february, and those funds have already been appropriated through the expired spending bill. but if the shutdown lasts until march, the usda could be forced to dip into its reserves to help fund the program, and its $3 billion snap contingency fund won't cover a full month of benefits.\n\nperdue is a strong proponent of scaling back the snap program, and publicly supported a gop house measure to strengthen work requirements for food stamp recipients. the measure garnered no support in the senate and didn't make it into the final farm bill, which president donald trump signed into law in december.\n\nthe trump administration has announced its intent to try and limit snap use through regulation, crafting a proposal to limit the ability of states to waive the program's work requirements.
the shortlist for amazon's (amzn) second headquarters is out, with the online retail giant releasing a list of the top 20 contenders on thursday.\n\ngetting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity, holly sullivan of amazon public policy said in a statement. through this process we learned about many new communities across north america that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\n\nseattle-based amazon said it received 238 proposals from cities and regions hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters.\n\nthe list:\n\n\n\n\n\natlanta, georgia\n\n\n\naustin, texas\n\n\n\nboston, massachusetts\n\n\n\nchicago, illinois\n\n\n\ncolumbus, ohio\n\n\n\ndallas, texas\n\n\n\ndenver, colorado\n\n\n\nindianapolis, indiana\n\n\n\nlos angeles, california\n\n\n\nmiami, florida\n\n\n\nmontgomery county, maryland\n\nnashville, tennessee\n\n\n\nnewark, new jersey\n\n\n\nnew york city\n\n\n\nnorthern virginia\n\n\n\nphiladelphia, pennsylvania\n\n\n\npittsburgh, pennsylvania\n\n\n\nraleigh, north carolina\n\n\n\ntoronto, ontario\n\n\n\nwashington, d.c.\n\n\n\nthe announcement came the day after tech titan apple (aapl) said it will build a second corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers in a $350 billion, five-year commitment to the u.s. economy. the company has not announced a chosen city; apple's main headquarters is in cupertino, calif.\n\namazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in september, promising to bring 50,000 new jobs and spend up to $5 billion. proposals from cities, states and regions were due last week, and amazon made clear that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor on where it chooses to land.\n\nthe company has said the second headquarters, dubbed hq2, will be a full equal to its seattle home.\n\nleaders in pennsylvania hailed the inclusion of philadelphia and pittsburgh on the list of finalists. gov. tom wolf said he wasn't surprised, given pennsylvania's location in the heart of the east coast along with its nationally ranked educational institutions and a workforce equipped to support future growth.\n\nboth pittsburgh and philadelphia have a real shot, and we will continue to support these locations by making the case to amazon that pennsylvania is a unique and tremendous place to build a business, make a home, and pursue your happiness, wolf said.\n\nofficials in some metro areas that didn't make the cut expressed disappointment.\n\nnew hampshire's groundbreaking proposal to recruit amazon was the most comprehensive business marketing plan our state has ever produced, gov. chris sununu said in a statement. while we always knew that our bid was considered a long shot, we are excited that it is already serving as a template for other businesses that now have new hampshire on their radar.\n\nnew hampshire's amazon proposal was centered in londonderry and emphasized the state's lack of a sales or income tax.\n\nmemphis, tennessee, mayor jim strickland said the state gave it out best shot, while expressing confidence that the process will help it attract other businesses.\n\nthe city offered amazon $60 million in cash incentives.
president-elect joe biden's proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage would provide an urgently pay hike to millions of low-income workers and help stem inequality in the u.s., economists and labor advocates said.\n\nin detailing his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief proposal on thursday, mr. biden called for raising the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, saying, no one working 40 hours a week should still be below the poverty line.\n\na fatter paycheck could help many americans regain their financial footing during the ongoing recovery, including essential workers such as grocery clerks and home health aides whose jobs have put them on the front lines of a pandemic yet whose earnings are among the lowest.\n\nevery worker should be paid a $15 minimum wage, and essential front-line workers need hazard pay for the enormous health and safety risks they face during this pandemic, marc perrone, international president of the united food and commercial workers, told cbs moneywatch in a statement. the union represents 1.3 million retail, grocery and other workers.\n\nthe incoming biden administration's plans to hike pay also reflects a dramatically shifting political landscape — one that could finally bear fruit for low-paid workers and grassroots activists who for years have pushed for better pay and working conditions as part of the influential fight for $15 campaign.\n\nthe labor movement's success can be seen in minimum wage hikes in 20 states this year, with another four states and washington, d.c., also set to raise their baseline pay later this year. in florida, meanwhile, voters in december narrowly approved a measure to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.\n\nsame federal wage since 2009\n\nthe federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, hasn't budged since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was passed in 1938. according to the u.s. department of labor, as of 2019 (the latest year for which data is available) 392,000 american workers were earning $7.25 an hour; another 1.2 million earned even less (tipped workers are among those exempt from the $7.25 minimum.)\n\noverall, roughly 2% of all u.s. workers who are paid hourly earn $7.25 or less, government data show. hiking the national minimum to $15 an hour by 2025 would lift 1.3 million workers above wages that put them below the poverty line, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office.\n\nthe cbo also estimated the move would cost 1.3 million american jobs, a claim long made by conservative economists. mr. biden's call to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour is the absolute last thing that unemployed workers need right now, michael farren, an economist with the right-leaning mercatus center at george mason university, said in an email. after all, they can't benefit from higher wages if those higher wages result in slower job growth.\n\nheidi shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the left-leaning economic policy institute, rejects the argument that a wage hike would lead to job losses.\n\nthat claim of job loss isn't supported by evidence — it's likely an overestimate of negative employment impact. but even if you accept their findings, they still find the benefits far outweigh the costs, shierholz, formerly the labor department's chief economist under barack obama, told cbs moneywatch.\n\nhigher labor costs from raising the minimum wage would be shouldered by businesses, some of which would pass them on to consumers, according to the cbo.\n\nthe loss in business income would be mostly borne by families well above the poverty line. all consumers would pay higher prices, but higher-income families, who spend more, would pay more of these costs, the cbo stated in a 2019 report.\n\nthere's no question that this would reduce inequality and reduce poverty by shifting money from corporate profits to low-wage workers, shierholz said. biden has made it very clear that his economic plans are really centering on racial justice and gender economic justice. we know women and men of color are likely to be at the low end of wage distribution.\n\nalthough labor groups cheered mr. biden's push for higher wages, the proposal's political path is uncertain. democrats could try to pass mr. biden's broader relief plan under budget reconciliation rules that skirt the senate's 60-vote requirement.\n\nbut non-budget related items are prohibited from reconciliation, which means items like a minimum wage increase could not be included in a reconciliation measure, according to brian gardner, chief washington policy analyst at investment bank stifel nicolaus.\n\ndemocrats in the house are expected in coming weeks to reintroduce a version of the raise the wage act that passed in the chamber two years ago, but never gained traction in the republican-controlled senate.
salt lake city -- the mormon church said tuesday it will sever all ties with the boy scouts of america at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. the move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nthe announcement by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and boy scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\njoining the boy scouts is practically automatic among mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states. the mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nthe mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nthe boy scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to scouts bsa to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nlike other conservative faiths, the mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. the church initially said it was deeply troubled by the boy scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nthe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nthe mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of god.\n\nthe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to boy scouts, but it won't be modeled after boy scouts or use ranks. the 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the boy scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nmore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the u.s. and canada.\n\nthe boy scouts of america in a statement thanked the thousands of mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. the organization said individual mormons who wish to stay in boy scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nthe boy scouts' move to allow girls, announced last october, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nthe organization already has started allowing girls into the cub scouts. so far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 cub scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled scout me in.\n\nthough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the boy scouts of america, and the cub scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nthe boy scout movement had been entrenched in mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nin 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in salt lake city to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the boy scouts.\n\na boy scout training complex in west virginia is named after former mormon church president thomas s. monson, a longtime member of the boy scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
a four-year college degree has long been seen as the ticket to a better life. these days, though, it may be your ticket to a job as a file clerk, at least initially.\n\naccording a national survey by careerbuilder, 41 percent of employers are hiring college grads for jobs that were once held largely by those with only a high school education. that figure is up from 37 percent of companies that reported doing so in a careerbuilder survey released last year.\n\nand in turn, workers with bachelor's degrees have lost ground to those with greater credentials. careerbuilder also reported that 33 percent of employers are hiring more workers with master's degrees for jobs that used to be held largely by those with bachelor's degrees, up from 27 percent in the previous survey.\n\nwhy do employers continue to raise the educational bar? because they can.\n\nwhile the labor market has improved significantly since the great recession, it's still chock-full of job seekers who have college degrees but not necessarily the skills in highest demand, including science, technology, engineering and math (stem).\n\nin fact, careerbuilder reported that more than half of employers that are hiring workers with college degrees to fill jobs traditionally held by high school grads said they could do so because of the current labor market.\n\nemployers are certainly willing, in this excessive [labor] supply situation, to hire people who might appear to be overqualified, said david passmore, a professor in the workforce education and development program at pennsylvania state university.\n\nsaddled with high levels of student loan debt, many college grads feel they may have no choice but to take whatever job they can get. that might help to explain why wages for the college educated haven't climbed all that much during the recovery: about half of college grads earn less now than they did in 2000. median earnings for college grads stood at $24.99 per hour in 2016, about 1.5 percent less than they earned in 2000, according to a study by the economic policy institute (epi).\n\nthe labor market is in a funky condition, said passmore. we have lower unemployment, but at the same time we have not had any real wage growth. even though people are being hired, many are willing to accept a lower wage to get into the labor market, he added.\n\nof course, careerbuilder's findings are even more disillusioning for those with just a high school degree. not only are they losing jobs to workers with more education, but the pay gap between college-educated workers and high school grads has never been larger. on average, college grads earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to an epi study. that was the largest such gap in epi's figures dating back to 1973.\n\non the bright side, some of the fasting-growing jobs in the u.s. require technical skills, such as computer coding, but not necessarily a four-year college degree, explained passmore. in 2015, as many as 7 million job openings required coding skills, according to a report from analytics firm burning glass.\n\npeople with high school-level skills are being hollowed out of the labor market, said passmore. he added, if you have a high school diploma without technical skills, you will be in a long line of people waiting for jobs.
atlanta -- a white police officer in the greater atlanta area who told a black driver i don't care about your people has resigned, authorities said friday.\n\npolice in suburban cobb county on friday released officer maurice lawson's resignation letter, which arose from a traffic stop in november. the letter was dated a day earlier and submitted to chief john houser.\n\nwe accepted his resignation effective today, houser said in a statement.\n\nlawson had recently been suspended without pay for two weeks after completing a 16-hour training class on de-escalation.\n\nattorney lance lorusso said friday lawson believed that the current media attention and the scrutiny anticipated upon his return to duty would have proved to be an unnecessary distraction to him, and the men and women of the cobb county police department, cbs affiliate wgcl reported.\n\nthe president of the fraternal order of police lodge #13 created a gofundme account to raise money for officer lawson and his family following his suspension. some of the donors who have given money are fellow officers, wgcl said.\n\nin dashcam video of the nov. 16 incident, lawson gives motorist brian baker two citations. lawson then says on video, leave. go away. go to fulton county. atlanta is in neighboring fulton county.\n\nlawson wrote in response to houser's jan. 15 memo that he said i don't care about you people, not your people. he also wrote that there was no racial motivation behind his comments, but that he had lost his temper when baker was uncooperative during the stop.\n\nin the video, lawson can then be heard asking baker whether he wants to get out of the car to talk with him. houser wrote in the memo to lawson that those words could be seen as an invitation for a possible altercation. lawson then continued to engage in heated conversation with baker, houser wrote.\n\nafter baker drove off, lawson was visibly upset, used profanities and could be saying, i lose my cool every time.\n\nauthorities said the officer's statements raised concerns it might not have been an isolated incident and led officials to conduct random reviews of video from his other traffic stops and order a fitness for duty evaluation by a physician.\n\nhouser said that lawson immediately recognized his behavior was contrary to policy and reported his own actions before any investigation had begun -- and before there was any media attention.\n\nlawson was given a jan. 4 memo from the deputy police chief that proposed the two-week suspension without pay and 20-hours of verbal defense and influence training.\n\nhouser said the department of public safety's code of conduct demands that officers show courtesy and tact and that they control their temper.\n\nwe will be reiterating the importance of courtesy and compliance with policy to our members since unbecoming conduct reflects discredit upon the individual and the department and will not be tolerated, houser said.\n\nlawson also had been ordered to attend 20 additional hours of training on verbal defense in march.\n\nbut houser said in preparation for his return to active duty with a field training officer, we reviewed additional videos and additional policy issues were discovered.\n\nhouser didn't offer more details regarding the discovered policy issues.\n\nthe atlanta journal-constitution reported lawson was also involved in an incident last summer in which he followed county commissioner lisa cupid, which led the african american commissioner to accuse him of racial profiling. lawson was cleared of wrong-doing in the cupid case.\n\nmessages to lawyers of lawson and baker were not immediately returned.
democrats on the house intelligence committee have wasted no time in beefing up the investigative staff dedicated to continuing the committee's work on its semi-dormant russia probe, even as the committee's new membership is still taking shape.\n\nthe new majority has made offers to half a dozen new staffers, cbs news has learned, and is still searching for six more. among the latest hires are an expert in corruption and illicit finance and a former prosecutor.\n\nthe committee typically does not reveal much publicly about its staff; it is withholding names and most details about potential new hires as some of them progress through a lengthy security clearance process.\n\nthere's a lot of work yet to be done on russia, a senior committee official told cbs news. what we're doing is we are creating a purpose-built team that will take the point on that.\n\nas they assume the majority, democrats under newly appointed chairman adam schiff, d-calif., will add four members to the committee and more than double its staff, from 11 to roughly 24; republicans will cut their staff count and, with some members having retired from congress last year, likely keep their membership even at nine.\n\nabout seven of the democrats' new staffers will be dedicated full-time to the committee's residual work investigating alleged connections between president trump, his campaign associates, and russian officials – while a handful of other staffers will be available to assist in that investigation on a surge basis, committee officials say.\n\nthough republicans on the committee declared an end to the russia probe last spring and issued a final report finding no collusion on the part of the president's campaign, democrats have long decried the findings as fundamentally unserious, and vowed to keep parts of the inquiry open.\n\nschiff said in an interview last month that the committee had been deluged with résumés from candidates hoping to join its staff.\n\nthe new staff additions are intended to enhance the committee's ability to make inroads on unanswered questions in the russia investigation without requiring it to pivot away from the day job of overseeing the intelligence community's 17 organizations, according to committee officials. but the final team will likely bring with it the investigative and prosecutorial specialties schiff has long sought.\n\nas ranking member, the california democrat consistently lamented being hamstrung by a republican majority which, under then-chairman devin nunes, d-calif., seemed at best incurious about certain aspects of the trump-russia nexus. schiff has also been publicly wistful about the special counsel's investigative horsepower, telling an audience at the council of foreign relations last february that he was deeply jealous of the team mueller had assembled.\n\ni have a phenomenal staff, he said at the time, they're bright and they work 24/7, seven days a week and they do it with no windows.\n\n[b]ut they're largely analysts, schiff continued, they're not trained to be investigators.\n\nthe team now tasked with resuscitating the russia investigation is not expected to start from scratch, but instead to zero in on some complex financial and legal questions whose answers have largely eluded house investigators.\n\nunlike in the last congress, when the investigation was undertaken by existing oversight staff, chairman schiff will now have a team better able to answer the key questions about trump's relationship with [russian president vladimir] putin and his cronies, the senior committee official said.\n\nschiff and some of his fellow committee democrats have been transparent about what some of their immediate priorities will be. they include the release to the special counsel -- and subsequently to the public -- of all of the committee's russia investigation interview transcripts; subpoenaing relevant banking and telecommunications records that democrats have said contain information that implicates the president; and hearing – in some cases a second time – from key witnesses.\n\namong the witnesses in which the democrats have expressed an interest are the president's personal lawyer, michael cohen, family members like donald trump jr. and jared kushner, and other former trump campaign officials, like george papadopoulos and michael flynn, who have cooperated with the special counsel.\n\ndemocrats have also telegraphed a voracious appetite for new avenues of inquiry, including the trump organization's reported offer of a $50 million condo in trump tower moscow to putin and the notes taken by the interpreter present at the two leaders' one-on-one meeting last july.\n\nwhile schiff has also previously mentioned the potential for coordination between his committee and that of the senate intelligence committee, whose own investigation will enter its second year later this month, aides from both indicated the change in leadership would not necessarily pave the way for collaboration, and that the two investigations will remain separate.\n\nas these new priorities come to the fore, schiff has also vowed restore both comity and sobriety to the committee – though there are no indications that he and nunes, who will now serve as ranking member, have reestablished lines of communication, let alone decided on an amicable path forward.\n\nin fact, republicans on the committee are generally skeptical that the majority, under schiff, will make a concerted effort to resume normal oversight work as long as the russia investigation remains a chief focus.\n\na republican committee official said democrats were adopting a posture of show me the man and i'll show you the crime vis-a-vis president trump – an apparent reference to the ruthless and manipulative tactics of the former head of the soviet secret police under joseph stalin.\n\nin a statement, the spokesman for the committee's republican minority, jack langer, said, for months, the committee's democrats have shown that their principal priority is to launch a sprawling investigation of trump and to try to manufacture a basis for impeachment.\n\nso republicans will focus on doing the oversight of the intelligence community that this committee was created to do, and will be pointing out the absurdity of the democrats' myriad conspiracy theories, langer said.\n\nrestructuring\n\nthe day-to-day work of oversight is also evolving with the democrats taking the reins.\n\nwhile parts of the committee's operations and structure are virtually always tweaked by the incoming majority – nunes, as chairman, put in place a mostly agency-specific subcommittee structure, with groups dedicated to the cia, nsa and defense intelligence in particular – under schiff, the four existing subcommittees will also be reorganized.\n\nrather than keeping the subcommittees focused on specific agencies, they will be restructured around thematic challenges – or core missions – across the intelligence community, according to officials familiar with the committee's plans.\n\none subcommittee will focus on crucial and increasingly competitive technologies at the heart of the intelligence enterprise, including satellites and other space-based assets, advanced and quantum computing, and challenges like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\na second will oversee the intelligence community's counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts – including those in hotspots like north korea and iran – as well as counterintelligence. the third will look at the overall management of the intelligence community, with an emphasis on human capital management, information technology, and security clearance reform. the last will focus on intelligence community's support to the american military and the pentagon.\n\n[t]hese subcommittees will be empowered to devise and execute their own oversight plans through hearings, deep dives, and travel to [intelligence community] elements at home and abroad, schiff said in a statement provided to cbs news.\n\nit sounds to me like a sensible division of labor over four subcommittees and i don't think the agencies will feel like they're overlooked, said michael allen, a former majority staff director under republican chairman mike rogers, r-mich.\n\nthe technologies subcommittee in particular makes a lot of sense, said allen, who also served on former president george w. bush's national security council. that topic – especially as china continues stealing critical technology – remains a major concern in the national security community.\n\nmark lowenthal, who also served as staff director to former republican chairman larry combest, agreed. this array is more likely to lead to effective oversight, he said. while there are agency-specific problems, a lot of issues that you worry about – whether you are managing or overseeing – transcend the intelligence agencies, across the board.\n\nlowenthal, who also served in policy and management roles in the executive branch as vice chairman of the national intelligence council and as an assistant director of central intelligence, said the new structure will likely provide the committee with more visibility into the intelligence community's most urgent challenges.\n\none of the things people always complain about in the intelligence community is 'stovepipes,' he said. well, if you set up committees on an agency basis you replicate those stovepipes.\n\nthis seems a much better way to get a sense of what's going on and where congress can help figure out what needs doing, lowenthal said.\n\nthe committee, once it is fully constituted, will still need to vote in order to finalize the new structure and assign new subcommittee chairs.\n\nfrom there, other business items, both regular and extraordinary, and ranging from the release of dozens of witness transcripts, to the issuance of subpoenas, to standard open hearings, are expected to be put in motion later this month or in early february.\n\nit is unclear if nunes, who for a time stepped away from the committee's russia investigation amid an ethics investigation, will participate in the committee's witness interviews, once they recommence.
the following is a transcript of the interview with former special presidential envoy brett mcgurk that aired sunday, jan. 20, 2019, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'd like to now welcome brett mcgurk. he was president trump's envoy to the global coalition fighting isis, but he resigned last month in protest following the president's decision to withdraw from syria. in an op-ed this week, he warned america's decision to pull out is giving the terror group new life. brett, thank you for being here.\n\nbrett mcgurk: thanks for having me margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: the vice president sat here and reiterated that isis is defeated. is he correct?\n\nbrett mcgurk: well they're not defeated. i've been- i've been part of this campaign for four years across two administrations. we've come a- an extraordinarily long way. and in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million syrians and iraqis. it was committing genocide against christians and yazidis and minority groups. it was planning attacks against us in the homeland. it was carrying them out in paris, that killed americans in brussels and paris. we've come a long way. we have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of isis. what that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. and what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. so as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in syria for some time. and on instructions from the white house, we were telling them, we'd stay in syria until we completed the enduring defeat of isis, not just the physical territory. we'd stay in syria until the iranians left syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in geneva to end the ultimate civil war. we had told that to our partners on the ground. we had told that to our coalition partners and it was reversed in a conversation between the president and a foreign leader. leadership- american leadership really counts. leadership built this coalition. it led to these gains against isis. and leadership requires some presence on the ground and also consistency. and it was the total reversal of our policy that made it- i just i concluded i could not be effective in carrying out those new instructions.\n\nmargaret brennan: we should point out, you joined the state department under president bush. you then served under president obama and then under president trump. can you clarify there, i point that out because you serve democrats and republicans. why did you resign specifically?\n\nmcgurk: well again look i- look--\n\nmargaret brennan: the president has alleged it's political.\n\nmcgurk: well i've- i've served all three administrations. i've worked on policies that i fully supported. you work on policies here in the government that you might not support. you argue your case. in this case, i think the entire national security team had one view, and the president in a conversation with president erdoğan just completely reversed the policy. you know the president has said, i think he's right, you never- you never telegraph a punch when you're in a military campaign. you also don't telegraph your retreat. i've probably traveled to syria more than any other american civilian official. i know our people in syria. i- my heart is broken and we're all- our thoughts are with the families and loved ones that were just killed. in this campaign in syria since 2015, we've had two americans killed in action. we built this campaign plan, to answer for those who believe that we should not be over invested in these confl- conflicts. americans are not fighting. we built a force of 60,000 syrians to do the fighting. american taxpayers are not spending money on civilian stabilization or reconstruction costs. the coalition is doing that. so it was a sustainable campaign plan and we had in- the pieces in place, as we defeat the physical caliphate, to begin a very serious negotiation with some pretty hostile actors in syria, including russia. and we had worked with the russians diplomatically basically to draw lines on the map at the euphrates river and we said, look you don't cross that river. if you cross that river we'll kill you.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we- have we have a map we can put up just so people understand that what you're saying is- is actually having a real world impact on the ground what president trump did. and possibly lose the territory that the u.s. has cleared out?\n\nmcgurk: well the minute you say- the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations. and we have to work things out in syria with russia, and our presence on the ground matters. and the two to three thousand americans we have on the ground are not just any american soldiers. they are our most elite, most highly trained forces. again i visited them from the beginning of the campaign- i was one of the first civilians on the ground way back in the battle of kobanî. they have done an incredible job. it is those forces that allow the force of the syrian democratic forces with 60,000 syrians that we have helped build and enable, they allow that force to be effective. if you simply pull out american forces without a plan for what comes next, it is going to open up a signif- significant vacuum. i know the vice- vice president said we're gonna look for coalition partners to take our place. as the former leader of the coalition, i just don't think that that is credible. i know what it takes in these coalition capitals for them to put their blood and treasure on the line with us. it takes american leadership and takes american presence. and we've just told the world that we're no longer going to be present. so it'll have a dramatic ramification. and that's why, what i wrote in the washington post, i think we have to really accept some hard truths. i think number one we are leaving. the president has made that clear- we are leaving. and that means our force should be really with one mission: to get out and get out safely. we cannot add additional missions onto our force while they are trying to withdraw under pressure, because withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do.\n\nmargaret brennan: and i think what you're sketching out here is- to put it plainly- how we withdraw. accept that the president's mind- mind is made up. but one of the issues you have here is that the way the president is doing this puts forces at risk and puts the gains at risk. am i hearing you correctly?\n\nbrett mcgurk: announcing you're going to withdraw, and without a plan, and believe me there's no plan for what's coming next. right now we do not have a plan. it increases a vulnerability of our force. it increases the environment on the ground in syria. this environment in northeast syria has been fairly permissive and safe. again, i've been there almost 20 times and we have been- been very careful with this. it is increasing the risk to our people on the ground in syria and will open up space for isis. but what's most important is we cannot expect a partner such as turkey to come in and take our place, or another coalition partner to take our place. that is not realistic. and if our forces are under order to withdraw, as at the same time they are trying to find some formula for another coalition partner to come in, that is not workable. that is not a viable plan.\n\nmargaret brennan: so when the secretary of state says the u.s. military can strike isis or any threat in syria from anywhere, you're saying that's not actually the case? being on the ground matters.\n\nmcgurk: well having a presence on the ground is a critical force multiplier that has allowed us to defeat isis as

washington -- a joint-npr/wamu report published in late november exposed a culture of grade changing to boost graduation rates at a high school in washington, d.c. on tuesday, the findings of an audit essentially backed the reported claims, cbs affiliate wusa reports.\n\nalvarez and marsal, a law firm, found that 63.8 percent -- or 113 -- of 177 students who graduated from frank w. ballou senior high school last school year graduated with the assistance of policy violations, which were identified as actions such as awarding a student a 50 percent on assignments they did not finish or may have missed. in total, those students benefited from 222 violations, according to the law firm, wusa reports.\n\nballou administrators communicated high passing percentage expectations to teachers, reads the report, which says the school's principal and assistant principals were involved. these expectations were communicated directly to teachers from the principal to the assistant principals in person, via staff meetings, and via email, and were formalized in the ballou impact rubric.\n\nthe audit was ordered after the report published in november found that more than 50 percent of ballou's 2017 graduating class passed despite extensive absences.\n\nthe findings of the audit were discussed tuesday at a city hall news conference, where mayor muriel bowser told reporters, we rolled out a policy in the 2015-2016 school year intended to raise the bar in our school district (academically) and ensure students were set-up for success.\n\nbut we've never really put in place the training controls or accountability to support it, the mayor said.\n\nwe should've done a better job, bowser added.
if you've dropped and cracked your iphone and are looking to exchange it for a newer model, you will probably like the latest retail initiatives from apple. the company is reportedly launching a more generous iphone trade-in program at apple stores, as well as in-store installations of iphone screen protectors, the tech site 9to5mac reports.\n\nright now, the company's reuse and recycle iphone trade-in program gives customers the chance to trade in older phones for credit toward buying a newer iphone model. the catch? if these older phones have cracked displays or broken cameras or buttons, they aren't eligible to receive credit. with the new policy, credit will be given for iphone 5s, 6, and 6 plus phones that are damaged within reason. the main objective of this, of course, is to encourage phone upgrades rather than just getting a screen repair.\n\nsources told 9to5 mac that the current trade-in prices for this new program would be $50 for an iphone 5s, $200 for a 6, and $250 for a 6 plus.\n\nbeyond the trade-in program, apple stores will start installing plastic iphone screen protectors over the course of the next few weeks. right now, this is rolling out in a few select stores starting friday.\n\nwhy wasn't this offered in stores before? apple stores were instructed to avoid screen installations over concerns that putting third-party products on iphones might result in error. for this new program, if the machine install results in error, apple will give customers free protector replacements and try the installation again.
beijing — china's economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with washington.\n\ngrowth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017's 6.9 percent as both the world's appetite for china's exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed monday.\n\nforecasters said they expect beijing to try to shore up growth by making credit cheaper, raising government spending and adopting measures to encourage sales of autos and consumer goods.\n\ncommunist leaders want to steer china toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment. but the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting beijing to boost spending on construction of roads and bridges and to order banks to lend more, especially to the entrepreneurs who generate most of china's new jobs and wealth.\n\ndownward pressure on the economy is increasing, the commissioner of the national bureau of statistics, ning jizhe, said at a news conference. he cited import controls, volatile financial markets and declining investment spending as factors.\n\nstill, ning insisted china can resist shocks, saying the long-term trend of stability will not change.\n\nslowest growth since 1990\n\neconomic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990's 3.9 percent following the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on beijing's tiananmen square.\n\ngrowth in the last quarter of 2018 dipped to 6.4 percent — the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis — from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent.\n\nthe government is expected to implement more fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support economic growth, yanjun lin of ihs markit said in a report.\n\ngrowth in investment, retail spending and factory activity all declined, though analysts pointed to a flicker of improvement in manufacturing in december. it grew by 5.7 percent over a year earlier, up 0.3 percentage points from november.\n\nproduction of plastics, metals and specialized industrial machinery accelerated, suggesting warming expectations for a pick-up in investment, chaoping zhu of j.p. morgan asset management said in a report.\n\ntrade war taking a toll\n\nthe trade dispute with the u.s. is proving costly. exports held up through most of 2018 despite president donald trump's tariff hikes on chinese imports in a fight over beijing's technology ambitions. but they contracted in december as the penalties began to depress u.s. demand.\n\nthe two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 percent on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over u.s. complaints that beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. washington wants china to roll back plans for state-led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nthe trade dispute, and reports of job losses and tumbling sales of autos and real estate, have unnerved chinese consumers that beijing is counting on to drive growth. as pocketbooks snap shut, the downturn could worsen.\n\nchina's top trade envoy, vice premier liu he, is due to visit washington for talks jan. 30-31.\n\nbusiness groups and economists said a decision by liu and his american counterpart, robert lighthizer, to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower-level officials made progress.\n\ntrump said saturday that trade relations with china were going very well and a deal could very well happen.\n\nbeijing hits the gas\n\nforecasters expect chinese growth to bottom out this year as beijing's stimulus efforts gain traction. however, they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports.\n\npublic works spending is shaping up to be the engine for 2019, iris pang of ing said in a report. however, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. and debt will grow.\n\na meeting of communist party leaders in december promised tax cuts, better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector.\n\nchinese leaders have been warning that any recovery would be l-shaped, meaning that companies and investors shouldn't expect growth to rebound to the previous decade's double-digit levels.\n\nforecasters expect growth to decline further this year to 6.3 percent or lower.\n\nchina's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilizes in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus, julian evans-pritchard of capital economics said in a report.
new research finds tobacco products are being marketed and sold through unpaid content on facebook despite policies from the social media company restricting or prohibiting the promotion of these items. in many of these instances, there is no safeguard in place to prevent access to minors.\n\nfacebook has a portfolio of policies with the laudable intent of keeping tobacco promotion and sales out of the facebook platform, lead study author robert jackler, m.d., principal investigator of stanford research into the impact of tobacco advertising, told cbs news. these policies are voluntary, and they're a sign of facebook's commitment to social responsibility. unfortunately, these policies are inconsistently enforced and a large volume of tobacco promotion exists on facebook.\n\nfacebook bars paid tobacco advertisements, including ads for cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobaccos, tobacco pipes, hookahs, hookah lounges, rolling papers, vaporized delivery devices and electronic cigarettes. according to its advertising policy, images of tobacco and related products, as well as links to sites where such items can be purchased, are not permitted.\n\nthe social media giant does allow blogs or groups connecting people with tobacco-related interests, as long as they're not selling tobacco or tobacco-related products. but it has an array of rules in place that apply to sales and commercial activity.\n\nfacebook\n\nhowever, new research from the stanford university school of medicine finds many tobacco companies are getting around these restrictions through unpaid or organic posts, mainly on their brand-sponsored facebook pages.\n\nout of 108 company-sponsored facebook pages for leading brands of cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco and smokeless tobacco, the study authors found more than half included purchase links, such as a shop now-type button. roughly two-thirds of the pages offered sales promotions, including coupons and discounts. all but one featured images of tobacco products.\n\nwhile none of the 21 top traditional cigarette brands had facebook pages, the study found 10 of 14 online tobacco stores with company-maintained pages promoted popular cigarette brands, such as marlboro, camel, newport, and american spirit, and included links to purchase them. the results of the study are published online in the bmj tobacco control.\n\nfacebook has what it calls an age-gate requirement for the private sale of regulated goods, including tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. this means anyone under the age of 18 should not be able to access pages promoting the private sale of these items. facebook notes that the age restriction applies only to private individuals selling items peer-to-peer, not licensed retailers.\n\nthe researchers found only 48 out of the 108 tobacco brand-sponsored facebook pages had a safeguard in place to restrict access to minors.\n\nthis is important, jackler says, because younger people are more likely to begin using tobacco, with the risk of becoming addicted to nicotine.\n\nas the vast majority of smoking initiation occurs during teen years, the tobacco industry has a long history of targeting adolescents, he said. if you want to reach teens in 2018, the place to do it is via social media, especially facebook, because such a high fraction of youth use it on a daily basis. \n\nrecent figures show 5.8 million u.s. teens aged 13-17 use facebook, and 65 percent of them say they check it every day. the social network has over 2 billion users worldwide.\n\nthe researchers also analyzed the number of likes for each company-sponsored facebook page. at the time of the study, 30 of the pages had accumulated 10,000 or more likes, with four of the pages having more than 50,000 likes.\n\njackler said he and his team were not surprised that tobacco companies found ways around facebook's restrictions to promote the sale of their products.\n\nwhat did surprise us was the volume and variety of unpaid tobacco promotion we encountered on facebook and the passivity of facebook in sustaining its own policies, he said. while facebook was vigilant in excluding paid tobacco advertisements, which appear to receive special scrutiny, it seems to have no systematic monitoring of tobacco brand sponsored promotion on its pages.\n\nfacebook took issue with some aspects of the study, for example noting that its commerce policies only apply to the shop section of a company's page, while the researchers considered a broader array of posts.\n\nin a statement provided to cbs news, facebook said:\n\nselling or advertising tobacco products is not allowed on facebook. we use a combination of technology, human review and reports from our community to find and remove any content that violates these policies, and provide tools that make it easy for our community to report content they think may violate. our enforcement is not perfect, but we continue to find ways to strengthen our review and enforcement of our policies.\n\nhowever, jackler says the issue is not principally with facebook, but with the tobacco companies.\n\nit is primarily focused upon exposing yet another example of the cynical way the tobacco industry circumvents any and all attempts to constrain its never ceasing efforts to promote its products, jackler said.\n\nhe said ultimately, the study exposes loopholes within facebook that the social network has the opportunity to close.\n\nour hope is that our study, by highlighting the degree to which tobacco marketers evade their intended restrictions, will encourage facebook to make a renewed effort to implement their well-intentioned policies, jackler said.
columbia, mo. - missouri quarterback maty mauk has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nathletic director mack rhodes and coach barry odom announced the punishment on monday night after a brief video was posted to twitter. it shows a person appearing to snort a white, powder-like substance and the accompanying tweet mentions mauk by name, but there was no confirmation from missouri that the video shows the quarterback.\n\nrhodes and odom say in their joint statement they are gathering information regarding the video in question. they say they will take appropriate action once they have all the facts.\n\nit is mauk's third suspension in the last four months. he was suspended in september for an undisclosed violation of team policy and again in november for unspecified disciplinary reasons.
dallas - soon delta air lines will require additional documentation for passengers taking service animals with them on flights. this comes amid an increase of incidents involving animals, including a dog attack last year.\n\nstarting march 1, customers will have to show proof of health or vaccinations for their animals 48 hours in advance. in addition, owners of emotional-support animals will need to sign a statement confirming their animal can behave. however, the new requirements don't apply to pets that stay in kennels during flights.\n\ndelta's new rules are aimed at two different types of animals. the first are service animals, which receive specific training to help blind or disabled passengers. then there are emotional-support animals, which require no training at all. both fly for free and are not required to be caged during the flight.\n\nfederal regulators have interpreted a 1986 access-to-travel law to allow support animals in airplane cabins and in apartment buildings that do not allow pets. but some people use untrained pets in order to get them on a plane for free, especially since it's easy to go online to buy vests or id card with a service animal insignia.\n\ndelta said the idea behind the new regulations is to keep trained service animals and emotional-support animals safe from aggressive ones. overall, the airline says it carries 700 service or support animals every day. but people have tried to fly with everything from turkeys, to snakes, spiders and even gliding possums, which are also known as sugar gliders.\n\nsince 2016, the company reported an 86-percent increase in 'animal incidents', that include animals urinating, biting or showing acts of aggression. last june, a 70-pound dog flying as a support animal bit another passenger several times in the face on a delta plane in atlanta. the victim was hospitalized.\n\naccording to cbs news correspondent don dahler, tom panek, ceo of guiding eyes for the blind, was on a delta flight recently, made miserable by a misbehaving support dog.\n\nfor two and a half hours, passengers had to tolerate this dog while it was barking, lunging and disrupting the flight, panek said. no one wanted to confront this individual and say that that dog is not appropriate as an emotional support dog.\n\nit might seem like a harmless way to travel with your pet, but panek says there are serious repercussions.\n\nit profoundly affects us because the next time that we go into a restaurant, they may tell me, 'no, you don't have access here', and i wouldn't be able to take three steps without gus.\n\nnineteen states have laws against calling untrained dogs, service dogs. arizona is considering legislation to become the twentieth.
the economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in many respects, but all too familiar in one: the crisis has taken a particular toll on young workers.\n\nas unemployment around the u.s. was peaking this spring, more than a quarter of young americans lost their jobs. most of the country's youngest workers have either lost a job or taken a pay cut during the crash, according to pew research — and perhaps not surprisingly, they are also the most likely to report having trouble paying their bills or rent.\n\nyounger people who still have jobs are least likely to have the option of telecommuting, according to a report from the economic policy institute (epi), losing out on a large added measure of protection from the virus, not to mention the cost savings of not having to commute. they're also most likely to have relocated due to the pandemic: for the first time since the 1930s, more young adults in the u.s. are living with parents than not, according to pew data.\n\nnot only have many young people in this country faced the harsh reality of returning to school without in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, the job prospects for those seeking employment have been particularly bleak, economists at the left-leaning epi said in a recent report.\n\nyoung workers were among those hit hardest by the coronavirus shutdown this spring. the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds peaked at 27% in april, according the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. as of november, unemployment among the youngest workers was twice as high as among other employees.\n\nfirst jobs vaporized\n\nthe pandemic has shuttered many of the service industries that have historically employed young people: restaurants, bars, coffee shops and retail stores.\n\nlast year, one in four young workers had a job in the leisure and hospitality sector — an industry that lost 3.3 million jobs in 2020, the bureau of labor statistics reports. another one-fifth of young workers were in the retail sector, which is down 680,000 jobs since the spring.\n\nthis crisis has delayed that very first step into the labor force, said annelizabeth konkel, economist at the indeed hiring lab. it's that first experience of making money — it may have been an office internship, or a cashier in a book store, or restaurant job over summer.\n\ncole stevens, who graduated from high school this spring, has been working since he was 14 to help with his family's expenses. in april, the minneapolis-area coffee shop where stevens worked part-time closed, putting him and other high school students out of work.\n\nit was all high school students that work there. and we lost that business, all of those students were out of a job, stevens said at a recent roundtable discussion with minnesota governor tim walz. after a legal battle, he was able to collect unemployment benefits.\n\n\n\nmy family never had a lot of money, so i learned the value of family and the value of the dollar when i was young, stevens told cbs minnesota. he has long wanted to start his own business, but working to support himself has delayed those plans, stevens told walz at the roundtable event.\n\nfailure to launch\n\ndelayed entry into the workforce is becoming far more common for american teenagers, whose rates of working have plummeted since the 1990s, according to data from the census bureau, the labor department and the federal reserve. however, the unprecedented breadth of the pandemic, which has permanently closed more than 100,000 restaurants and thousands more small businesses, raises questions about how much work there will be once the virus abates.\n\nmeanwhile, those young people lucky enough to find a first job in these times can look forward to a lifetime of lower earnings, thanks to having entered the job market during a recession. decades of research show that college graduates who start work during recessions earn, on average, less than their peers from other generations for up to 20 years, and in some cases for their entire working lives.\n\n\n\nbecause of their initial bad start, they often get stuck in low-paying, low-quality jobs. even when the economy gets stronger, it can be difficult for these workers to catch up to their pre-recession cohorts, epi said.\n\ndouble whammy for millennials\n\nindeed, research on millennials, the generation that entered the job market during the great recession and whose oldest members will turn 40 this year, shows that the dismal economy had weighed on their ability to earn and keep money.\n\nthey've really gotten hit twice — the great recession and now, again, a crisis. that's going to impact lifetime earnings, said konkel.\n\ni feel like i've regressed to my teenage years: i'm in my childhood home, in my childhood bedroom. i have chores again, 30-year-old eric rivera told cbs this morning. he moved from his apartment in brooklyn, new york, to his parents' home in new jersey after losing his job during the pandemic.\n\nyou kind of start spiraling: am i ever going to move out of this house? rivera said. i'm still hopeful about finding a job and moving out on my own again, but that timeline's a moving target.\n\n\n\nmillennials, as a group, are earning less than their parents. they have far less wealth and more debt than baby boomers did at the same age. today, just 5% of national wealth is held by the millennial generation. boomers, at the same age, held more than double that.\n\nin personal finance lore, the 30s are a time to build up a savings cushion, pay into your retirement fund and perhaps buy a home. but, konkel said, millennials already didn't have a good cushion to start with, because of the great recession.\n\nthe current crisis will further exacerbate those decisions: when to get married, whether to have kids, how many kids to have, because kids are expensive, konkel said. indeed, brookings researchers have warned america to expect a baby bust next year, with 300,000 fewer births happening than would normally be expected.\n\nmeanwhile, many millennials who are parents are finding their work and family in conflict — and are being pushed away from work. one in five working parents isn't working in order to take care of their children, the census bureau found this summer.\n\nthat burden largely falls on women, two million of whom have dropped out of the workforce this year, a reality reflected in the labor participation rates for men and women of parenting age. after losing jobs earlier this year, men are rejoining the labor force — but women aren't.\n\nwe're just seeing so many women leaving the labor force, and there are concerns about will they come back? said konkel. have we lost the last 20 years of progress?\n\nshe added, if they don't come back, we are not going to return to where we were in the pre-covid era. we're not going to get back a full, robust recovery.
updated at 3:17 p.m. et\n\nsenate and house leaders announced friday they are postponing work on two controversial anti-piracy bills in the wake of large online protests that spurred several congressmen to rethink the legislation.\n\nsenate majority leader harry reid announced today that he is postponing tuesday's procedural vote on the protect ip act (pipa). meanwhile, house judiciary committee chairman lamar smith said his committee is postponing consideration of pipa's house companion, the stop online piracy act (sopa), until there is wider agreement on a solution.\n\npipa and sopa are intended to strengthen protections against copyright infringement and intellectual property theft, but internet advocates say they would stifle expression on the world wide web. cbs corporation is among the media and entertainment companies that support the legislation.\n\nin protest of the legislation, major sites like wikipedia and reddit participated in a 24-hour internet blackout on wednesday, while other sites like google took less drastic steps to signify their opposition to the legislation. the protests inspired voters to deluge their congressmen with phone calls and emails in protest of the bills as well, and by wednesday afternoon, several congressmen either came out in opposition to the bills or said congress should take more time to reconsider them. it seemed unlikely pipa would find the 60 votes necessary to pass tuesday's test vote in the senate.\n\nadam green, co-founder of the grassroots group progressive change campaign committee, said the legislation's delay shows that people power works. his organization helped about 43,000 people call their congressmen in opposition to the bill.\n\nsopa, pipa: what you need to know\n\nsopa, pipa protests spur congress to rethink bills\n\nsopa and pipa internet blackout aftermath, staggering numbers\n\nreid said in a statement, there is no reason that the legitimate issues raised by many about this bill cannot be resolved. he encouraged pipa's author, sen. patrick leahy, d-vt., to continue working with stakeholders on the bill to forge a balance between protecting americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the internet.\n\nreid said the senate had made good progress through its discussions on the bill in recent weeks and that he's optimistic that the senate can reach a compromise. he stressed that counterfeiting and piracy are serious problems that hurt major industries, including the movie industry, which supports 2.2 million jobs alone.\n\nwe must take action to stop these illegal practices, he said. we live in a country where people rightfully expect to be fairly compensated for a day's work, whether that person is a miner in the high desert of nevada, an independent band in new york city, or a union worker on the back lots of a california movie studio.\n\nthe house judiciary committee was slated to take up sopa again in february, but smith issued a statement after reid's pipa announcement, noting that he also has heard from critics of the bills.\n\ni take seriously their concerns regarding proposed legislation to address the problem of online piracy, he said. it is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell american inventions and products.\n\nsmith said the problem of online piracy is too big to ignore and that the house judiciary committee will continue to work with both copyright owners and internet companies to find the right solution.\n\nin his own statement, leahy criticized the senators who walked back their support for pipa, compelling reid to postpone the procedural vote, which would have officially started a senate floor debate on the bill.\n\nthe day will come when the senators who forced this move will look back and realize they made a knee-jerk reaction to a monumental problem, leay said. somewhere in china today, in russia today, and in many other countries that do not respect american intellectual property, criminals who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen american content are smugly watching how the united states senate decided it was not even worth debating how to stop the overseas criminals from draining our economy.\n\nopponents of sopa and pipa object to the bill in part because they argue it would impose a huge, unmanageable burden on internet companies to police their sites for connections to copyright or intellectual property infringers. start ups in particular would not be able to handle the legal costs involved, and it could quash innovation in the internet industry.\n\nsenate republican leader mitch mcconnell said friday he was encouraged by reid's decision to postpone the vote.\n\nwe all agree that we must do more to combat the on-line theft of intellectual property, mcconnell said in a statement, but he said pipa raised serious legal, policy and operational concerns.\n\nrepublican rep. darrell issa of california and democratic sen. ron wyden of oregon co-authored a bill intended to serve as an alternative to sopa and pipa -- the online protection and enforcement of digital trade (open) act.\n\nfor all those who might have thought that their voice didn't count in their government, i hope you now know it does, wyden tweeted after reid postponed the pipa vote.\n\nissa said in a statement that postponing the pipa vote removes the imminent threat to the internet, but it's not over yet. copyright infringement remains a serious problem and any solution must be targeted, effective, and consistent with how the internet works.\n\ncomputer & communications industry association president ed black said in a statement that those who value and appreciate the internet can breathe a little easier today.\n\nwe recognize that the dynamic quality of the internet can be disruptive to established entities and practices, whether they be governments, companies, or individuals, black said. when legitimate interests and problems result, we remain prepared to address those problems in ways that don't damage the core principles on which the internet depends.
on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan:\n\nformer secretary of state john kerry @johnkerry\n\n@johnkerry secretary of defense mark esper @esperdod\n\n@esperdod senator tim kaine, d-virgina, @timkaine\n\nd-virgina, @timkaine senator mike lee, r-utah, @senmikelee\n\nr-utah, @senmikelee representative adam schiff, d-california @repadamschiff\n\nclick here to browse full transcripts of face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: i'm margaret brennan in washington. and this week on face the nation, the critical standoff between the u.s. and iran deescalates, but the conflict takes a tragic turn and now there's a new crisis, as iran admits to erroneously shooting down a passenger aircraft killing a hundred and seventy-six. we'll have the latest.\n\nand here in the u.s. some in congress are demanding answers as to why the administration continues to send mixed messages about the, quote, imminent threat used to justify the strike in the first place.\n\non saturday, the iranian government acknowledged what they've been denying for days, that following retaliatory missile strikes on u.s. installations in iraq--they'd unintentionally shot down ukrainian passenger jet mistaking it for an incoming missile. a high-ranking iranian official was quick to point to u.s. provocation as partially to blame. now iranians are angry with their own government and the u.s.\n\nas washington and baghdad remain at an impasse over the role of u.s. forces in iraq, we'll talk to secretary of defense mark esper.\n\npresident donald trump: we did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll also ask him about the intelligence behind the killing of soleimani. the administration's handling of the crisis is causing frustration even among some republicans loyal to the president.\n\nmike lee: now, i find this insulting and demeaning.\n\nmargaret brennan: republican mike lee, democrats tim kaine and adam schiff will all be here. plus, former secretary of state john kerry weighs in on iran and why he's supporting joe biden.\n\nand a special behind-the-scenes report from our liz palmer, she and her team spent a tumultuous week in iran.\n\nall that and more, is just ahead on face the nation.\n\ngood morning and welcome to face the nation. we begin this morning with the secretary of defense, mark esper. good morning to you, mister secretary. good to have you here.\n\nmark esper (secretary of defense/@esperdod): good morning, margaret. thank you for having me.\n\nmargaret brennan: our team in tehran witnessed anti-government protests, chants against the regime. what is the u.s. assessment of what's happening on the ground?\n\nmark esper: we are safer today than we were just a few weeks ago. why? because we took out the world's foremost terrorist leader, qasem soleimani, who had the blood of hundreds of american dead service members on his hands. secondly, we restored deterrence with iran without any united states casualties. and, third, we reassured our partners-- partners and allies in the region that we will stand up and defend our interests. i think when you look at--\n\nmargaret brennan: in terms of restoring deterrence, there wasn't an-- iran fired off missiles at the united states' bases, so.\n\nmark esper: we-- we are confident we restored deterrence. and if you look to your question--\n\nmargaret brennan: you don't expect any further attacks on u.s. presence?\n\nmark esper: we do not expect any further attacks. but if you look at what's happening on the ground today, you have just yesterday in tehran and other cities, iranians chanting, death to the ayatollah. we don't-- we don't think america is our enemy. you can see the-- the iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights, their aspirations for a better government, a different-- a different regime.\n\nmargaret brennan: so what is the assessment, though, of-- of what level of threat there is to the regime's hold on power? because the president was tweeting yesterday in farsi messages that he stands with the protesters and he's following closely what's happening.\n\nmark esper: well, we do stand with the iranian people. they want the same things that most people around the world want. they want prosperity. they want the ability to-- to live their lives, to raise their children. and we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. i just think you see a very corrupt regime that the iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.\n\nmargaret brennan: so is there still an offer to negotiate with that regime you call corrupt? because by saying you stand with the protesters, it seems to be in contradiction to an offer to negotiate with the government they're protesting against.\n\nmark esper: well, it is still the legitimate government, if you will, of iran. and what we've said, i've said publicly, the president certainly has said, is we will meet with them. we're willing to sit down and discuss without precondition, a new way forward, a-- a-- a series of steps by which iran becomes a more normal country.\n\nmargaret brennan: that's-- offer still stands?\n\nmark esper: that offer still stands.\n\nmargaret brennan: and if something happens to these protesters in the street, i mean is there a line that the president won't meet with iran?\n\nmark esper: the president has drawn no preconditions other than to say we're willing to meet with the iranian government.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. i want to ask you about the downing of this ukrainian commercial airliner. the iranian foreign minister tweeted, admitted it was a mistake on their behalf, but also said, essentially, the u.s. contributed because of the escalation. what's your response to that?\n\nmark esper: well, first of all, it's a terrible tragedy. a hundred and seventy-six people from many nations killed. it's a shame that the first reaction of the iranian government to show their corruption, wanted to say that it was american propaganda, when, clearly, it was just a horrible mistake. to somehow allow iran to play the victim card with the international community is just ridiculous. these tensions started many years ago, twenty years ago, forty years ago, and escalated in the past twelve months, led by the terrorist leader, qasem soleimani, who is escalating attacks against united states forces in the region, in baghdad in particular, which ultimately led to the siege of the united states embassy there.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you about that attempt to breach the perimeter and the embassy. but also, broadly, the threat that the u.s. was tracking that has been described as imminent time and again by the administration. the president said last week that there was an attempt to blow up the u.s. embassy in baghdad. here's, specifically, what he said on fox news.\n\npresident donald trump (fox news/friday): i can reveal that i believe it would have been four embassies, but baghdad certainly would have been the lead. but i think it would have been four embassy; could have been military bases; could have been a lot of other things, too. but it was imminent. and then all of a sudden he was gone.\n\nmargaret brennan: why couldn't you share that specific threat with senators in a classified briefing?\n\nmark esper: well, that information-- there was a reference in this-- in this exquisite intelligence to an attack on the united states embassy in baghdad. that information was shared with the gang of eight. all that exceptional intelligence shared with the gang of eight, not the broader membership of the congress.\n\nmargaret brennan: a specific threat against the u.s. embassy in baghdad to blow it up--\n\nmark esper: well, i was--\n\nmargaret brennan: --was shared with the gang of eight?\n\nmark esper: i was not in that meeting with the gang of eight. but i will tell you, i spoke to one of the briefers. what the briefer said to me coming out of that meeting was his assessment that most, if not all the members, thought that the intelligence was persuasive and that they-- and that the gang of eight did not think that it should be released to the broader members of congress.\n\nmargaret brennan: but, broadly, can you clarify though, was the specific threat that the president shared with fox news about four u.s. embassies being under threat, also shared with congress? why was there a difference?\n\nmark esper: well, what the president said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. i shared that view. i know other members of national security team shared that view. that's why i deployed thousands of american paratroopers to the middle east to reinforce our embassy in baghdad and other sites throughout the region.\n\nmargaret brennan: probably, and could have been.\n\nmark esper: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: that is-- that sounds more like an assessment than a specific, tangible threat with a-- a decisive piece of intelligence.\n\nmark esper: well, the president didn't say there was a tangible-- he didn't cite a specific piece of evidence. what he says probably-- he believed, could have been--\n\nmargaret brennan: are you saying there wasn't one?\n\nmark esper: i didn't see one with regard to four embassies. what i'm saying is i share the president's view that probably-- my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies. the embassies are the most prominent display of american presence in a country.\n\nmargaret brennan: the description had been that this was a imminent threat to u.s. personnel and facilities in the region.\n\nmark esper: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: is that a more accurate description than what the president provided?\n\nmark esper: well, what i've said publicly, i've-- i've said many times, is that we had information that there was going to be attack within a matter of days that would be broad in scale, in other words, more than one country, and that it would be bigger than previous attacks, likely going to take us into open hostilities with iran.\n\nmargaret brennan: is that threat gone?\n\nmark esper: that was orchestrated by qasem-- qasem soleimani. he was the one-- was-- has led the attacks against america for twenty years now.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmark esper: so we had every expectation to believe that this would happen. in fact, a very, very senior person from the intelligence community said the risk of inaction is greater than the risk of action. that was compelling for me.\n\nmargaret brennan: is that threat gone?\n\nmark esper: that threat has been disrupted. i think what we have to find out now is continue to work to make sure that that threat is completely eliminated.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you understand the frustration and anger from members of congress who say why the president-- why can the president tell fox news something he can't tell members of congress or-- or members of his administration can't explicitly explain to members of congress?\n\nmark esper: well, look, i understand the frustration. the fact is that evidence, that information is only available to the gang of eight. that's been practice and policy for decades.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you said you don't know that it was told to the gang of eight.\n\nmark esper: well, i'm talking about, the intelligence stream, the exquisite intelligence. that was told-- that information of that source and method was revealed to the gang of eight. i understand the frustration of the broader members of congress. they are not going to have access to that information. i would support it if we-- if we didn't jeopardize the sources and methods. and i think the president said the same.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator mike lee, who will be with us on this program--\n\nmark esper: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: --also was frustrated with your briefing. and he said, you know, why did you tell members of congress that it would, essentially, be a negative message to try to call into question that the authorization for military force in iraq.\n\nmark esper: well, no--\n\nmargaret brennan: why did you oppose that debate?\n\nmark esper: well, first of all, for every member that didn't like the brief, there's members that thought it was the greatest brief ever. that was never said that they should not have a debate, that they should have a discussion. i was asked a specific question about do i have concerns about a debate? and what all i said was this: is as that debate continues--don't-- not have a debate--but as that debate ensues, be conscious of the messaging, particularly to our troops, because they are looking for messages. do they have the support of the american people while they are in harm's way? why do i say that? my predecessors-- predecessors have said that in the past. and i had the personal experience in the 1991 gulf war. i was on the ground preparing for our final actions to go into iraq.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmark esper: and we watched very carefully the debate in congress in mid-january of that year to find out did we have the support of the--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmark esper: --american people and our lawmakers.\n\nmargaret brennan: quickly, are other iranian leaders still potential targets? because we have reported that there was an irgc leader in yemen targeted the very same day qasem soleimani was killed.\n\nmark esper: look, i'm not going to speak to any planned or alleged operations. we will exercise everything we need to do to protect the american people, to protect our forces, to protect our embassies.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you're not denying that report?\n\nmark esper: i'm not going to speak to any-- any reports.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. i want to quickly ask you as well about the presence in iraq. will the u.s. cut off u.s. aid if the iraqi government tries to expel u.s. troops?\n\nmark esper: well, let's take this one step at a time. we're not there yet. what we need to do is sit down, have discussions with iraq. we're doing that now. i want to-- we also intend to do that with our nato partners. i had a good conversation the other day with the nato secretary general, jens stoltenberg. we're going to send a team over to discuss how can nato play a bigger role in the iraq mission? two important missions there. one is to train, advise, and assist the iraqi military. and number two is the enduring defeat of isis. we are committed to both those operations. and i think that we can work out a better way forward.\n\nmargaret brennan: does plussing up a nato presence mean drawing down the five thousand u.s. troops?\n\nmark esper: well, it could. it's been my aspiration for some time to have a smaller footprint in iraq and--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you have a number in mind?\n\nmark esper: --in the broader middle east. no, i think that's-- that's a matter for commanders on the ground to assess. we have to look at whether the capabilities that our nato partners can bring to the-- bring to the-- bring to the fore. and i think that has to be a process in full respect of-- of-- of iraq's sovereignty. at the end of the day, the united states government wants what the iraqi people want, and that is a strong, prosperous, and independent iraq.\n\nmargaret brennan: on saudi arabia, we are reporting-- cbs news is reporting that about a dozen or so saudi service people may be expelled from the united states in the wake of that pensacola shooting and an investigation. is that the right number? what-- can you tell us about that? and what did the president mean when he said saudi arabia deposited a billion dollars into a bank account in exchange for u.s. troop deployment?\n\nsec. esper: well, two separate things. you know, first of all, the-- what you're referring to is an investigation being conducted by the doj and the fbi in the wake of that-- that tragic shooting in pensacola some-- few weeks ago. in the wake of that, the department has taken a number of steps to-- to ensure it doesn't happen again. i've signed out directives that address enhanced screening of all of our foreign students that address credentialing going forward, weapons policies, etc. so we're doing everything we can. the investigation is being conducted by doj and fbi. i'm sure they will release something on that in the coming days.\n\nmargaret brennan: and the billion dollars into the u.s. bank account?\n\nmark esper: well, what the president is referring to is burden sharing. burden sharing comes in many forms. when we talk to nato, we talk about contributing more to their gdp to defense commitment. and the president's actions have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars more being contributed by our nato allies. it includes--\n\nmargaret brennan: but that's not a transaction like what he described.\n\nmark esper: well, it includes host nation support, it includes foreign military cells, it includes providing troops on the ground, and in cases it provides helping to offset some of our operations maintenance costs, which the saudis are committed to doing, just as they did offset costs during the 1990 and '91 gulf war.\n\nmargaret brennan: secretary--\n\nmark esper: burden sharing.\n\nmargaret brennan: --appreciate your time.\n\nmark esper: thank you, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we'll be back in a moment with the house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff. stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're joined now by the chairman of the house intelligence committee, adam schiff. good morning to you, mister chairman.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff (d-california/intelligence committee chairman/@repadamschiff): good morning.\n\nmargaret brennan: you are part of the gang of eight, so you're part of that group that received the very classified briefing that the defense secretary was referring to. he said the intelligence was exquisite, and it was incredibly detailed. do you quibble with his characterization of what you were told?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: i don't quibble with it. i think it's just plain wrong. there was no discussion in the gang of eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these are the specific targets.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about u.s. embassy, baghdad?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: it-- it--\n\nmargaret brennan: he said that was specifically referenced.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, i don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the u.s. embassy in baghdad. the brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that secretary pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. that was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. in the view of the briefers, there was plotting. there was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. and so when you hear the president out there on fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. when secretary pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. that's not an intelligence conclusion. that is pompeo's personal opinion. intelligence--\n\nmargaret brennan: is that a polite way of saying they're lying?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, you know, you could certainly put it that way. but, frankly, i think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. and when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with iran, that's a dangerous thing to do.\n\nmargaret brennan: but to be fair, because you are the intel committee chairman, you know, the intel committee often or-- that the intelligence committee works in assessments, in judgments, in putting together mosaics, pieces of information to come to a conclusion. when esper is working in beliefs and projections, isn't that just how it works? impossibilities and not necessarily always having one conclusive piece of the exact place and time?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, that's exactly right. but that-- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. if we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking soleimani out make us safer or less safe? they would say to us, congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policymakers need to make. what we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that soleimani was plotting, as far as i can tell. and so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: --the burden of imminence, of showing imminence with very great specifics, i think is very high.\n\nmargaret brennan: so i-- i just want to button up because the defense secretary also said that in that gang of eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though, he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the gang of eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of congress. he said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well--\n\nmargaret brennan: is this is a political decision?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: he said a couple of things. he said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. that's not correct. i can tell you i wasn't, and there were other members of the gang of eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. in terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. and so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. it wasn't because i don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.\n\nmargaret brennan: have you heard from members of the intelligence community that they objected to what the administration did?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: they are not going to volunteer that. in other words, the intelligence community doesn't want to get crosswise with the white house and with--\n\nmargaret brennan: you've spoken to cia director gina haspel?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: this was, it appears, according to esper's description, also her assessment.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, i don't know whether esper has represented that the cia director supported or didn't support a strike on soleimani. the job of the cia director is to say, this is what our intelligence shows, this is what our intelligence analysts tell us will be the repercussions if you take soleimani out. that is the principal role. it's the president's call whether that justifies taking a strike, but that should be done in consultation with congress and approved by congress. and neither of those things happened here.\n\nmargaret brennan: should other irgc leaders be targeted?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: i think that we have escalated enough, and--\n\nmargaret brennan: even though iran says it's standing down and the president has used that phrase?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, i think what we're likely to see, at least in the near term, is the end of iran's overt attacks, like the missile attack on our bases. i don't think that we conclude-- conclude at all that we've seen an end to the-- their use of shia and other proxies. and so the risk to american troops and to american civilians continues, i think is-- is greater now as a result of the administration's actions. iran has been humiliated by-- by this taking out of their top leadership, but also by their disastrous shoot down of this civilian aircraft.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: that makes them, i think, more dangerous and provocative in the sense that we may very well see covert retaliation against the united states.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key-- a key-- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. i'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a senate trial?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: well, that'll be the speaker's decision. i don't want to get ahead of her--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you want to be?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: --thinking. i've told the speaker that i will play whatever role that she and the caucus believe would be useful.\n\nmargaret brennan: and the speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing john bolton, the former national security adviser to the president. is that something you would be looking at? are you looking at?\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: you know it's certainly something that we are considering. but, look, americans want to see a fair trial in the senate. they want to see a trial that's fair to the president and they want to see a trial that's fair to the american people, that brings all the facts forward. there-- there's little sense in bringing bolton in to the house and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. if they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. he has offered to come forward and testify. there is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the president's wrongdoing. if mcconnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: --it will be the first impeachment trial in history where the subject of the trial didn't resign, mid trial where they didn't have witnesses. that's not a fair trial. that's a sham. that's a cover up. and i think one of the things that holding on to the articles has succeeded doing is--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nrepresentative adam schiff: --fleshing out mcconnell and the president's desire to make this a cover up.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, we will get to what that trial might look like with mike lee, senator from utah, a republican ally of the president, who will be with us soon.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're back with utah republican senator mike lee. he's written a number of books about the constitution and our country's founding documents. he joins us this morning from salt lake city. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator mike lee (r-utah/@senmikelee): good morning.\n\nmargaret brennan: you heard the secretary of defense say that there was a specific threat assessment shared with the gang of eight. should that threat stream have been shared with the rest of congress, people like yourself?\n\nsenator mike lee: yes, it should have. it's important to remember that the gang of eight does not equal congress. the house of representatives has four hundred and thirty-five members. the senate has one hundred members. look, i understand secretary esper's point. i understand that not every piece of information can or pragmatically should be shared with all five hundred and thirty-five members of congress, but drive by notification to eight people is not the same as notification to congress. remember, there is an important constitutional reason for this. we have some overlap between-- and some natural tension between the article 2 commander-in-chief power--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator mike lee: --enjoyed by the president and the article 1 section 8 war power that is possessed by congress. in order to know and understand where one power ends and another begins in any context, we need to have a certain amount of information--\n\nmargaret brennan: you--\n\nsenator mike lee: --and an adequate amount of information was not shared with us.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, there was information shared with fox news in that interview the president gave where he said it was his belief that there were four embassies that were going to be threatened by attack by iran. you've spoken to the president. was that television interview the first time you heard it?\n\nsenator mike lee: yes, it was. let me say about the president. i have great respect for president trump for how he's handled this situation and how he's handled other situations involving his immense power as commander-in-chief. i believe more than any other president in my lifetime, president trump has shown restraint in the way he's exercised that power. there-- any other president--\n\nmargaret brennan: but do you have a problem with learning it on television?\n\nsenator mike lee: --would've taken us to war several times. yes, but the problem there is not with the president. the problem is with those who are briefing us.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\nsenator mike lee: those who are briefing us, i believe would have done a different job under the light of day had television cameras been there than they did in private--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator mike lee: --where his boss couldn't see what they were saying, that they were not helpful and they didn't reflect well on the president's great restraint that he's shown and deference to the american people.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator, i want to continue this conversation, specifically, about war powers as well on the other side of this commercial break. so stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with senator mike lee and then democratic senator tim kaine and former secretary of state john kerry. plus, a report from elizabeth palmer, our cbs news team in iran. stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we're back now with more from republican senator mike lee. senator, you heard the defense secretary say there was not one definitive, specific piece of intelligence that indicated these four embassy attacks were being planned. it was a belief. does that give you pause?\n\nsenator mike lee: no, not necessarily. look, i want to be clear, within hours after general soleimani was killed, i made a public statement to the effect that the fact that he is dead is a good thing. it's a positive signal for the safety and security of the american people. and i stand by that. this is a guy who would've done a lot of damage.\n\nmargaret brennan: i'm not sure if the senator can still hear me. i think we just had an interruption on that feed. so, hopefully, we'll pick it up. standing by, though, in richmond, going live now to virginia's senator, tim kaine. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator tim kaine (d-virginia/@timkaine): good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: and you and senator lee have actually found some common cause here, despite the difference in your parties, on a frustration regarding the president's lack of consultation with congress. and i want to dive into that. but let's--\n\nsenator tim kaine: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: -- start off specifically on-- on what we learned. because you are on the senate foreign relations committee, which has oversight of the state department and, therefore, embassies, were you aware that there was any kind of threat, specifically, to embassy baghdad and three other posts, as the president has described?\n\nsenator tim kaine: no, i wasn't, margaret. i-- i was at the classified briefing because i'm both a-- an armed services and foreign relations member. that was not told to us in the classified briefing, nor was there a suggestion that multiple embassies were threatened. and i think that was one of the reasons that the senators in the briefing were so unhappy. we felt that the evidence was far short of imminent threat. we were mad that they were so dismissive of the notion that congress would have anything to do with questions of war and peace. and we also thought that the administration was very cavalier about the iraqi reaction-- the iraqi resolution of parliament that the u.s. should leave. they were sort of like, oh, that's just the way the iraqis talk.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator tim kaine: this is a very serious concern. and the administration was downplaying it in a way that i think was very unrealistic.\n\nmargaret brennan: but, specifically, the defense secretary said the gang of eight was told in specific detail and they chose not to share it with members of congress. you are saying that you were never told of a threat to the u.s. embassy?\n\nsenator tim kaine: no, no, and, as i've talked to the gang of eight, again, this is classified information, i'm not going to put that all on the table. but members of the gang of eight on the senate side, were not happy with the degree of him-- this-- this question of was there an imminent threat? the administration says there was exquisite and detailed intelligence. that means it was specific. but for it to be-- justify the president taking, essentially, an act of war on iraqi soil to wipe out a-- an iranian military leader, it had to not just be a plan, but an imminent threat. and that usually means it's more than a plan. there's been some move toward making a decision to execute on the plan. and we heard nothing about that in the briefing or in any of the conversations i've had with administration leaders.\n\nmargaret brennan: why is it not sufficient enough for the administration to say broadly there was a threat to u.s. personnel in the region, as esper said, within days? why don't you trust that?\n\nsenator tim kaine: well, look, the bottom line is the constitution makes really plain it's-- it's congress that gets to make the decision about whether to go to war. and, ultimately, that's a judgment about the troops. we don't want to put our troops in harm's way unless there is deliberation in front of the american people about whether it's important. now a president can act unilaterally to stop-- defend against an ongoing attack or an imminent threat.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator tim kaine: but if it's more than that, it's supposed to be for congress, because congress will have this debate in a way that the american public will be informed of the stakes. and then if we debate and vote at the end of the day--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator tim kaine: --then it's fair to ask our men and women in uniform to risk their lives and health. but if we're not willing to do that, or if the president tries to rush to war and escalate, then you run the risk of making mistakes that are just so fatal in their consequences you can hardly ever, you know, undo them.\n\nmargaret brennan: the president says he doesn't want to go to war. i want to get to that authorization of use of force.\n\nsenator tim kaine: yep.\n\nmargaret brennan: we went back and we looked, and-- and the original aumf from 2001, and then there's one in '02, but in the wake of the al qaeda attacks on this country, that was the premise for this authorization congress gave at the right time.\n\nsenator tim kaine: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: it has-- was then used over the past almost twenty years to send troops to libya, turkey, georgia, syria, iraq, afghanistan, yemen, eritrea, ethiopia, djibouti, somalia, kenya, the philippines, cuba. there are democratic presidents. why hasn't any party made a full-throated effort to get a new authorization for military force?\n\nsenator tim kaine: well, margaret, as you know, i have been working on this since i came to the senate, and i have the same concern. when i came to the senate in 2013, i criticized president obama for taking us into military action in libya without congressional authorization, for going on isis in iraq and syria without congressional authorization. i will say this, when i started on this crusade six, seven years ago, very few people were interested in it. but in the last year, the good news is finally, members of both parties and in both houses have started to step up and take the congressional responsibility seriously. i do think we have to rewrite and redo the 2001 authorization that authorize us to wage war against non-state terrorist groups--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator tim kaine: --that are connected to the perpetrators--\n\nmargaret brennan: but-- but what--\n\nsenator tim kaine: --of the 9/11 attack.\n\nmargaret brennan: --what you're proposing now and you happen--\n\nsenator tim kaine: here's-- yeah, here's what i'm proposing now is that--\n\nmargaret brennan: --you're working with senator lee on it. but i just want to point out that there does seem to still be a carve-out for imminent threats. how--\n\nsenator tim kaine: and there should be. so, sen-- senator--\n\nmargaret brennan: --how would that not stop what the president just did?\n\nsenator tim kaine: well, senator lee and i are basically trying to restore this to its constitutional place, so we have-- we have a resolution that would basically say no war against iran unless congress, specifically, votes to authorize it. but we do state, as you point out, the president can defend the nation against an imminent threat, and that is existing law. that's-- the constitutional framers clearly understood that. we're skeptical of the evidence that this president has put on the table about imminent threat. that's why we're challenging the briefers and that's why we're challenging the president. but at the end of the day, i think this is less about the president than it is about congress. congresses of both parties for a very long time--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator tim kaine: --have hidden under their desks rather than have votes about war. votes about war are tough. i-- i've cast two of them in the foreign relations committee. fundamentally different than any vote you'll ever cast.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator tim kaine: and so many members of congress, what they want to do is hide under their desk, let the president just do whatever the president wants, and then they think they can escape accountability for the consequences of war.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator tim kaine: it's time to go back to what the framers envisioned. we shouldn't send our best and brightest into harm's way if congress doesn't have the guts to-- to have a debate and have a vote.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. senator kaine, thank you for laying out your case. you-- you were persuasive enough to get senator mike lee on board with this, and he joins us now.\n\nsenator, thanks for sticking with us. i know we had some problems with the uplink there, but we can see and hear you now just fine. what senator kaine, essentially, said here is no elected official wanted to get their hands dirt-- dirty and go on the record to vote for a war, which is why congress is allowed for this to continue without a new vote on an aumf. can you get other republicans on board with this beyond yourself and rand paul?\n\nsenator mike lee: yes, we can, and i believe we will. look, my grievance here is not with the president of the united states. he's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the constitution. it's not even really as much with the briefers, even though, i didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with congress. congress is the problem. we have to remember that this isn't just about this president or this war. this is about the future question of what any president can do to get us into any war. over many decades, congresses and white houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of congress to wash their hands of it--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator mike lee: --to step away and say, this isn't our problem and we have created this problem. we created the day-- (audio cut) of a full explanation.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. senator, can you hear me?\n\nsenator mike lee: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay, good.\n\nsenator mike lee: pretty fine, thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: we had some interruption there. you spoke to the president. have you received any private assurance that congress would be consulted if he plans to take future military action against iran?\n\nsenator mike lee: yes. and it's always implicit that we will be consulted. i always want to make sure that any step that is taken is either authorized by one of the aumfs in question in '02 or '01, or that there is some indication that the strike in question is necessary in order to repel an imminent or actual attack on the united states. that's always the question. and that's one of the reasons why i'm co-sponsoring tim-- tim kaine's resolution is to make clear--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator mike lee: --that neither the '01 nor the '02 authorization can be read fairly to authorize a war against iran.\n\nmargaret brennan: but this was-- there are things short of war. there are-- is hostile activity. there is, you know, a targeted strike like this. and-- and what you are supporting here, this resolution, there is still a carve-out for an imminent threat. so how would that stop the administration from doing again what it just did?\n\nsenator mike lee: well, anytime we have something like this and we've signaled in advance that it's not covered by an existing aumf, then, yeah, we're-- we're relying on the good faith use of a commander-in-chief power by the president. this is not a new precedent; it's not-- it's not contingent on or-- or rooted in-- in this presidential administration. this goes back to 1791 when george washington pointed out that it's okay for the president to act in order to repel an actual or imminent attack--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator mike lee: --without authorization from congress. but he also noted that it's important that any sustained military effort does have to be authorized.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator lee, thank you for joining us. next time, i hope you're here sitting across from me so we can see and hear each other more clearly next time.\n\nwe'll be back in a moment with former secretary of state john kerry.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we go now to dubuque, iowa, and the presidential campaign trail where former secretary of state john kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former vice president joe biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background. good morning to you, mister secretary.\n\njohn kerry (former secretary of state/@johnkerry): sorry about that. good morning, margaret. good to be with you.\n\nmargaret brennan: i-- i want to pick up kind of where we just left off with-- with the two senators. you know you-- you've been touting joe biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. bernie sanders, his opponent, has-- has taken that on as a reason essentially, not to specifically focusing in on biden's vote to help authorize the-- the war in iraq. he called it appalling that after eighteen years, joe biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong on the iraq war, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history. given what you know about the region and how iran was, essentially, empowered by that, why-- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?\n\njohn kerry: well, i think i-- i-- in fact, margaret, i think that bernie, regrettably, is distorting joe's record in the following sense. i mean he doesn't have what joe biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. i-- i think that-- that i know very well what joe's position was because i answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04. and it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy; that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. and, ultimately, we learned, as joe did and i did, that the intelligence was distorted. so joe spoke out and criticized. joe was against what they were doing. the vote was not a vote, specifically, to go to war. it was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me. and i think we were let down and joe has said many times that it was a mistake, obviously, to trust the words of the administration who didn't follow through on what they said they were going to do. and i invite you to go back, read my speech on the floor and others--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\njohn kerry: --where i said this is not a vote, specifically, to let the president go to war. so i think bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there. i understand that but i think the vice president has unparalleled--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njohn kerry: --demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the foreign relations committee and as vice president. and he, in my judgment, is the one person running for president--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\njohn kerry: --who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the united states.\n\nmargaret brennan: well--\n\njohn kerry: joe has told the truth. people know that. and i think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very, very delicate time--\n\nmargaret brennan: well--\n\njohn kerry: --when foreign policy experience--\n\nmargaret brennan: it is--\n\njohn kerry: --is, in fact, a premium.\n\nmargaret brennan: it is. and iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. but, virtually, every single democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. there's-- some would say a shell of it left now. shouldn't voters expect more out of a iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?\n\njohn kerry: well, joe biden is, in fact, providing more, which is to recognize that-- that it's not enough just to go back to where we were because, obviously, circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years. and-- and what-- what vice president biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement, which was always contemplated. margaret, you were there. you're an expert at this. you know exactly what the truth is about it. we were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate yemen, hezbollah, threats against israel--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njohn kerry: --the regional question of trafficking of arms. and-- and so vice president biden understands that now has to also be front and center--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\njohn kerry: --as you-- as you revive the agreement. but the truth is, france, germany--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\njohn kerry: --britain, china, russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it's the strongest, most transparent, most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet--\n\nmargaret brennan: well--\n\njohn kerry: --and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until president trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, the president--\n\njohn kerry: and everything--\n\nmargaret brennan: --the president's going on the--\n\njohn kerry: --that's happened in the last days--\n\nmargaret brennan: --going on the-- the attack on that deal this morning, specifically, mentioning you. perhaps, not a surprise. but, you know, i-- i know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions, gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program. there was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different, separate dispute. the president this week put blame on the administration, your-- the administration you served on with, essentially, helping to provide money to the irgc. i want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to cnbc when you were asked about how iran would spend the money.\n\njohn kerry (u.s. secretary of state/january 2016/cnbc): i think that some of it will end up in the hands of the irgc or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. you know, to some degree i'm-- i'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that could be prevented. but i can tell you this: right now we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. i'm sure at some point some of it will.\n\nmargaret brennan: i remember talking to you at the time. money is fungible.\n\njohn kerry: sure.\n\nmargaret brennan: why, though, did you think--\n\njohn kerry: absolutely. money is fungible.\n\nmargaret brennan: --that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of-- of what would happen with that money?\n\njohn kerry: well, what i was really saying, i think, first of all, margaret, you are an expert at this. you were there. you know that the president's tweet is a lie. and the president tweeted this morning, because i am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. you and the media, i think, need to call a lie a lie. you know--\n\nmargaret brennan: mister secretary, i asked you that question in 2015, too.\n\njohn kerry: --they didn't get a hundred and fifty billion dollars. no, no, no. but let me just finish. you know-- yes. and i'll-- i'll answer that. i was saying, clearly, some money from the budget of iran is going to go to the irgc. it always has. that's no surprise. but the truth is and-- and president trump-- i-- i-- well, he probably doesn't know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the congress that very, very little money actually went to the irgc at all. most of the money went to the economy of iran, which is precisely what i said and what we all said. so, the irgc has never had a problem getting money, margaret. but the fact is donald trump keeps saying they got a hundred and fifty billion dollars. a lie. he keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. it did not. his own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. so, you know, we have to stop--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njohn kerry: --dealing with questions on donald trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. the fact is--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\njohn kerry: --that mo-- the vast proportion of that money--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\njohn kerry: --went to the economy of iran and they're always going to be funding the irgc. there was no question about that.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\njohn kerry: and the irgc budget has not gone up markedly as a result--\n\nmargaret brennan: okay.\n\njohn kerry: --of what happened with the agreement, period.\n\nmargaret brennan: mister secretary, thank you for joining us. i want to take a break because we have a report from iran.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizabeth palmer has been reporting from tehran all week. yesterday, she and her team were unexpectedly asked to leave by the iranian authorities and have now departed iran. before they left she filed this reporter's notebook.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nelizabeth palmer: this week ended with the unthinkable, iran admitted to shooting down a passenger plane killing everyone on board. but it had begun with the unknowable, what iran would do to avenge the killing by america of its most revered military hero, qasem soleimani.\n\nthis is not just a mourning procession, it's a political message.\n\nin all my years of covering iran, i have never seen such high-stakes drama. javad zarif, iran's foreign minister, warned the u.s. revenge was coming.\n\nmohammad javad zarif (tuesday): in a clear and proportionate.\n\nelizabeth palmer (tuesday): when?\n\nmohammad javad zarif (tuesday): as we choose.\n\nelizabeth palmer: they chose that very night. iranian missiles fell on two u.s. bases in iraq.\n\ndavid martin: a rocket attack was launched against the al asad air base.\n\nelizabeth palmer: the world held its breath.\n\npresident donald trump (wednesday): the fact that we have this great military equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. we do not want to use it.\n\nelizabeth palmer: but with no casualties, america held its fire. and the two old enemies appeared to call it a draw. ordinary tehranis heading out in the first real snowfall of the season called it a relief.\n\nwere you relieved when he said there would not be another american attack?\n\nwoman: yes. i sleep very--\n\nelizabeth palmer: well?\n\nwoman: very well.\n\nelizabeth palmer: but another bombshell was about to burst.\n\nmajor garrett: cbs news has learned that u.s. officials are confident that iran shot down a ukrainian jetliner.\n\nelizabeth palmer: on wednesday morning, wreckage and bodies from ukrainian airlines flight 752 lay strewn across iran's western suburbs. by friday when we managed to reach the site, there was little left, even for the scavengers.\n\nlocal people say that yesterday, thursday, around lunch time, trucks, cranes showed up and took most of the pieces that were here away.\n\namid rumors of a cover-up, world leaders called for an international investigation and the victims' families prayed for answers to soothe their grief. the answer came suddenly in a stunning tv address that said iran's army had shot down the plane by mistake. it was a huge admission for this proud and prickly country, which may have appeased critics outside iran but it's inflamed them at home. protests erupted in tehran last night, crowds of students who despise the government for its corruption and ineptitude. iran starts next week not only in conflict with the u.s. but also with itself.\n\n(crowd protesting)\n\n(end vt)\n\nmargaret brennan: elizabeth palmer reporting from tehran.\n\nwe'll be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you for watching. until next week, for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan.
victories by the two democrats in georgia's senate runoff elections could mean a third stimulus check for americans this spring, according to analysts. that would provide crucial financial support for households that this month are receiving $600 payments directed by the most recent relief bill — an effort that has been criticized by both democrats and some republicans as doing too little to help families that are struggling through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\ncbs news projects that democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock have defeated incumbent republican senators kelly loeffler and david perdue. the surprise outcome will result in a 50-50 split between senate democrats and republicans, giving vice president-elect kamala harris the tiebreaking vote. that will ease passage of another stimulus relief bill, which president-elect joe biden has previously said he supports, according to political and financial analysts.\n\nanother so-called economic impact payment would come on the heels of the most recent relief measure, a $900 billion bill that president donald trump delayed and criticized the $600 payments as ridiculously low. democrats and some republicans had supported lifting the checks to $2,000 per person, but the effort failed due to opposition from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell.\n\na big question is whether lawmakers might push for $2,000 or $1,400 cash payments, with the latter representing the difference between the $600 checks and the quashed effort to boost them to $2,000 in the most recent bill. on january 10, mr. biden tweeted that $600 is is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table.\n\nwe need $2,000 stimulus checks, he added.\n\n$600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. we need $2,000 stimulus checks. — joe biden (@joebiden) january 11, 2021\n\nwe expect growing anticipation that democrats will pursue additional stimulus, with a $2,000 check (or at least the remaining $1,400) as a leading item, ed mills, an analyst with investment bank raymond james, said in a report following the georgia election.\n\nbiden: latest aid a down payment\n\nmr. biden has described the $900 billion stimulus bill passed last month as a down payment on a more comprehensive relief package. that could translate into a new package ranging from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, according to heights securities analyst hunter hammond.\n\nthe debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in washington. it's about real lives. hardworking americans need help, and they need it now. georgia — you have the power to make it happen. vote. pic.twitter.com/yfbbk1yaem — joe biden (@joebiden) january 5, 2021\n\na sweetened stimulus package would likely come in march, hammond and mills predict. that's because the most recent relief measure extended unemployment programs until mid-march, which puts pressure on congress to act on additional financial support by that cutoff to continue jobless benefits for millions of unemployed americans.\n\ndemocrats are likely to push for a new round of checks worth $2,000, hammond predicted, noting that both mr. biden, as well as warnock and ossoff, had campaigned on the issue. while stumping for the candidates ahead of this week's vote, mr. biden said their election would help get $2,000 checks out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble.\n\n8 million more poor people\n\neven with previous stimulus aid, 8 million americans have slipped into poverty during the coronavirus pandemic. millions of others are experiencing a range of hardships, from food insecurity to trouble paying their bills, after the crisis upended the economy.\n\nthe $600 checks issued by the treasury department last month may last the neediest americans no more than six weeks, according to financial-services app earnin. the firm found that people who had been living paycheck to paycheck and who got the initial $1,200 checks last year spent their money within one week.\n\nsome economists say much more funding is needed beyond the recent $900 billion package to help the economy until coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed, which may not be until this summer or fall.\n\nas much as $3 trillion could be needed to ensure a swift economic recovery, according to the economic policy institute. the left-leaning think tank noted that the most recent stimulus package omitted funding for state and local governments, which have seen a plunge in tax revenue due to the crisis.\n\nalthough the stimulus checks are helping households weather the crisis, most economists view other relief measures as more effective — especially programs that target people who are currently suffering a financial hit, such as unemployment benefits. that's because the cash payments are distributed to almost every middle- and low-income household, regardless of whether they have been impacted financially by the crisis.\n\nchecks are generally less potent in supporting spending than unemployment benefits, wrote oxford economics chief u.s. economist gregory daco in a recent research report. he added that the $900 billion relief bill will likely fall short of what is needed to prevent a rough winter.
the following is a transcript of an interview with sen. bernie sanders that aired sunday, march 1, 2020, on face the nation.\n\n\n\nmargaret brennan: we turn now to senator bernie sanders. he is on the campaign trail in norfolk, virginia. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: is this now a two man race?\n\nsen. sanders: well, all i can say is we have won the popular vote in iowa. we won the new hampshire primary. we won the nevada caucus. we lost last night. we're looking forward to super tuesday. i think we've got a great chance to win in california, in texas, in massachusetts and a number of states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: south carolina is the first southern state. does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like virginia and- and north carolina? will joe biden really challenge you there?\n\nsen. sanders: well, we're going to see. i mean, i think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in virginia. i think we've got a shot in north carolina. all i can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. those are ideas, margaret, that i think are resonating all across this country. i think we have an excellent chance to do well on tuesday and to win the democratic nomination.\n\nmargaret brennan: joe biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. we know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in february. that's a significant number. what do you think that does for you going into super tuesday? what edge?\n\nsen. sanders: well, margaret, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. we don't have a super pac like joe biden. i don't go to rich people's homes like joe biden. i think joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. what we have done is received more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. this is a campaign of working people and by working people. and i'm extraordinarily proud of that. but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.\n\nmargaret brennan: your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that michael bloomberg has offered. he said he'd extend it to any party nominee. do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nsen. sanders: well, look, mr. bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. all i can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would accept it?\n\nsen. sanders: --whether conservative or progressive, is- i didn't say that. what i would say--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsen. sanders:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. right now, we are confident, margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you are a democratic socialist. you have never officially entered the democratic party. in fact, you constantly criticize democratic establishment. so how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify democrats and challenge president trump?\n\nsen. sanders: well, two points. i'm a member of the democratic leadership. i've been in the democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of vermont, where i live, i am supported by democrats and have won the democratic primary. but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to democrats, and to more than a few republicans. look, we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america. all over this country, margaret, and i have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. they can't afford childcare. they can't afford healthcare. they're scared to death about their retirement. they want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. that's how you win. you put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. that is what we're doing. no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. that's how you beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. sanders: we're beating them in battleground states like pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan. we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: you have rallies planned out in california. there is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the west coast. is it safe for you? have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nsen. sanders: well, actually, we have. i mean, that's a very fair question. and my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. and right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in california, but in utah, minnesota and other states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the un says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?\n\nsen. sanders: yeah, i do. i mean, they have a lot of money. they have a lot of power. look, i'm jewish and i'm very proud of my jewish heritage. as a kid, i spent time in israel. i am not in- anti-israel. i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people. but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel, but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well. you've got 70 percent youth unemployment in gaza. people can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. it is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even handed policy.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. sanders: so, i am pro-israel. i am pro-palestinian. i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you on foreign policy. the president just authorized a deal with the taliban. what do you think of that? because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of u.s. troops.\n\nsen. sanders: well, i don't have enough details and the- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the afghan government. we don't know what's going to happen. one of the difficulties, to be very honest, margaret, in dealing with trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in afghanistan. but it is my view that the united states and i- i speak as somebody who helped lead the opposition to getting us into the war in iraq. it is my view that we've got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in america sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care, we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. senator sanders, thank you for joining us.

and this is face the nation.\n\nwashington may have a new congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.\n\npresident donald trump: you can call it the schumer or the pelosi or the trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. just words.\n\nmargaret brennan: but words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the u.s. government remains shuttered for the third week. president trump warns it could last months or years and democrats dig in.\n\nnancy pelosi: we're not a doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. the democratic whip, senator dick durbin of illinois and republican senator lindsey graham of south carolina.\n\nkevin mccarthy: nancy pelosi, i extend to you this gavel.\n\nmargaret brennan: in the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth congress gavels in, nancy pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as democrats take control of the house and usher in the most diverse congress in history. a panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the president.\n\nrepresentative max rose: this is a national disgrace.\n\nmargaret brennan: and it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. one high-profile democrat jumps in.\n\nelizabeth warren: hello, council bluffs. whoo.\n\nmargaret brennan: and other potential candidates near their own decisions.\n\nall that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on face the nation.\n\ngood morning and welcome to face the nation. top white house officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. so far their talks have yielded nothing. yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. with no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.\n\nwe begin today with senate democratic whip dick durbin who is in springfield, illinois. senator durbin is among a group of senators talking to the white house about how to end this shutdown. senator, welcome to face the nation. the president said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. if he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will senate democrats do?\n\nsenator dick durbin (minority whip/@senatordurbin/d-illinois): well, i can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. this is the first president in history who shut down his own government. unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. as of next friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. this is totally unnecessary. and that's a point we've made over and over to this president, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for america.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the president says he could bypass congress by declaring this national emergency. so what would you do if he-- he went that route?\n\nsenator dick durbin: i can just tell you, i don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, i'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.\n\nmargaret brennan: we described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. you were in the room with the president on friday. did you hear any points of agreement?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. but what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. this gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the republican senate leader, mitch mcconnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. he's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the president. he is part of a branch of government and a leader in the senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. as of last night, three republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.\n\nmargaret brennan: so from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. how close are we to ending this shutdown?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, i can't say that we're close because president's made it clear he doesn't care. he's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. it was stunning to hear a president of the united states say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. but that is his position. think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the treasury department has been shut down, the internal revenue service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.\n\nmargaret brennan: according to the white house, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among democrats, right? they point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? what-- what is your response to that?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, i would just say, do you remember the president's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the mexicans. how many times did he say that to the american people? that is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, he now says--\n\nsenator dick durbin: talk about-- or--\n\nmargaret brennan: --it doesn't have to be concrete.\n\nsenator dick durbin: --those fences and barriers. well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. and when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? he basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. that is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which democrats certainly want.\n\nmargaret brennan: have you seen the more specific financial request that the white house says they were giving to democrats?\n\nsenator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator dick durbin: they did not cross the border. the solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. and this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.\n\nmargaret brennan: it sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?\n\nsenator dick durbin: i don't see that. but i will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. the president could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. but he said, no, i'm going to shut down my own government. that's what he's done.\n\nmargaret brennan: there has been speculation and-- and our next guest, senator lindsey graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for daca, sort of, a trade here. the president stood in the rose garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the supreme court rules on daca before he comes to any kind of proposal here. do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? and is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?\n\nsenator dick durbin: listen, senator graham and i could not be more different politically. he's a conservative republican from south carolina; i'm a progressive democrat from illinois. but we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. and a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the president on january, the eleventh, 2018, i do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with daca and many other aspects of the reform and the president rejected it. he said, i'll go with my approach. his approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the united states senate. it wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. so we're in a position now where when the president makes these claims and promises a lot of us, i hope i could speak for senator graham, are a little bit skeptical.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, thank you very much, senator.\n\nwe will turn now to south carolina republican senator lindsey graham who joins us from clemson. senator graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the president, often shares his advice. senator, did you speak to the president this weekend about this shutdown?\n\nsenator lindsey graham (r-south carolina/@lindseygrahamsc): yeah. it was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. dick durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. we're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice, not support ice. we're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. as long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. the president will compromise but he will not capitulate. so that's where we're at.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the people in the room are your colleague senator durbin along with--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: he's not in the room.\n\nmargaret brennan: --along with speaker pelosi. you don't--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: he's not in the room. neither one of them are in the room.\n\nmargaret brennan: he was on friday. he was--\n\nsenator lindsey graham. neither one--\n\nmargaret brennan: --on friday with the president.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: they sent staff. they sent staff people to do the negotiation. the vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.\n\nmargaret brennan: today.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: dick durbin is a good guy. he's a reasonable guy. but nancy pelosi has made progress. she's gone from not a penny to a dollar. nancy pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. president trump sees it as real. until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. the president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. it will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. and every plan i've supported in the past with dick durbin has had money for physical barriers--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --including walls and fences. except now when trump is president.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --when they're going to get paid. so--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? who gives you a dollar for a wall when the democratic party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? we're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. we'll negotiate with dick durbin but i'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the border patrol agents a bunch of nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. these caravans have changed everything. the reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. we've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from central america.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: and it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only god knows what they go through to get here. the democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--\n\nmargaret brennan: but what about--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --until that changes there's--\n\nmargaret brennan: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the coast guard? who are not going to get paid.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. they're being held hostage. they're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. they're being held hostage by people--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you don't want to--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --who accuse them--\n\nmargaret brennan: --open the government and then continue talking?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. the goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. that ice is not the problem, it's the solution. the goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. it's to implement policies--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --democrats have voted for in the past on president trump's watch. we're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. we'll have wall as part of a border security plan. we're going nowhere. wall plus daca plus tps makes sense. but you'll never convince me--\n\nmargaret brennan: is the president open to--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --that we don't need a wall.\n\nmargaret brennan: but is the president open--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah i think so.\n\nmargaret brennan: --to that compromise you just floated there?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. i really believe that.\n\nmargaret brennan: that daca and tps for a wall?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. but what he's not open to is a lecture by the speaker of the house. i'll give you a dollar. he's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being gestapo agents gassing children. he's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. so if you bring dick durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm. but let's dig into that--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: if the left is going to--\n\nmargaret brennan: --because that's significant what you said there--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: okay.\n\nmargaret brennan: --if you think the president--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah i think he is open to it.\n\nmargaret brennan: --is indeed open to a daca for wall trade here because he stood in the rose garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: okay. here's what he's open to. he's open to getting his wall money. we need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. he has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. so how can you say he's not open minded to it. here's what i think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. and i think we can put on the table tps reform. there's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. i'd like to deal with that problem and i would--\n\nmargaret brennan: when is that going to be put on the table? that offer.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. we're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, i don't see anything happening.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've worked with the president's son-in-law jared kushner on criminal justice reform.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: he is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of daca for wall.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yes, he is.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the president really seemed to shoot that down in the rose garden the other day.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i am here to tell you--\n\nmargaret brennan: when would we see that put on the table? is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: when you see dick durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. when you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. when you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. when that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal democrats who don't see a border security problem. they see their own government being the problem--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --not the illegal immigrant. until that changes we'll never get anywhere. there is a deal to be had here--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --but it will include a wall. and if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you about syria. i know you watch the region and you had criticized the president's decision to pull out. the national security adviser john bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a u.s. drawdown and it'll be dependent on turkey agreeing not to slaughter our kurdish allies. it sounds like he's describing--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --an indefinite timeline of u.s. troops staying in syria.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: well, i had lunch with the president last week and i came away a bit encourage. there are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. we want to make sure that when we leave the kurds do not get slaughtered. and i don't trust turkey to take care of the kurds. it'd be like putin trying to police assad. that didn't work well. we need a plan to protect the kurds from turkey and others. we need to make sure isis doesn't come back once they're defeated and iran is not the biggest winner. if you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which i think we can, then count me in. but those three things have to be--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --accomplished for us to successfully leave syria. and the president's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. don't let iran get the oil fields, don't let the turks-- turks slaughter the kurds, and don't let isis come back. i think i share the goal of the president to withdraw our forces. let's just do it smartly.\n\nmargaret brennan: is this an admission that the president made a mistake?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. president obama ended the operations in iraq against sound military advice. the president's getting sound military advice about the status of the kurds--what will happen with iran if we leave too soon. and the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for re-evaluating what he's doing. he hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. and president obama never would do that. and you saw what happened when a president shuts people out. this president's not shutting people out. he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator graham, thank you for joining us.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: we will be back in a moment. don't go away.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: four freshman democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in congress. we spoke with representative jahana hayes, a former national teacher of the year from my home state of connecticut and that state's first african-american woman to serve in congress. congressman max rose, an army captain from new york who earned a bronze star and a purple heart in afghanistan, he then went on to work in the brooklyn district attorney's office. congresswoman mikie sherrill represents new jersey. she flew helicopter missions in the navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. and representative colin allred, who's from texas. he's a former nfl player who later worked for president obama's department of housing and urban development. we started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.\n\nall of you just came to washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. all of you took a vote to reopen the government but leader mcconnell in the senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. where do we go from here, congresswoman?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill (d-new jersey/@repsherrill): well, i don't think it's a waste of time. we voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the senate, within the last month. and so i think what we're asking congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.\n\nmargaret brennan: but passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the president has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. do you see, congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?\n\nrepresentative colin allred (d-texas/@repcolinallred): well, let's be very clear. he doesn't want border security. we have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. there is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. a five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. there's a lot of things we can do instead of that.\n\nmargaret brennan: is it just a matter of semantics here? border fence, some kind of barrier? i mean is there movement for democrats to support what the president in some way is asking for?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, let me say, i'm from texas. we have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? i mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. are you seeing that in your district?\n\nrepresentative max rose (d-new york/@ repmaxrose): absolutely. look we all are. we all have federal workers in our district. this is a national disgrace. there's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. but we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, speaker pelosi has called the wall an immorality. she said, no way, no how, is the president going to get money for it. that's a pretty hard line position versus where the president is. do you find any room for compromise in the middle?\n\nrepresentative max rose: the room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. we don't--\n\nmargaret brennan: you think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i think that we have serious issues throughout the country. the point here is that what i'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. what, you want to also bring horses back to the united states cavalry?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: bring some rowboats to the navy? we can put trump's name on it. this is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? let's get back to work. it's why we all ran and i know it's what the republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. and i promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. this is not political suicide.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for democrats. do you see your-- your fellow house members getting on board?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes (d-connecticut/@jahanahayesct): well i think-- i apologize i lost my voice yesterday. but i think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. we have to get to work. we cannot keep operating in hard lines. we cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. we have to move. that's why we were elected. that's what we were sent here to do. we have to get back to work.\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would be open--\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: absolutely.\n\nmargaret brennan: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: i think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.\n\nmargaret brennan: so would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for democrats, like protections for dreamers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, i think it's important to see what's in the package. and it's- i think it's hard for any of us to say. i think all of us at this table came to congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. we're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. we need some bend from the other side as well.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. so, stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: new york democrat alexandria ocasio-cortez has made a name for herself taking on republicans in her own party. tonight, she sits down with 60 minutes. here's part of her interview.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nanderson cooper (60 minutes): you're willing to compromise?\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): yeah, absolutely. absolutely. it's just about what we choose to compromise. my personal opinion. and i know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. and--\n\nanderson cooper (60 minutes): the democratic party has lost so much.\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): i think so. i think-- i think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with mitch mcconnell, whether it's compromising on climate change i think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am i open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. absolutely.\n\n(end vt)\n\nmargaret brennan: and you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 minutes.\n\nnext up on face the nation, we'll have more of our panel of new house members.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we continue our conversation now with our panel of new house members. earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in washington.\n\nanother topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. the house oversight chairman, elijah cummings, said that's premature. what do you all think? is that too soon?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i-- i think so. i'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the fbi finished their investigation. i think we've got to let mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.\n\nmargaret brennan: you're waiting on the mueller report?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i am.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: it's absolutely premature. this is way too early to be talking about this. we need to let the investigation run its course. and i just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the tone of this conversation? one of your colleagues, congresswoman from michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. what do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, i'm from staten island. i have no problem with profanity, okay? well what-- what i have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. i-- i-- i certainly object to it.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: premature.\n\nmargaret brennan: premature.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: the gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. congresswoman, as we said, you're from connecticut. in your home state that was the site of the sandy hook shooting. i know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. what is it that you think can actually get done? what are you going to try to do about gun control?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: well, i think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. i think we have to have background checks. we have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.\n\nmargaret brennan: so would you commend the trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes. yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: but not enough?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: it's a first step.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's a first step.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman rose, you served in afghanistan as we said in your introduction. both president obama and president trump have wanted to draw down troops--\n\nrepresentative max rose: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: --from that war zone. what do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. so the key here in afghanistan, because we saw in iraq, the invasion of iraq was absolutely foolish. but then we did a speedy withdrawal, which i believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. we cannot afford to do the same thing in afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. and i intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.\n\nmargaret brennan: and that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--\n\nrepresentative max rose: no. it-- it absolutely isn't. but we have been at war in afghanistan now for seventeen years. to put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the united states military who were born after 9/11. and we cannot just have perpetual war. but we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. we need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--\n\nmargaret brennan: that sounds like what the trump administration is suggesting.\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, what i just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. i believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. i don't want to see americans put at risk. i've watched loved ones get hurt. i don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. but i just want us to have a long-term strategy--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the united states military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. what do you think? do you support not just afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: you know what i would add to what max is saying, and what i think is lost a little bit in the discussion of trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. we are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and nato, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. and so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, i think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you support a drawdown?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but i don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in syria we're just pulling out.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: you have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman, this week, not only a new week in congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- i know, get ready.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: if-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, i know you're sort of, wow.\n\nrepresentative max rose: exhausted.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's exhausting, but it's beginning.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: you know, i-- i think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. and there are certainly lessons you can learn, i think, from some of our races. i think there--\n\nmargaret brennan: like what?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: i think-- i think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. i think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. i think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and i think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you have anyone in mind from your home state?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, i certainly like my former boss, julian castro--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. and-- and we have a lot of political talent in texas, so.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the rest of you?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i'm supporting mikie.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrepresentative max rose: but if i could just have one important thing. it's obvious that election season's starting again. but what we can't do is campaign in the halls of congress. when it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say oh, i don't want to give this president a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.\n\nmargaret brennan: is that what you think is happening now in the house?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i think that there's the potential that it could happen. we've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. there's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? everybody is running on anti-corruption now. but in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. if all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the american people are going to suffer.\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i think if we're going to win as democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. the way we took back the majority of the house is through districts like mine. the eleventh district of new jersey, where i ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. these are things that the majority of americans agree on and the democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.\n\nmargaret brennan: and all of that requires working with a republican senate--\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --and a republican president.\n\nrepresentative max rose: yes, sure.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: and all of you are willing to do that?\n\nrepresentative max rose: but here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. it's just different political parties run-- won. if you think about what donald trump ran on, okay? if you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, i know. but he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect medicare and social security, draining the swamp. we ran on many of those same things, the american people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. and now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.\n\nmargaret brennan: thank you very much for this conversation. i wish you all luck as lawmakers. welcome to washington.\n\nwe'll be right back with our reporters' panel.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, dan balz is the chief correspondent for the washington post, ed o'keefe is the political correspondent right here at cbs news, shannon pettypiece is a white house reporter for bloomberg news and mark landler covers the white house and foreign policy for-- at the new york times. so, ed, i'll start with you. did you hear any points of agreement or were democrats and republicans just talking past each other on the show?\n\ned o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and i think elsewhere as well. look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. we can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. maybe that's the delay. but what are we on, day sixteen now? and-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ned o'keefe: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. we got a ways to go. congress doesn't get back till tuesday night, wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. i am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.\n\nmargaret brennan: you had senator durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. you had senator graham saying no wall, no deal. is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, dan?\n\ndan balz (the washington post/@danbalz): there's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.\n\nmargaret brennan: whatever that means.\n\ndan balz: and-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. so whatever that means. and i think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. it feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. i win, you lose.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ndan balz: that's never the way these kinds of things end. we'll see whether this is a different situation.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, and the senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. but it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?\n\ndan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.\n\nmargaret brennan: shannon, i mean, is that the calculus? we didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of american workers--\n\nshannon pettypiece (bloomberg news/@spettypi): yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --who are waiting for paychecks.\n\nshannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.\n\nmargaret brennan: mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the national security advisor in israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the syria policy. the president said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of u.s. troops in syria. what are people of the pentagon actually being told to do?\n\nmark landler (the new york times/@marklandler): well, it's-- it is interesting. it's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on december 19th when president trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. i think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the pentagon and i think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in syria. there's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the white house and the pentagon all along. the question i have now is, how in sync is the national security advisor--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmark landler: --with his own president. president trump just a few minutes ago on his way to camp david repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of syria soon. that's a very different message than what john bolton had in israel a few hours earlier. some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the turks would go after our kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, i think a lot of people in the pentagon are skeptical the turks can ever be relied on not to go after the kurds. so i think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. but i have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from president trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. he will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmark landler: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. his words meet reality on the ground and i think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah. it's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.\n\nmark landler: indeed.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.\n\nmark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.\n\nmargaret brennan: and that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the american people. more to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.\n\nwe'll be right back in a moment.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're back now with more from our reporters' panel. we saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. dan. and elizabeth warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. how do you see democrats defining themselves?\n\ndan balz: that-- that is such an interesting question because i think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on president trump in 2020, and i think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. we saw in iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for elizabeth warren. i think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. i think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like elizabeth warren or vice president biden, bernie sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. but there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. and my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.\n\nmargaret brennan: so lots of exploring without declaring, ed?\n\ned o'keefe: yeah. i mean, senator warren was the first-- second to do it actually, julian castro, the former hud secretary, was the first before christmas, and will make it official next weekend. but where is everybody else? you might ask. and-- and they are still mulling it. i think we have at least seven democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, governor inslee of washington state said this week he's still thinking about it. so you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, i'm still thinking about it. unless you think it's just empty talk, i-- i heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.\n\nmargaret brennan: this is biden.\n\ned o'keefe: this is biden. and biden said in response to her, what's her name? give me her number. he had an aide get her phone number. the next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think i should run? yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do i will volunteer for you. and he asked her all these reasons why. that happens. and they're all doing this. it's got to be tremendous for their ego. but whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can i stand up against somebody like elizabeth warren--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ned o'keefe: --who has a name id in the network. can i somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, i have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time i have to find a way to play in california, in georgia and all these other places because of early voting. it's going to be a tremendous competition and one that i think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but i think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.\n\nmargaret brennan: it-- it sounds there-- shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of congress--\n\ned o'keefe: oh, yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.\n\nshannon pettypiece: well, yeah. well, i mean, and-- we can talk about this. meanwhile, at the white house, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. i mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the white house is transitioning into 2020 mode. and while you have these democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to iowa, now you have a president trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. it's not the trump tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. they have raised millions and millions of dollars. they have a big data operation. they are out of the gate and running and the democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. so, i mean, that's what they're going to be up against. and they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the president might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. you might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. he was not one of those politicians who came to washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nshannon pettypiece: he-- he did what he said. and they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.\n\ned o'keefe: you know, to your point about campaigning in congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor republican candidates. to-- to watch those kinds of democrats now in congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, medicare for all, agreeing with the president maybe we should withdraw all our forces from syria.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ned o'keefe: it's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for president and their party. and it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.\n\nmargaret brennan: mark, i mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the president prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. you can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. afghanistan, when the president had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, wall street journal came down pretty hard on him.\n\nmark landler: yeah. no, the president said in essence that the soviet union has been right to invade afghanistan. he offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. he said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. and-- and he also attributed the collapse of the soviet union to their misadventures in afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of soviet union. but to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, i think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing american troops from foreign conflicts. i think it's--\n\nmargaret brennan: so did obama.\n\nmark landler: so did obama. and so do-- as you say many democrats. what i don't think has been tested maybe at least i'd love to see it--\n\nmargaret brennan: hm-mm.\n\nmark landler: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for president trump's base. we know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmark landler: and i think that also explains this decision before christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. i just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.\n\nmargaret brennan: good question. we'll be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you all for watching. until next week for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan.
rural america is no longer where many young college graduates want to settle, with some fleeing for urban centers like new york or san francisco. aside from the glamour of living in those locations, there may be another culprit for the rural brain drain that's occurring across the u.s.: student loan debt.\n\nadults with student loans are less likely to remain in rural areas than those without it, and adults with the highest student loan balances are the most likely to migrate to cities, according to new research from the federal reserve. that's contributing to a growing college attainment gap between urban and rural america, which has diverged from about 5 percentage points in 1970 to 14 percentage points in 2016.\n\nas fewer college-educated young people remain in rural locations, those regions become less attractive to other young grads. employers, for their part, increasingly are focusing on urban locations to recruit these workers. added to the mix is the pressure of the country's growing student loan debt, which places more pressure on grads to seek higher-paying jobs -- which are more plentiful in cities.\n\nright now we are experiencing the greatest opportunity gap between rural and urban places in history, said matt dunne, the founder of the hartland, vermont-based center on rural innovation, which is working on creating rural innovation hubs to develop entrepreneurship. people believe the only place you can have an aspirational job is to cram into already overcrowded cities that are facing housing crises rather than make your way in rural locations.\n\nthat creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, said dunne, who worked for google from a remote office in vermont before starting the center on rural innovation.\n\nrural america's student debt problem\n\nrural america is increasingly old, shrinking in population and falling behind when it comes to its share of educated residents. about 19 percent of rural residents held college degrees in 2016, compared with 33 percent of urban residents, a gap that's widened over the past few decades, the agriculture department said last year.\n\nto be sure, the federal reserve said it couldn't determine whether the student loan debt is causing young college grads to move to cities. nevertheless, the trend is notable: about half of rural residents who took out student loans remained in those areas six years later, compared with two-thirds of rural residents who didn't take out loans. and the grads with the most debt were the most likely to leave, they found.\n\nthere's a good reason why young workers with student loans would head for the big city. cumulative job growth since 2009 -- after the recession ended -- surged almost 14 percent in cities with at least 1 million residents, compared with 2.7 percent for rural areas and small cities, according to goldman sachs.\n\ncity wages\n\nworkers with college degrees earn far more in big cities, about $71,000 per year. but if they remain in rural areas, those college grads earn about $50,000 annually, goldman found.\n\nnot surprisingly, college grads with student debt had better financial outcomes than those who stayed in rural areas, the fed found. those big-city migrants are more likely to pay down their loans, less likely to default, and are more likely to become homeowners, they said.\n\nthe allure of higher pay and wider professional opportunities is enticing -- and hard for rural communities to compete with, dunne noted.\n\nthe general drumbeat is you have to go to urban locations, in particular tech centers, in order to have a new economy job, he said. that's accelerating the drive toward cities and the investment cycles in companies that are starting in cities. there's a notion you can't find talent in rural areas or smaller cities.\n\na divided america?\n\nthe trend is worsening the economic outcomes for rural residents while making resources -- like housing -- scarcer and more expensive in large cities, economists and policy experts say. it's also blamed for the widening political gap between rural regions and big coastal cities.\n\nany time you see a massive separation along demographic lines, it's not healthy, dunne said. you want to have diversity of skills, education and perspective in any part of the country.\n\nin many cases, americans who live in large cities would welcome an opportunity to move to a rural location, but may perceive smaller regions as lacking professional opportunities. almost one out of four urban residents aid they would like to move to a different community, with a third of those saying they'd like to find a rural community to live in, pew found in a 2018 study.\n\nloan forgiveness\n\ndunne, who credits his own lack of student loans with allowing him to return to vermont to begin his career, said he made a proposal in the state's last legislative session to create a program that would forgive up to $20,000 of student debt over two years for college grads who bought houses in rural parts of the state.\n\nthe benefit would not only be to encourage young people to look at rural places to live and work and raise a family, but it would improve their financial profile in order to get a bank loan, he said, adding that he was inspired by corporations who offer loan forgiveness incentives when hiring, which they've found to be effective recruiting tools.\n\nother communities have developed similar programs, such as marquette, kansas, which offers free land to people who agree to build a house in the rural town. and there are also loan forgiveness programs for health care professionals such as nurses who agree to work in rural areas.\n\neverything should be on the table in order to address this challenge, dunne said.
thomas s. monson, the president of the mormon church -- the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints -- died late tuesday at the age of 90, the church announced.\n\npresident @thomassmonson, 90, has passed away peacefully surrounded by family. pic.twitter.com/66qovriniw — the lds church (@ldschurch) january 3, 2018\n\nthe salt lake tribune notes that, during monson's nearly 10-year tenure … mormonism faced some of the most intense public scrutiny in its history -- from a divisive vote over gay marriage to high-profile mormon candidacies for president and a hotly debated policy for same-sex couples and their children. still, the private prophet stayed largely behind the scenes, showing up unexpectedly at funerals, comforting the bereaved, visiting the sick and, before her death, caring for his wife, frances.\n\ncbs salt lake city affiliate kutv reports the church issued a statement saying monson died at 10:01 pm in his home in salt lake city. he was with family at the time of his passing. he died at age 90 from causes incident to age. president monson ... leaves behind a legacy of service and good works. a successor is not expected to be formally chosen by the church's quorum of the twelve apostles until after president monson's funeral.\n\nprominent utah figures were quick to tweet tributes. among them:\n\npresident monson was among the greatest men i have ever known. service was his motto and humility his hallmark. countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. today, i join millions across the globe in mourning his passing. #ldschurch #utpol — senator hatch office (@senorrinhatch) january 3, 2018\n\nmy heart is filled with love for pres. monson. he touched countless lives, including my own, in a positive and sweet manner influencing good throughout the world. https://t.co/cxnzswmzp3 — jason chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) january 3, 2018\n\nfor more than 50 years, monson served in top leadership councils for the church - making him a well-known face and personality to multiple generations of mormons.\n\na church bishop at the age of 22, the salt lake city native became the youngest church apostle ever in 1963 at the age of 36. he served as a counselor for three church presidents before assuming the role of the top leader of the church in february 2008.\n\nmonson's job is expected to go to next longest-tenured member of the church's governing quorum of the twelve apostles, russell m. nelson, per church protocol.\n\nmonson's presidency was marked by his noticeably low profile during a time of intense publicity for the church, including the 2008 and 2012 campaigns of mormon mitt romney for u.s. president. monson's most public acts were appearances at church conferences and devotionals as well as dedications of church temples.\n\nmonson will also be remembered for his emphasis on humanitarian work; leading the faith's involvement in the passage of gay marriage ban in california in 2008; continuing the religion's push to be more transparent about its past; and lowering the minimum age for missionaries.\n\nmormons considered monson a warm, caring, endearing and approachable leader, said patrick mason, associate professor of religion at claremont graduate university in california. he was known for dropping everything to make hospital visits to people in need. his speeches at the faith's twice-yearly conferences often focused on parables of human struggles resolved through faith.\n\nhe put an emphasis on the humanitarian ethic of mormons, evidenced by his expansion of the church's disaster relief programs around the world, said armand mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at washington state university.\n\nmonson often credited his mother, gladys condie monson, for fostering his compassion. he said that during his childhood in the depression of the 1930s their house in salt lake city was known to hobos riding the railroads as a place to get a meal and a kind word.\n\npresident monson always seemed more interested in what we do with our religion rather than in what we believe, mauss said.\n\na world war ii veteran, monson served in the navy and spent a year overseas before returning to get a business degree at the university of utah and a master's degree in business administration from the church-owned brigham young university.\n\nbefore being tabbed to join the faith's church's governing quorum of the twelve apostles, monson worked for the church's secular businesses, primarily in advertising, printing and publishing including the deseret morning news.\n\nmonson married frances beverly johnson in 1948. the couple had three children, eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. frances died in 2013 at the age of 85.\n\nthroughout his life, monson was an avid fisherman who also raised homing pigeons, specifically, roller pigeons who twirled as they flew. he was known for his love of show tunes, boy scouts and the utah jazz.\n\nmonson's legacy will be tied to the religion's efforts to hold tight to its opposition of same-sex marriage while encouraging members to be more open and compassionate toward gays and lesbians as acceptance for lgbt people increased across the county.\n\nat monson's urging, mormons were vigorous campaign donors and volunteers in support of a measure to ban gay marriage in california in 2008. that prompted a backlash against the church that included vandalism of church buildings, protest marches and demonstrations outside church temples nationwide.\n\nin subsequent years, the church began utilizing a softer tone on the issue. in 2015, the church backed an anti-discrimination law in utah that gave unprecedented protections for gay and transgender people while also protecting religious freedoms.\n\nbut the religion came under fire again in the fall of 2015 when it banned baptisms for children living with gay parents, and instituted a requirement that those children disavow homosexual relationships before being allowed to serve a mission. the changes were designed to avoid putting children in a tug-of-war between their parents and church teachings, leaders said.\n\nthe revisions triggered anger, confusion and sadness for a growing faction of lgbt-supportive mormons who were buoyed in recent years by church leaders' calls for more love and understanding for lgbt members.\n\none of the most memorable moments of monson's tenure came in october 2012, when he announced at church conference that the minimum age to depart on missions was being lowered to 19 from 21 for women; and to 18 from 19 for men. the change triggered a historic influx of missionaries, and proved a milestone change for women by allowing many more to serve.\n\ntaking the lead from hinckley, monson also continued the church's push toward being more open about some of the most sensitive aspect of the faith's history and doctrine. a renovated church history museum reopened in 2015 with an exhibit acknowledging the religion's early polygamous practices, a year after the church published an essay that for the first time chronicled founder joseph smith's plural wives.\n\nother church essays issued during monson's tenure addressed other sensitive topics: sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that mormons are taught they will get their own planet in the afterlife.\n\nthe growth and globalization of the religion continued under monson, with membership swelling to nearly 15.9 million, with more than half outside the united states.\n\nthe mormon church was founded in 1830 in upstate new york by joseph smith, who claimed he was visited by god and jesus while praying in a grove of trees and was called to found the church. members are known as mormons because of the religion's keystone scripture, the book of mormon.\n\nmormons believe they are called to share the word of god, specifically their own message of the restored gospel, through their missionaries. there were 71,000 church missionaries serving around the world at the end of 2016.\n\nlike his predecessors, monson traveled the world, visiting countless countries to give speeches, dedicate temples and preach to latter-day saints. under his watch, 27 new temples were planned or built.\n\nmonson chose five new members to the quorum of the twelve apostles, a top-governing body that sets policy and runs the worldwide faith's business operations. all five were white and from utah - a fact that disappointed some mormons who wanted to see a minority or person from outside the u.s. selected to acknowledge the globalization of the church.\n\nthe man expected to take monson's seat, the 93-year-old nelson, has been a church apostle since april 1970. out of respect for monson, his appointment will not be officially named until after his funeral services.\n\nin keeping with tradition, nelson will choose two new counselors from the quorum of the twelve who will join him to form a three-person presidency that is the top of the religion's governing hierarchy. monson's two counselors were henry eyring and dieter uchtdorf. they will go back to being regular members of the quorum unless they are chosen again.
salt lake city -- the mormon church appointed a 93-year-old former heart surgeon tuesday as its new president, following a longstanding succession plan that aims to keep the faith on course with a minimum of upheaval.\n\nthe selection of russell m. nelson was announced during an address broadcast from salt lake city to mormons around the world. nelson called on mormons to stay true to their faith and keep the covenant path.\n\nif you have stepped off the path, may i advise you with all the hope in my heart to please come back, nelson said. whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there's a place for you in this, the lord's church.\n\nthe announcement came after nelson was chosen as the religion's 17th president during a private meeting of the church's quorum of the twelve apostles leadership body in a temple, per church tradition that makes the longest-tenured member of the quorum the new president. nelson is now considered a prophet, seer and revelator by mormons. nelson succeeds thomas s. monson, who died jan. 2 at age 90.\n\nnelson announced that his two counselors will be dallin h. oaks, 85, and henry b. eyring, 84, both members of the quorum. eyring was also a counselor for monson, while this marks the first time oaks will serve as a counselor to a church president. oaks is the next-longest tenured member of the quorum, making him next-in-line to become the next president.\n\nmembers of the media watch as russell m. nelson speaks via television from the historic mormon salt lake temple after being announced as the 17th president of the mormon church on jan. 16, 2017, in salt lake city, utah. getty\n\nnelson is the second-oldest man to assume leadership of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, which is based in utah and counts nearly 16 million members worldwide. he will oversee the religious and business interests of the faith in collaboration with two top counselors and members of the quorum, one of the faith's top governing bodies.\n\nnelson's record during his three decades in church leadership suggests he will make few changes as he upholds church teaching and seeks to draw new members.\n\namong the challenges he faces is adapting to the increasingly global nature of the church, which was founded in 1830 in the united states and now has nearly six in 10 members living in other countries.\n\nstill, the rate of growth overall in membership has slowed in the past few decades, despite efforts to spread the faith including the lowering of the minimum age for those serving as missionaries.\n\nnelson takes the top position amid increased scrutiny of church teaching in the internet age, which has made more information on doctrine available. under monson, leaders released a series of essays explaining some controversial areas of mormon history, including early polygamous practices and a past ban on black men in the lay clergy.\n\nthe church also faces some pressure to allow greater leadership roles for women, including those who want to be admitted to the priesthood.\n\nnelson also will have to navigate the issues raised by the lgbt rights movement. the church, at times, has expressed empathy and told members to be welcoming to lgbt people while also strictly defending opposition to same-sex marriage and all homosexual relationships.\n\nlast year, mormon leaders partially cut ties with the boy scouts of america, which in 2015 ended its blanket ban on participation by openly gay adults. the lds church, which has been the biggest sponsor of troops, said the move wasn't about that decision.\n\nnelson fits the common profile of his generation of church leaders as someone who was successful in the private sector before leaving behind his career to help guide the faith.\n\nborn in salt lake city in 1924, nelson converted to mormonism at the age of 16. he was a doctor by 22. he served a two-year army medical tour of duty during the korean war before resuming a medical career that included being director of thoracic surgery residency at the university of utah.\n\nnelson learned mandarin after church president spencer w. kimball challenged church leaders in 1979 to learn the language. the next year, nelson spent a month in jinan, china, working with doctors there as a visiting professor of surgery.\n\nin the spring of 1984, he joined the quorum of the twelve apostles.\n\nthe final surgery nelson performed was the next year in china, when he operated on chinese opera star fang rongxiang at the request of a doctor who knew and trusted nelson, according to a church biography.\n\nnelson was scheduled to answer questions from reporters later tuesday morning.\n\nhis past speeches offer some clue to how he will lead.\n\nin october 2015, during a period of intense discussion about the role of women, nelson spoke of women's unique contributions.\n\nmy dear sisters, whatever your calling, whatever your circumstances, we need your impressions, your insights, and your inspiration, nelson said. married or single, you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from god. we brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence.\n\nthat year, when the u.s. legalized same-sex marriage, mormon leaders declared people in same-sex relationships apostates, meaning they could be excommunicated, and banned baptism for children living with gay parents until the children reached age 18. the policy caused an uproar among gay rights activists within and outside the church. nelson told a group of young adults in 2016 that the rules came from a revelation received by monson and other leaders that gave spiritual confirmation for their stance.\n\nlast october, in an address to the church general conference, nelson implored members to closely read and understand the faith's keystone scripture, the book of mormon.\n\nwhen i think of the book of mormon, i think of the word power, nelson said. the truths of the book of mormon have the power to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls.
democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg says he would pay more to uncle sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans. what the former new york city mayor hasn't said: he'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.\n\nbloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. that includes him: bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to forbes.\n\nmuch of that fortune is tied to bloomberg llc, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. the candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant douglas taylor. and his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.\n\nbloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. but that's not unique. all of the major democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nwhat's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. for instance, bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before president donald trump and congressional republicans lowered it in late 2017. (rivals like pete buttigieg, sanders and warren would like to roll back mr. trump's corporate tax cut completely.) that 2017 corporate-rate change saved bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.\n\nbloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates.\n\nwe don't have nor discuss mike's personal financials, a bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released.\n\nthe bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other democratic candidates have proposed, including sanders and warren as well as joe biden, pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar.\n\nbloomberg plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.\n\nhow it would work: a key in understanding bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. that means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.\n\nbloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the irs to put in place, said janet holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the urban-brookings tax policy center. but it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.\n\ncurrently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. he calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.\n\nbloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under president barack obama. that would bring the highest income tax rate under bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. that's still less than sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.\n\nhow many people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge: income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. but that might not be true for bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.\n\nroughly 11,000 americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the social security administration. include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.\n\nas of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. so the number is likely somewhere between those two.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. but that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.\n\nbased on earned income alone, bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the university of pennsylvania's penn wharton budget model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that bloomberg is proposing). about $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.\n\nsanders plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.\n\nhow it would work: sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. after that, it gets complicated.\n\nsanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.\n\nthe advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. for instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.\n\nthe disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. that wouldn't be cheap. and many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of their wealth overseas.\n\nhow many people would pay the wealth tax: the sanders wealth tax would likely affect more americans than those who would pay bloomberg's surcharge. the sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest american families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman. that's about 40,000 more households than bloomberg's wealth tax.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: the sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. penn wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.\n\nwarren plan\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.\n\nhow it would work: warren's plan, like sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. but her blueprint is simpler.\n\nthere are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. billionaires would pay 6%. that should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as bloomberg proposes.\n\nhow many people would pay: the warren campaign, as well as economists saez and zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. but another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money warren says it could.\n\nhow much government revenue it would raise: saez and zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. penn wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.\n\nbiden, buttigieg and klobuchar\n\nhow much more bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.\n\nhow their plans would work: neither joe biden, pete buttigieg nor amy klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. of the three, only klobuchar has said she is open to one. buttigieg called warren's wealth tax extreme.\n\nin fact, biden and buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.\n\ninstead, and like bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. that would hit the rich more than average americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, iras and other pre-tax retirement plans.\n\nthe candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before president trump took office. that would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.\n\nhow many people would pay more tax: the biden, buttigieg and klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all americans, not just the super wealthy.\n\nas of 2017, some 1.4 million american households had annual income of more than $500,000. nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.\n\nhow much government revenue they would raise: penn wharton has said biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. but that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. about half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to penn wharton's calculations.\n\nthe buttigieg and klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. neither campaign responded to comment for this article.\n\neditor's note: cbs moneywatch senior reporter stephen gandel is a former employee of bloomberg llc.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story said that candidate mike bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. in fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%.

sacramento, calif. - the announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts pacific gas & electric co.'s problems squarely in the hands of gov. gavin newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink california's energy picture in the face of climate change.\n\nthis issue is all about three fundamental things: it is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, newsom told reporters monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.\n\nearlier in the day, pg&e announced it will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic california wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. the announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.\n\nwe'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. i respect the taxpayer, i respect the ratepayer and i'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.\n\nthe filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. it would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. that could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.\n\nthe chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state sen. bill dodd, a napa democrat.\n\nhow much and what the state can do remains to be seen. lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened pg&e bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. democratic assemblyman chris holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on monday he said he has backed off that idea.\n\nclearly pg&e has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about pg&e's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.\n\nin a tuesday morning note, height securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for pg&e's complex problems. as of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.\n\nclimate change makes matters worse\n\n\n\npg&e serves about 40 percent of california's utility customers, newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. it operates in three-quarters of california's land most vulnerable to wildfires, newsom said. while pg&e's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending california's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.\n\nstate officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in california history, a november blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.\n\nnewsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. but no one has yet figured out the future of california energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.\n\ndemocratic sen. jerry hill said a pg&e bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. hill represents san bruno in the san francisco bay area, where a pg&e natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.\n\nthis company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. i don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.\n\nonly viable option\n\n\n\nnewsom agreed pg&e hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. he noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including chief executive geisha williams, who resigned on sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.\n\nchapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, richard kelly, chairman of pg&e's board of directors, said in a statement.\n\nthe chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential

the white house office of management and budget violated the law when it withheld military aid from ukraine, according to the government accountability office. in its decision released thursday, the federal watchdog agency concluded that the funds were frozen to align with president trump's policy priorities.\n\nfaithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that congress has enacted into law, reads the agency's decision. [the office of management and budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the impoundment control act (ica). the withholding was not a programmatic delay. therefore, we conclude that omb violated the ica.\n\nthe omb argues that the ukraine freeze was not subject to the ica because it constituted a programmatic delay, that hinged on a policy development, according to the report. the gao contends that that argument has no basis in law.\n\nprogrammatic delays occur when an agency is taking necessary steps to implement a program, but because of factors external to the program, funds temporarily go unobligated, the gao explains in its report. here, there was no external factor causing an unavoidable delay. rather, omb on its own volition explicitly barred dod from obligating amounts.\n\naccording to gao general counsel thomas h. armstrong, the white house omb told gao that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the president's foreign policy.'\n\nthe president has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the impoundment control act of 1974, armstrong said in a statement regarding its decision. ... the law does not permit omb to withhold funds for policy reasons.\n\ncounselor to the president, kellyanne conway, confronted with the gao's findings moments after they were released, said she hadn't had a chance to read the report but she was very glad that ukraine got the aid, and got it within the deadline.\n\npressed further on the report's findings, conway emphasized that ukraine did receive the aid, and mr. trump wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than aid was under his predecessor.\n\nwell then it's a good thing that the aid that congress approved got to ukraine intact and it got there because this president released it, conway said. and he wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than it was under president obama so that they can protect themselves against foreign aggression.\n\nthe gao — an independent watchdog that provides information and legal analysis to congress on executive activity — concluded that the white house omb was unauthorized to withhold the approximately $214 million in military aid from ukraine in summer 2019. congress had already appropriated $250 million to the department of defense for security assistance to ukraine for fiscal year 2019.\n\nthe funds were intended to provide ukraine with training; equipment; lethal assistance; logistics support, supplies and services; sustainment; and intelligence support as they defend themselves against their neighbor, and aggressor, russia.\n\naccording to gao's report, the omb withheld the funds by making the money unavailable for obligation, effectively pausing its availability to the dod.\n\ngao also reported that that the omb and the state department did not provide them with all the documentation requested in their investigation. specifically, gao notes that the agencies provided them with very little information on foreign military financing over a period of six days in august 2019.\n\nwe consider a reluctance to provide a fulsome response to have constitutional significance, reads the gao's decision. ... all federal officials and employees take an oath to uphold and protect the constitution and its core tenets, including the congressional power of the purse.\n\nthe gao said it will renew its request for information from the state department and omb. we will continue to pursue this matter.\n\n— kathryn watson contributed to this report
arizona and uber kept the company's testing of self-driving cars in the state out of the spotlight for months, according to a report in the guardian.\n\nthat is, until a self-driving car in arizona crashed into a woman crossing the road in a phoenix suburb and killed her, and arizona gov. doug ducey suspended the testing of autonomous vehicles in his state.\n\nneither uber, nor the state of arizona had a legal obligation to inform the public about the testing, under arizona law. and ducey did sign an executive order in august 2015 allowing the testing of autonomous vehicles in the state.\n\nbut emails obtained by the guardian under public records laws show reveal a consistent working relationship between uber and ducey's office.\n\nuber representatives and ducey first met a month after ducey was sworn into office in 2015, according to the guardian. in april 2015, ducey signed legislation authorizing ride-sharing in the state in a high-profile appearance.\n\na few months later, ducey had a press conference with uber announcing the company's $25,000 gift to the university of arizona's college of optical sciences. uber claimed it would base a fleet of cars out of the university. the same day, aug. 25, 2015, ducey issued an executive order allowing for the testing of autonomous cars with human drivers in the car as a safety precaution.\n\nin july 2016, uber's communications director taylor patterson asked ducey's office to tweet about uber eats' arrival in his state. ducey did so the following day.\n\njust before uber began testing the autonomous cars in august 2016, uber's head of public policy, ashwini chabra, informed ducey's deputy chief of staff that the testing was about to begin, and asked him to send someone discreet to give the phoenix police department a heads up, according to the emails the guardian obtained.\n\nducey's office said it is categorically false that uber's testing was a secret. ptak pointed to multiple news stories from 2016 about such autonomous vehicle testing in arizona.\n\nthe allegation that any company began testing autonomous vehicle technology in arizona 'in secret' is categorically false, patrick ptak, spokesman for ducey's office, told cbs news.  ... arizona has been very public about the testing and operation of self-driving cars -- it has been anything but a secret. the governor has also demonstrated he will hold companies accountable when necessary, as his letter to uber this week indicates.\n\nuber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

do you know?\n\nwanda abel: carolyn … was trying to decide whether she would be happy being married and staying in japan.\n\nwhile contemplating a future life with ayagaki, carolyn received an offer for another job 330 miles away and across the sea of japan.\n\nin the fall of 1988, carolyn set out on her next adventure in life, teaching english in seoul, south korea.\n\ncarolyn abel wanda abel\n\nnancy bercaw: and from the minute she walked into the staff room, she was just a breath of fresh air. …she sort of looked a little bit like farrah fawcett.\n\nthat's where carolyn quickly fell in with nancy bercaw and the other american teachers at school. like sandra ames, who requested that we alter her current appearance for this interview.\n\nsandra ames: she was making her students laugh, and sing, and -- and have fun learning english.\n\nand tamara doak.\n\ntamara doak: she made friends with everybody. she was very, very friendly.\n\ncarolyn also hit it off with the head teacher at the school, kathy patrick.\n\nsandra ames: carolyn and kathy patrick were extremely good friends. …they were considered, if i can use a modern term, besties.\n\nthe women taught, traveled and partied together.\n\nnancy bercaw: ex-pat life in seoul in the late '80s was wild and … one place where our worlds collided and that was itaewon, the red-light district. … so, what we did is we danced and drank like crazy people.\n\non the weekend of dec. 17, 1988, just three days before the murder, ames, patrick, carolyn and some korean students took a trip into the mountains. carolyn took pictures.\n\nsandra ames: we spent the time looking at temples, and hiking and then partying in the evenings.\n\nclasses were winding down for the winter break. ayagaki was getting ready to fly to seoul, hoping to get an answer to his marriage proposal. on tuesday, dec. 20, carolyn never made it to work.\n\nnancy bercaw: and a lot of us … missed work on occasion for various reasons.\n\nsandra ames: i was not at that point concerned. but … kathy was concerned about carolyn because she couldn't get her on the phone.\n\nkathy patrick was the head teacher at the english language school in seoul when carolyn abel arrived to teach there wanda abel\n\nnancy bercaw: kathy was asking all of us -- had any of us heard from carolyn. … no.\n\nsandra ames: kathy was very upset, convinced that something had happened to carolyn.\n\ntamara doak: and -- i said, well … maybe we should go over there.\n\nsandra aes: at that point, some of our students drove us to carolyn's apartment. we went into the apartment, and kathy … discovered the body … she was murdered brutally and horribly and in a way she did not deserve.\n\ntamara doak: and we were just all in shock. … just trying to figure out … what happened.\n\nnancy bercaw: i think we all just felt like, what the hell's gonna happen now? are we in danger? how will sandra and kathy ever recover from the shock of seeing their dead friend? where do we go from here?\n\nwhat happened in carolyn's apartment?\n\npeter van sant [outside carolyn's apartment building]: carolyn's apartment was on the 15th floor. so here we are. peter van sant [ knocks on door, speaks to man in carolyn's old apartment]: i'm peter van sant. and i'm a reporter for cbs news and we are working on a story about a woman named carolyn who used to live in your apartment. … and we came by to ask you … if we may have permission … to come into your apartment to take some video pictures.\n\nearly in the afternoon on dec. 20, 1988, colleagues and students of carolyn abel's came to her apartment building after she failed to show up for work.\n\nkathy patrick, sandra ames and three korean men walked down the outdoor hallway. surprisingly, the door was unlocked and they went inside.\n\npeter van sant: who was the first person into the apartment?\n\nsandra ames: kathy … she went -- did a b-line right to the bedroom. … kathy came out of the room and said, carolyn's dead. we need to call an ambulance. no, we need to call the cops. and she didn't want me to go look at the body.\n\ncarolyn abel put up a fight in her last minutes of life. she had a number of defensive wounds. and she took the brunt of it. more than 30 stab wounds including a cut -- from ear to ear on the-- on the throat. and there was blood everywhere in here. on the walls, on the bed. it was a mess.\n\nkorean police and press swarmed carolyn's apartment, which had been ransacked. u.s. army cid\n\nkorean police and press swarmed the apartment, which had been ransacked. within hours, the murder led the national news in south korea.\n\ntamara doak: and i remember watching the news and the cameras panning around the room. and they kept, you know, going in on this teddy bear … and it was really horrible.\n\nnancy bercaw: the impact of seeing her body wheeled out in a body bag really made it quite real … it wasn't a dream. it became the nightmare that it really still is to this day.\n\npeter van sant: how did you get the news of what had happened to your sister?\n\nwanda abel: i was at home. … and my mother called me … she told me that carolyn had been murdered. and i just -- i screamed … we're just -- crying … trying to figure out, i mean, how could this happen? who would wanna do this to her? everybody loved carolyn. why?\n\nwith the killer still out there, carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?\n\nnancy bercaw: we were all certain that … perhaps a korean … had probably killed her. … if a korean hated an american this much, was he coming after the rest of us?\n\nthe shocked friends turned their attention to kathy patrick and sandra ames, who had discovered carolyn's body.\n\ntamara doak: they seemed horrified. … i was so concerned about them.\n\nnancy bercaw: they were hysterical. … it seemed as if they were having a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\ndays later, patrick led a memorial service for carolyn.\n\nnancy bercaw [emotional]: and i think it was quite moving.\n\npeter van sant: even now thinking about it, you tear up a bit.\n\npatrick also wrote to carolyn's parents. wanda abel still has that letter.\n\nwanda abel [reading]: please know that i loved carolyn as a sister and a dear friend. … my roommate and are i the two people who found carolyn in her apartment. let me know if i can tell you anything.\n\nin japan, tomoyuki ayagaki learned the love of his life with was gone. but he decided to make his trip to south korea anyway. he stayed with patrick and ames.\n\npeter van sant: even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?\n\ntomoyuki ayagaki: yeah [wipes away a tear]. sorry.\n\nin seoul, rumors were swirling and south korean police cast a wide net.\n\nnancy bercaw: we were all suspects. … every single teacher on the staff was interviewed. … and, you know, the korean police were in our faces just like, where were you? how did you know carolyn? what's your story? why are you here? why did you come into our country? are you secretly fbi? … we just kept thinking, why are you asking me this? get out there and find the real killer.\n\nthen, bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.\n\nnancy bercaw: it sounded like a korean woman. … and then very quickly, she said, i know who killed carolyn. i said, what? … she said, an american military officer.\n\nbercaw told the south korean police, who brought in detectives from the u.s. army.\n\nnancy bercaw: and very quickly thereafter john boatwright walked in.\n\njohn boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the army's criminal investigation division in south korea. he quickly eliminated the u.s. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend.\n\njohn boatwright: he did not know carolyn abel. … and it appeared that she was just trying to get revenge on him for the bad breakup.\n\nthree weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. the report also confirmed her throat was cut.\n\njohn boatwright: in my opinion, her throat was cut after she was deceased.\n\npeter van sant: after? how unusual is that based on your experience?\n\njohn boatwright: very unusual.\n\njohn boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the army's criminal investigation division in south korea. he quickly eliminated the u.s. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend. john boatwright\n\nso, what did happen at carolyn's apartment?\n\njohn boatwright: i was convinced that … whoever did this probably knew carolyn.\n\npeter van sant: why?\n\njohn boatwright: because there was no signs of forced entry into the apartment. … it appeared that whoever was in that apartment knew her.\n\npeter van sant: there were two coffee cups found in the room. … if there's a break-in, generally, a criminal would not say, hey, let's -- let's have a cup of coffee before i ransack your place and attack you.\n\njohn boatwright: that certainly would not be normal.\n\nlike his south korean counterparts, boatwright decided to question carolyn's colleagues, who told him:\n\njohn boatwright: you really should look at the two girls who found the body.\n\nthose two women? sandra ames and kathy patrick.\n\nnancy bercaw: we assumed that a korean had probably killed her. …but little did we know that the enemy was inside that staff room with us.\n\na suspect comes into focus\n\njust weeks after carolyn abel's murder, the investigation by john boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates kathy patrick and sandra ames.\n\npeter van sant: and do you get a chance to question each of them?\n\njohn boatwright: no. kathy patrick had already gotten on a plane and left korea.\n\nnancy bercaw: we had encouraged her to go. she must have lost 15 pounds … she just looked like someone who was about to break.\n\nkathy patrick, left, and sandra ames\n\npatrick returned home to washington state, but ames was still in seoul.\n\njohn boatwright: i took a statement from her … and then, i ask her, did you kill carolyn? and … she just, sort of, sat there and stared at me.\n\npeter van sant: she's just staring at you?\n\njohn boatwright: that's correct. … after about 30 seconds, she was very quiet, but she said, no. … that was just -- just not normal.\n\names maintains she had nothing to hide. so, two months after the murder, she waived her right to an attorney and agreed to take a lie detector test.\n\nsandra ames: i remember … being hooked up to all the wires in a darkened room.\n\njohn boatwright: he asked her, do you know where the murder weapon is? and she said, no. and she really peaked out on that … indicating … she was not being truthful.\n\nsandra ames: i said, i'm not lying. i'm telling the truth. … so we took it again with the same results. and at that point i said, let me tell you about this picture in my head. … the picture was a dark shape on a bed covered in a quilt that i knew was a body.\n\names described that picture in her head as a fragmented memory of that night. as boatwright asked her for more details, she told a new story. it was nothing short of a bombshell.\n\nsandra ames: the story began with being in bed, and having kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, i think i killed carolyn. what with? i asked. and she said, a knife. where is it? i asked. in the kitchen sink.\n\names said she was in disbelief, and asked patrick to take her to carolyn's apartment where she saw her friend's brutalized body on the bed, covered in blood.\n\nsandra ames: to the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.\n\nthough she didn't mention it when we spoke with her, boatwright says that during their interview, sandra made another statement about her own actions that night after she walked in and saw carolyn's body.\n\njohn boatwright: she says, i touched her arm and it was warm. and at that point, i realized that she may be still alive and that she might testify against … kathy. and so i went to the kitchen, got a knife, and came back, and i cut her throat to make sure she was dead.\n\nremember, boatwright believed that wound was inflicted after carolyn was already dead from the stab wound to the lung.\n\npeter van sant: so what sandra is telling you is actually forensically matching up w -- what was done to carolyn's body?\n\njohn boatwright: absolutely.\n\nbut sandra ames' story quickly changed. in official statements, ames wrote that kathy patrick had admitted to cutting carolyn's throat. and today ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. but she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.\n\npeter van sant: you did tell authorities at the time that you cleaned a bloody knife.\n\nsandra ames: i did. i did, and that was because -- i remembered putting the clean knife into the dish rack … kathy had said that that was the knife she had used to kill carolyn.\n\nit may seem far-fetched, but ames claims those memories had been suppressed deep in her subconscious mind until the interview with boatwright.\n\npeter van sant: are you telling me the truth?\n\nsandra ames: yes. yes.\n\npeter van sant: because some of these lapses in memory are kind of convenient.\n\nsandra ames: oh, they're very convenient. … but no, this is the truth as i lived it.\n\nthough ames' story was bizarre to say the least, investigators believed the core details, which never changed: that patrick woke her up and confessed to killing carolyn, and the two of them staged it to look like a robbery. and the evidence they collected, appeared to back that up.\n\njohn boatwright: each time that she was interviewed later, she kept changing the facts to -- to limit her involvement in the murder. but she never denied that kathy did the murder. and she never denied that she was present just after the murder.\n\npeter van sant: who do you believe held the knife and murdered carolyn abel?\n\njohn boatwright: kathy patrick.\n\nafter her confession, sandra ames was kept in house arrest in seoul. five months later, in july 1989, she pleaded guilty to harboring a criminal and suppressing evidence.\n\nsandra ames: i was fingerprinted, photographed and put into a holding cell.\n\nbut why would patrick want carolyn dead? investigators uncovered a secret which provided a potential motive.\n\ntamara doak: kathy really fell for carolyn.\n\ntamara doak was one of the few teachers who knew kathy was gay.\n\ntamara doak: and she would confide in me, you know, i really like this woman. … i think she's into me. and i'm like, kathy, i don't really think she's gay. you should really be careful.\n\nsandra ames: kathy told me that she was in love with carolyn … and that … her feelings were not necessarily returned.\n\njohn boatwright: i believe that -- kathy and carolyn were alone -- during that initial attack. … the thing that makes the most sense to me is … kathy tried to kiss carolyn and carolyn pushed her away and rejected that kiss. … i think kathy was so enraged and angry that she lost control.\n\nkathy patrick was now the prime suspect in carolyn abel's murder. a murder warrant for her arrest was issued in south korea. back in japan, carolyn's boyfriend, tomoyuki ayagaki, heard the news.\n\npeter van sant: you stayed with kathy at her apartment.\n\ntomoyuki ayagaki: apart-- yes. … [via interpreter] it was a huge shock … if that's true, if i stayed in the home of the -- of the murderer, i -- i feel terrible.\n\nkathy patrick was now the prime suspect in carolyn abel's murder. tamara doak\n\nfor her part in the alleged crimes, sandra ames was sentenced to one year in prison. meanwhile, kathy patrick was back at home in washington state. the south korean government made diplomatic requests to return her to seoul from the u.s. to face a murder charge, but hit a wall.\n\njohn boatwright: there was no extradition treaty with korea at the time.\n\ntamara doak: once she left … they couldn't get her back there.\n\nnancy bercaw: why couldn't we see through kathy and sandra? it's just – unreal. you know, in one fell swoop, you learn that your friends are involved in this crime … and that the one who might have been the killer is free. … because of this loophole in american law.\n\nin the states, carolyn's family pushed for an arrest.\n\nwanda abel: the u.s. attorney in washington state said, no, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the united states. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … and that's what pushed my family to say, wait a minute. this isn't right.\n\nbut american authorities weren't finished with kathy patrick. and soon, they would come face-to-face with her.\n\npeter van sant: did you ask kathy patrick flat-out, did you murder carolyn abel?\n\nsteven schroeder: yes, i did.\n\na family's fight for justice\n\nin the days after carolyn's murder, wanda abel worked overtime during the holidays to bring her home.\n\nwanda abel: we got her back in time to hold the funeral on new year's eve.\n\ngone but never forgotten. wanda abel and her family were pushing the government to pursue a case against kathy patrick, who had left south korea just weeks after carolyn's murder.\n\nwanda abel holds one of the last pictures taken of her sister, carolyn. cbs news/wanda abel\n\npeter van sant: so, do you believe this sudden move from south korea to the united states was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?\n\nwanda abel: yes. … kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … so she spends as little time in south korea as possible after she killed carolyn.\n\nwith kathy patrick back in washington state, carolyn abel's family was fearful they could be targeted.\n\nwanda abel: i was worried that kathy would try to kill us, because kathy wrote these letters to my parents that she was her great friend and that … she'd love to meet them. … and i was working through my mind, what would i do if i saw this person or if she showed up at my house?\n\ndespite the lack of an extradition treaty, there was still that south korean arrest warrant for murder for kathy patrick. they also asked the u.s. government for help.\n\nsteven schroeder: my name is steven schroeder, i'm a retired assistant united states attorney and i worked in seattle.\n\npeter van sant: what did the south koreans want you to do?\n\nsteven schroeder: among other things, they wanted me to take a deposition of kathy patrick and ask her some questions about the murder that occurred in seoul.\n\nit was 1989 when steven schroeder was assigned the case with john boatwright and fbi agents. along with her lawyer, kathy patrick willingly sat down with them to be questioned.\n\npeter van sant: did you ask kathy patrick flat-out, did you murder carolyn abel?\n\nsteven schroeder: yes, i did.\n\npeter van sant: what did she say?\n\nsteven schroeder: she said she did not.\n\npeter van sant: and did you present her with what her roommate had said?\n\nsteven schroeder: yes.\n\npeter van sant: and what did she say about that?\n\nsteven schroeder: simply, it wasn't true.\n\npeter van sant: and did kathy try to shift blame at all? did she point the finger of suspicion at all at sandra?\n\nsteven schroeder: not with me.\n\npatrick also denied, under oath, that she was in love with carolyn abel.\n\npeter van sant: do you believe kathy patrick lied to you?\n\nsteven schroeder: there was enough indication of that to justify us doing further investigation, yes. … my strategy at that point was if the koreans did not prosecute her, then to look whether we could for basically false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice.\n\neven though lie detector tests are inadmissible in federal court, they are a tool used by investigators to confirm deception. kathy patrick willingly agreed to take one and answer questions about carolyn's murder.\n\nsteven schroeder: the examiner concluded that she was deceptive.\n\npeter van sant: and deception is –\n\nsteven schroeder: lying.\n\npeter van sant: lying.\n\nafter the polygraph, kathy patrick -- whom south korea still wanted to arrest for murder -- was free to leave and resume her life in washington state.\n\npeter van sant: is that frustrating?\n\nsteven schroeder: it was very frustrating.\n\ncompounding carolyn's family's grief, sandra ames was released from a south korean prison after serving just six months of her one-year sentence -- and it wasn't because of good behavior.\n\npeter van sant: is it true you got out of prison because someone bribed a judge to get you out?\n\nsandra ames: yep. absolutely.\n\nwanda abel: we just couldn't believe it. i mean, six months for assisting a murderer and covering up the crime scene and making it look like a burglary and not even telling anybody? not talking? … i don't understand.\n\nwhen ames returned to the united states, she was recruited by the fbi to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with kathy patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.\n\nsandra ames: i didn't even call. i simply went to her house.\n\npeter van sant: and what did she say to you? … sandra, what are you doing here?\n\nsandra ames: probably [laughs]. … and i think i said something along the lines of, how could you have done that? how could you have killed carolyn? … and she said, i don't know what you're talking about.\n\nwithout incriminating statements from patrick, the feds were not able to press charges for perjury.\n\npeter van sant: as long as she stays within these borders, she's a free woman.\n\nsteven schroeder: that's -- that's correct, yes.\n\nand with no extradition treaty in place, south korean authorities put the murder case on the shelf.\n\nwanda abel: i think the south koreans were taking the attitude that this is a u.s. problem. it's two u.s. citizens.\n\nmeanwhile, carolyn's family carried on with their quest for justice.\n\nwanda abel: my dad … contacting every congressman, every senator … he wrote to news stations – 60 minutes … 'cause he was hoping that if that happened, then there would be more publicity, more pressure.\n\nwhile kathy patrick carried on with her life.\n\npeter van sant if it is true that kathy patrick murdered your sister, is she a danger today to the public?\n\nwanda abel: i think she probably is. … and who knows what would trigger some kind -- that kind of violence again?\n\nprime suspect speaks\n\nfor almost three decades, kathy patrick has a lived a quiet life in bellingham, washington, located north of seattle, where for the last 18 years, she has worked as a student advisor at western washington university.\n\npatrick turned down 48 hours' request for an interview, saying carolyn's murder was too painful to talk about. but on this day, her past was fast approaching.\n\npeter van sant [walking outside]: we're gonna make our move now to kathy patrick's office.\n\npeter van sant: hi, kathy patrick?\n\nkathy patrick: hi.\n\npeter van sant: hi. peter van sant, with cbs news. … there are investigators from two countries that … are certain that you murdered carolyn abel, what do you have to say?\n\nkathy patrick: umm, i have to say that i'm innocent. and that i -- don't know what happened after i found carolyn's body.\n\nkathy patrick and 48 hours correspondent peter van sant cbs news\n\nthese are kathy patrick's first public words on the murder of carolyn abel in 30 years.\n\npeter van sant: now your roommate says just the opposite. that you confessed to her, and that the two of you then went back over to carolyn's apartment and staged the scene as a burglary.\n\nkathy patrick: no.\n\npeter van sant: that never happened?\n\nkathy patrick: no.\n\npeter van sant: so she is lying to us when she told us that?\n\nkathy patrick: i believe she is.\n\npeter van sant: you flunked a polygraph test … how did that happen?\n\nkathy patrick: i don't know the science of polygraphs, i'm not surprised that i would, um, flunk it in retrospect given how clammy and nervous i am right now and i am even shaking. it was a frightening experience and i absolutely do not know what happened before i went to her apartment and found her body. please sit.\n\npeter van sant: it has been 30 years since this –\n\npeter van sant: isn't it time to come clean about this? investigators are certain that you committed this murder\n\nkathy patrick: they are wrong.\n\npeter van sant: if you didn't who did?\n\nkathy patrick: i believe it must have been … ames.\n\npeter van sant: sandra ames? … she says you did it, and you had her go over and help manipulate the room to make it look like a burglary.\n\nkathy patrick: that's not true.\n\npeter van sant: another circumstance in all of this is that –\n\nkathy patrick: um, can we stop right now?\n\npeter van sant: these are important questions to be asked about this. there were 30 stab wounds on carolyn's body and friends say that you attacked her after she rejected you –\n\nkathy patrick [emphatic]: no.\n\npeter van sant: -- your romantic advances.\n\nkathy patrick: no! this has to stop now, please. … you're really sidelining me here, and i am not prepared to answer questions here at my place of work. this happened 30 years ago, i have been available to investigators in korea and in the u.s.\n\nin her interviews with south korean police, a deposition and a polygraph test with american investigators, kathy patrick did not point a finger at sandra ames. steven schroeder had a question about that for patrick.\n\nsteven schroeder: well, why didn't you tell us that 29 years ago?\n\nwhen 48 hours recently contacted sandra ames, she told us she wasn't surprised that kathy patrick tried to blame her and denied having participated in carolyn's murder.\n\nsandra ames: if it went to trial, i would be willing to testify. i would need to testify.\n\npeter van sant: where should kathy patrick be today, in your opinion?\n\nwanda abel: she should be in prison. plain and simple.\n\nthanks to the abel family's lobbying efforts, in 1994 congress passed a law that allows for the u.s. prosecution of u.s. nationals who kill other americans in foreign countries.\n\nsteven schroeder: and so, today, american families -- if their loved ones are murdered abroad by an american -- will have a very different experience than carolyn abel's family did. and i think -- i think we all owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nbut in carolyn abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. in south korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. and the abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the united states.\n\nwanda abel: no one should have to go through what my family went through. how … do we live in a world … where a u.s. citizen and go and murder a u.s. citizen, and then come back and live like nothing happened? that's the outrage of this.\n\nin a case where nothing is simple, the long path to justice may never reach its destination.\n\nwanda abel: i honestly can't picture her old 'cause she was just always so -- so vibrant and so energetic. and i -- i -- i think she still would be. … you know, i miss her. she was like my best friend.\n\nnancy bercaw: we've all continued our lives as adventurous people. …but, you know, we kind of … carry the memory of carolyn … behind us, whatever ground we walk on. it's hard not to remember there's another one of us who could be out there on the same path.\n\nthe law that carolyn abel's family helped pass has led to three successful murder prosecutions.
marc anthony is one of the music world's biggest stars, but he regrets the time chasing his career took away from being a father, he tells tracy smith in an interview for cbs' sunday morning.\n\nthe one regret would be that what i chose to do took so much of my time. what i would have done to have been a stay-at-home dad, and, you know, witnessed every second of everything, anthony told smith, in an interview to be broadcast on may 1. i would have loved that. didn't work out that way. so it's the one thing that just tugs at me ... that's the biggest sacrifice. and you sort of start to wonder, was it all worth it? was it worth it?\n\nin a wide-ranging interview, the grammy-winner talks about his childhood growing up one of eight kids in new york city's spanish harlem. anthony dreamed of getting out of the neighborhood, but to do so, he says, he had to change who he was.\n\nto my mom, i was a pain in the ass. to my dad, i was the light of his eyes. and to me, i was awkward, he said. i had glasses. i weighed two pounds. my dad always told me, and as god's honest truth, 'son, we're ugly. work on your personality.'\n\nhe says it was the best thing his father ever told him.\n\nit worked. anthony has sold more than 12 million albums worldwide, has a line of clothing at kohl's, owns a piece of the miami dolphins, and has recently launched his own company, magnus media, to help fellow musicians and athletes target the $1.5 trillion that latinos spend each year.\n\nthis started as a dream and it became a reality, anthony says of the business.\n\nanthony also talks in the interview about his former marriage to jennifer lopez, and his decision to speak out against donald trump during a performance at madison square garden.\n\nthe emmy award-winning sunday morning with charles osgood is broadcast on cbs on sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. et. executive producer is rand morrison.\n\nfollow the program on twitter (@cbssunday), facebook, instagram (#cbssundaymorning) and at cbssundaymorning.com. you can also listen to sunday morning audio podcasts at play.it.\n\n\n\nfor more info:
montgomery, ala. -- alabama chief justice roy moore's defiance of federal court rulings on same-sex marriage violated judicial ethics, a disciplinary court ruled on friday before suspending him for the rest of his term.\n\nthe punishment effectively removes moore from office without the nine-member alabama court of the judiciary officially ousting him. given his age, he will not be able to run for chief justice again under state law.\n\nmoore was found to have encouraged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples six months after the u.s. supreme court ruled that everyone has a fundamental right to marry in all 50 states.\n\nmoore vehemently denied that his administrative order was an act of defiance and said his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it.\n\nthe same panel removed the outspoken republican in 2003 because he refused to remove a ten commandments monument from the state judicial building. voters later re-elected him as chief justice after he lost a race for governor.\n\nthis time, moore sent an administrative order to the state's 68 probate judges, maintaining that the alabama supreme court's same-sex marriage ban remained in full force and effect despite the ruling from the nation's highest court.\n\nmoore testified that his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it, and that his january order merely provided judges with a status report on a technical aspect of the law.\n\nmoore, 69, had already been suspended from the bench since may, when the state's judicial inquiry commission accused him of violating judicial ethics. by the end of his term in 2019, he'll be beyond the age limit of 70 for judges, unless voters raise the limit in november.\n\nwe are here 13 years later because the chief justice learned nothing from his first removal. he continues to defy the law, john carroll, a lawyer representing the commission, argued wednesday in moore's judicial court hearing.\n\nmoore was loudly applauded when he entered the ornate chamber where he usually presides over the state supreme court. he told his inquisitors that the ethics charges were ridiculous.\n\ni gave them a status in the case, a status of the facts that these orders exist. that is all i did, moore testified.\n\nmoore's ethics trial came amid upheaval in all three branches of alabama's government. the republican speaker of the state house of representatives was removed from office this summer for criminal ethics violations. a legislative committee is weighing whether gov. robert bentley should be impeached over a scandal involving a top aide.
jesse tyler ferguson is going to start a modern family of his own. the actor announced on the late late show with james corden that he and husband justin mikita are expecting their first child together.\n\nthe reveal came after host james corden mentioned fellow guest charlie hunnam is hitting a milestone — his 40th birthday. ferguson, who is 44, chimed in to say turning 40 is when you finally become an adult... like 'i need to start getting serious about things.'\n\nactually, this is something i haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. i'm actually expecting a baby in july with my husband. the crowd erupted with cheers and ferguson joked, let's just keep it between us.\n\nhe didn't reveal if he and mikita are having a boy or girl, just saying that they're having a human.\n\nactor jesse tyler ferguson, left, and his husband justin mikita arrive for the 2019 mtv video music awards in newark, new jersey on august 26, 2019. johannes eisele/afp via getty images\n\non modern family, the actor plays michell pritchett, an uptight lawyer who married his longtime partner, cameron, and adopted a baby girl named lily. the sitcom chronicles their journey to fatherhood and raising their daughter.\n\nit appears life imitates art. in real life, ferguson is married to a lawyer and now they're about to become dads. the pair wed in 2013.\n\nmikita is also an activist. he and ferguson started the nonprofit organization tie the knot, which raises money and awareness for same-sex marriage and lgbtq rights while also providing stylish bowties and other accessories for couples to wear during their nuptials.\n\nthe goal of tie the knot is clear: to advocate for lgbtq civil rights throughout the united states & beyond, and to look damn good while doing it, the organization's website reads.\n\non the late late show, ferguson didn't reveal many details about his and mikita's future bundle of joy, but he did open up about the end of modern family.\n\nit's incredibly sad. it's something i've been doing for 11 years — that's like first through eleventh grade as a kid. that's a lifetime, he said about the show's upcoming ending. we'll never have a job this good.\n\ni'm big with an 'irish exit.' i do not like long goodbyes, so maybe that's what i'll do. after my last scene i'll just leave the lot and just drive home, he said, receiving laughs from the audience. i think that's the only way i'll be able to manage this. it's really emotional.\n\ncorden put things in perspective for ferguson: on your last day of 'modern family,' knowing what we know now, you should think i'm leaving 'modern family' behind, but come july, you're going to make your new modern family — and it's going to be beautiful.
franklin graham, who is the son of the late evangelist billy graham and a prominent supporter of president trump, slammed democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg for being gay, christian and married. in a series of three tweets wednesday, he assailed buttigieg for remarks he has made about being a gay christian.\n\npresidential candidate & south bend mayor @petebuttigieg is right—god doesn't have a political party, graham wrote. but god does have commandments, laws & standards he gives us to live by. god doesn't change. his word is the same yesterday, today & forever.\n\nthen, graham added, mayor buttigieg says he's a gay christian. as a christian i believe the bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. the bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\n\ngraham, who heads the billy graham evangelistic association and the christian relief group samaritan's purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on buttigieg, in light of his support of mr. trump. msnbc's joe scarborough exclaimed, oh shut up. you are a disgrace, adding, you are a disgrace for normalizing donald trump's behavior.\n\ngraham has said of mr. trump, i never said he was the best example of the christian faith. he defends the faith. and i appreciate that very much. and he said that the president has admitted his faults and has apologized to his wife and daughter for things he has done and said. and he has to stand before god for those things.\n\nbuttigieg has been feuding with vice president mike pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, buttigieg said at an lgbtq victory fund brunch earlier this month. and that's the thing i wish the mike pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who i am, your problem is not with me. your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nhe has also suggested that suffers from his own christian failings in supporting mr. trump. how could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in donald trump? he said at a cnn town hall in march.\n\nin 2015, when both buttigieg and pence were serving in indiana, pence, then the governor, signed a law that critics said unfairly targeted members of the lgbtq community. months later, during his mayoral re-election bid, buttigieg came out as gay. the law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.\n\nlast year, buttigieg married teacher chasten glezman, and should he win the presidency, the two would be the first gay first couple in the white house.\n\nbuttigieg has not yet responded to graham's remarks.
linda ronstadt quit performing years ago – her parkinson's disease makes singing impossible. but last fall, she spoke to a sellout crowd at the theatre at ace hotel in los angeles, who came to see her in person, and listen to her talk about what has been a magical life.\n\nthe great thing about having a hit is that means people like you, ronstadt told the audience.\n\nbut the bad thing about it is, it means you have to sing that song over and over and over again, night after and night after night, 'til it starts sounding like your washing machine.\n\nlinda ronstadt, with john boylan, appeared on stage at a conversation with linda ronstadt in los angles last october. cbs news\n\nthe crowd basked in ronstadt's tales of her life and career, such as when she toured for four months as the opening act of the doors: it was pretty tough to play with the doors. it was kinda like a double bill of 'bambi' and 'deep throat'!\n\ncorrespondent tracy smith asked ronstadt, what's it like to get that kind of warmth when you're just talking?\n\ni was just astounded. i mean, it made me feel good, but i was glad they didn't boo, or start yelling for 'heat wave'!\n\nand you know she's heard that before.\n\nin case you need a reminder, ronstadt was a musical force of nature who sold 100 million records, had four consecutive platinum albums, and won an armful of grammys for songs in wildly different music styles, like country, latin and pop.\n\nfor much of her career, she practically lived on the road. but these days, her world is a bit smaller:\n\nshe mostly keeps to a san francisco neighborhood close to the famous bridge, and a house on a quiet street where it seems she has now become the world's most famous couch potato.\n\nthese days she spends much of her time reading. i can't do a lot of things that are active, she said. i can't spend very much time on my feet, or even very much time sitting up. i have to kind of lounge around. but i'm lazy, so it's a good thing that i lounge!\n\nso, i'm glad to have the leisure time. i have a huge stack of books that i need to read.\n\nsmith asked, when you think about those songs, in your mind, can you still sing?\n\noh, i can sing in my brain; i sing in my brain all the time. but it's not quite the same as doing it physically. you know, there's a physical feeling in singing that's just like skiing down a hill, except better, 'cause i'm not a very good skier!\n\nbut she was a very good singer:\n\nfor more than four decades it seemed there was nothing linda ronstadt couldn't do, until she sensed that her voice was beginning to fail her.\n\nsmith asked, when did you start noticing there was something wrong with your voice?\n\n2000, she replied. i'd start to sing and then it would just clamp up. it was, like, a cramp. my voice would freeze. and i said, 'there's something wrong with my voice.' and people would say, 'oh, you're just a perfectionist.' i go, 'no, there's really something systemically wrong.'\n\nand it's very slow-moving, this disease, so it took a long time to really finally manifest.\n\nshe played her last show in 2009, but it wasn't until 2013 that she revealed she'd been diagnosed with parkinson's.\n\nshe'd retired before she knew what was happening: oh yeah. i was just yelling. instead of singing, i was just kind of yelling. i didn't want to charge people for that.\n\ndo you think other people heard it, too, really? asked smith.\n\nyeah, yeah. but i mean, it wouldn't have mattered. i could hear it. it wasn't any fun anymore. you know, singing is … there are really a lot of things you can do with your voice; you can slide on all different sorts of textures and things. and if you're not doing that, it's not interesting.\n\nand she always tried to keep it interesting. besides her solo work, she teamed up with some of the greatest voices in the business.\n\nto watch linda ronstadt perform with dolly parton and emmylou harris on the late show with david letterman, click on the video player below:\n\nno record company wanted to touch that, ronstadt said. called us the 'queenston trio.'\n\nit's an amazing thing, when you sing with somebody. it's a very intimate relationship. it's almost like sex. it's as intimate as sex, but it's not sex. it's different. it's that intimate. it's like a great love affair.\n\nher own love affair with music started when she was a kid growing up in arizona in a musical family, learning to sing and play the guitar.\n\nshe was, and is, an independent spirit, from her career choices to her relationships, like her much-publicized romance with former california governor jerry brown.\n\nshe says she still talks with brown. yeah, he was here for thanksgiving.\n\nit seems like you've managed to maintain relationships with people who were in your life, smith said.\n\ni don't know why they're still speaking to me, but they are!\n\nwhy didn't you ever get married?\n\ni was not cut out for marriage, ronstadt replied. i used to dream that i was gonna get married, and i'd go, 'i'm too young to get married.' and this was when i was, like, 45, you know? and i'd go, 'i can't get married. i'm too young.' so i guess that means i'm just really immature! i'm not good at compromising.\n\nyou know this about yourself?\n\noh boy, do i ever!\n\nthe stone poneys, featuring linda ronstadt, performs different drum:\n\nbut her refusal to compromise helped her reach the heights of artistic achievement, and take home countless awards, including the national medal of arts in 2014, presented by an admittedly smitten president.\n\nsmith said, president obama confessed, or admitted, to having a crush on you.\n\noh, he was being nice to a 70-year-old woman in a wheelchair, ronstadt said.\n\nhow about that medal? do accolades like that mean something to you?\n\nwell, it's kinda big! i didn't know what to do with that. i put it under the bed. it's under my bed, with my crowbar that i have for in case there's an earthquake and i have to pry the roof off myself. i have a crowbar and medal under the bed!\n\ni mean, it's nice to be acknowledged, nice for your work to be acknowledged. but it's not what you do it for. you do it for the work. and if you're doing it for prizes, you're in big trouble.\n\nand who knows, there could be even more awards on the way: last week she came out with a new live album – her first ever – made from newly-uncovered tapes of a made-for-tv concert in 1980, when she was at the height of her vocal powers.\n\nto watch linda ronstadt perform you're no good, from her new album, linda ronstadt live in hollywood, click on the video player:\n\nnow, she says, she can't even sing in the shower.\n\nsmith asked, do you try?\n\nyeah, but it doesn't, i can't make sound, ronstadt replied.\n\nthey've talked over the years about various treatments that could make singing come back.\n\ni'm sure they'll find something eventually, you know? they're learning so much more about it every day.\n\nrhino records\n\ni mean, i'm 72. we're all gonna die. they say people usually die with parkinson's. they don't always die of it, because it's so slow-moving, so i figure i'll die of something. and i've watched people die, so i'm not as afraid of dying. i'm afraid of suffering, but i'm not afraid of dying.\n\nand ever the performer, she says she'd like to go out singing.\n\nthat's the way i'd like to die, is right in the middle of a note! she said.\n\nas of right now, there are no more conversations with linda ronstadt on the books. but at 72, she's learned never to say never. and at the end of her appearance in l.a., as she started to leave the stage, she hesitated for just a moment. maybe that's because, like her millions of fans, linda ronstadt is not quite ready to say goodbye.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by john d'amelio.

will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than president trump with the economy?\n\nsanders: well, you're right. the economy is doing really great for people like mr. bloomberg and other billionaires.\n\n(applause)\n\nsanders: in the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.\n\nbut you know what? for the ordinary american, things are not so good. last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans.\n\nthat is not an economy that's working for the american people. that's an economy working for the 1 percent.\n\nwe're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nbloomberg: senator...\n\no'donnell: mayor bloomberg...\n\nbloomberg: senator...\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbloomberg: senator...\n\no'donnell: mayor bloomberg, i'll let you respond to that.\n\ndo you think senator sanders' economy would be better for america than president trump's?\n\nbloomberg: i -- i think that donald trump thinks it would be better if he's president. i do not think so.\n\nvladimir putin thinks that donald trump should be president of the united states.\n\nand that's why russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him.\n\nsanders: oh, mr. bloomberg.\n\nlet me tell mr. putin, ok, i'm not a good friend of president xi of china. i think president xi is an authoritarian leader.\n\nand let me tell mr. putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring americans against americans, hey, mr. putin, if i'm president of the united states, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more american elections.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\no'donnell: senator warren?\n\nbuttigieg: look, we know what the president -- what russia wants. it's chaos.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren (d-ma), presidential candidate: so, look, the way i see this is that bernie is winning right now because the democratic party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so.\n\n(applause)\n\nwarren: you know, but bernie and i agree on a lot of things, but i think i would make a better president than bernie.\n\nand the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen.\n\nbernie and i both wanted to help rein in wall street. in 2008, we both got our chance. but i dug in. i fought the big banks. i built the coalitions, and i won.\n\nbernie and i both want to see universal health care, but bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.\n\no'donnell: thank...\n\nwarren: i dug in. i did the work. and then bernie's team trashed me for it.\n\nwe need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. progressives have got one shot. and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.\n\nking: mayor buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nking: why would the russians want to be working on behalf of bernie sanders?\n\nbuttigieg: i will tell you what the russians want. they don't have a political party. they want chaos.\n\nand chaos is what is coming our way. i mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with bernie sanders vs. donald trump.\n\n(laughter)\n\nbuttigieg: think about what that will be like for this country.\n\n(applause)\n\nbuttigieg: and, meanwhile, folks at home, from south carolina to south bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an american majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.\n\nbut, also, there's a majority of the american people who i think right now just want to be able to turn on the tv, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbuttigieg: we have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n\no'donnell: mr. steyer.\n\nking: mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: bernie sanders' analysis is right.\n\nthe difference is, i don't like his solutions. i don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families.\n\ni think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector.\n\nbut we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. the answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. the answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n\nking: vice president biden?\n\n(applause)\n\nsteyer: we need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to donald trump.\n\ni'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs.\n\n(applause)\n\nsteyer: donald trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the american economy. we have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for american working people.\n\no'donnell: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\ngayle?\n\nking: mr. steyer, thank you. your time is up.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nking: vice president biden?\n\nbiden: you know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive.\n\nwalking distance of here is mother emanuel church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist.\n\nbernie voted five times against the brady bill and wanted a waiting period...\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbiden: no, let me finish.\n\n2010-2015 josh\n\na waiting period of 12 hours. i'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what i suggest until you are cleared.\n\nin addition to that, being progressive, he thought barack obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary barack obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. we got a lot done\n\n(applause)\n\nking: senator sanders -- senator sanders, your response.\n\nsanders: you know, pete mentioned -- i'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsanders: i wonder why. and maybe, you know, pete mentions what the american people want. i will tell you, pete, what the american people want, and, joe, what the american people want. they don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding.\n\nbuttigieg: all right, let's clear this up once and for all.\n\nsanders: pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires.\n\nbuttigieg: you've got people believing something that is false. this needs to be cleared up.\n\nsanders: joe, i think, has gotten a little bit more. what the american people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues i raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. making public colleges and universities tuition-free. and finally, doing what every other major country on earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a medicare for all, single-payer system.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: i can't allow -- i can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. senator sanders...\n\nking: we're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond.\n\nbuttigieg: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. the idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires...\n\nsanders: i didn't say that, pete.\n\nbuttigieg: fifty people, all right. in charleston alone, just in charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. that means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.\n\nin fact, i shouldn't miss the opportunity, if you're watching right now and you support my campaign, go to peteforamerica.com, and chip in. and if you are watching right now, and you're a billionaire, i will raise your taxes. but if you'd like to defeat donald trump, please go to peteforamerica.com and donate legal maximum of $2,800, if you're a billionaire.\n\nking: all right, all right, mayor buttigieg.\n\nvice president biden, i want to make -- i want to bring us to another topic. we're in south carolina. it's the first primary with a significant black voting population. your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. and i'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.\n\nbiden: well, first of all, the latest poll i saw, my numbers -- i'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.\n\nking: yes, yes, you're correct. you're correct.\n\n(applause)\n\nbiden: but look, look...\n\nking: but senator sanders is in striking distance of you. you are within the margin of error in this state.\n\nbiden: well, it depends which -- look, i've earned the vote, i've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the african-american community, not just here but across the country. i've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. we've created jobs for people.\n\nthe people know me. my entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. i don't expect anything. i plan to earn the vote. i'm here to ask. i'm here to earn it. but, folks, i intend to win in south carolina, and i will win the african-american vote here in south carolina.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: mr. biden, will you continue if you do not win south carolina? you have said that south carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. if you don't win south carolina, will you continue in this race?\n\nbiden: i will win south carolina.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right, sir.\n\nmayor bloomberg, i'd like to bring you into this conversation. i want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. you've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. what exactly are you apologizing for?\n\nbloomberg: we let it get out of control and when i realized that, i cut it back by 95 percent. and i've apologized and asked for forgiveness. i've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how i can better position myself and what i should have done and what i should do next time.\n\nbut let me tell you, i have been working very hard. we've improved the school system for black and brown students in new york city. we've increased the jobs that are available to them. we've increased the housing that's available to them. we have programs like the...\n\nking: but what more can you do about this issue, mr. mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? it continues to follow you.\n\nbloomberg: no -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. but if you talk to the people in new york city, i have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. a lot of them are in the audience tonight. and i've earned the respect of people in new york city.\n\ni was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the united states for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. it is safer for everybody. the school system is better. the budget is under control. we've done the things that people need in new york city for all ethnicities.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: mayor buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. do you think the new york city's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?\n\nbuttigieg: yes, in effect, it was. because it was about profiling people based on their race. and the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. and i'm not here to score points. i come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.\n\nand i come to this with some humility because i'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. none of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.\n\nnone of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...\n\no'donnell: thank you, mayor.\n\nbuttigieg: ... is actually listen to those who do.\n\nbloomberg: i know -- wait a second. i know that if i were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. and i know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. that's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.\n\no'donnell: senator klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?\n\nklobuchar: yes, and i think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. martin luther king once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. so when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.\n\nand to me that means sentencing reform, like the first step act, and extending that to the states with the second step act. it means equal opportunity. because if we don't pass representative clyburn's bill out of south carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.\n\nand we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. and then, finally, voting. while we are all sitting here debating, wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. georgia kicked 100,000 off. as president, i will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: senator warren, i'm coming to you. i want to direct this question to you because you -- because mayor bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat donald trump. you said mayor bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. what did you mean by that?\n\nwarren: i mean that mayor bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. we're here in charleston, and you know who is going to be in charleston later this week is donald trump. he's going to be here to raise money for his buddy senator lindsey graham, who funded lindsey graham's campaign for re-election last time? it was mayor bloomberg.\n\nand that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded. in 2016, he dumped $12 million into the pennsylvania senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing republican senator. and i just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. she lost by a single point.\n\nin 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another republican senator against a woman challenger. that was me. it didn't work, but he tried hard.\n\n(applause)\n\nwarren: i don't care how much money mayor bloomberg has. the core of the democratic party will never trust him. he has not earned their trust. i will. and the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right, senator warren, thank you.\n\nmayor bloomberg, would you like to respond? mayor bloomberg?\n\nbloomberg: i have been training for this job since i stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. i know what to do. i've shown i know how to run a country. i've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world.\n\ni am not the -- i'm the one choice that makes some sense. i have the experience. i have the resources. and i have the record. and all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. when people hired me to run new york city three times, in an overwhelmingly democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.\n\no'donnell: mr. vice president?\n\nwarren: i was mentioned in this.\n\nbiden: no...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: i'd like to respond.\n\no'donnell: go ahead, senator.\n\nwarren: he called me out by name.\n\nbiden: there was a -- i thought...\n\nwarren: ... and referred to what i talk about as a sideshow. you know, this is personal for me. when i was 21 years old, i got my first job as a special education teacher. i loved that job. and by the end of the first year, i was visibly pregnant.\n\nthe principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. pregnancy discrimination, you bet. but i was 21 years old. i didn't have a union to protect me. and i didn't have any federal law on my side. so i packed up my stuff, and i went home. at least i didn't have a boss who said to me, kill it, the way that mayor bloomberg is alleged to have said...\n\nbloomberg: i never said that. oh, come on.\n\nwarren: ... to one of his pregnant employees. people want a chance to hear...\n\n(audience boos)\n\npeople want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbloomberg: i never said that. and for the record, if she was a teacher in new york city, she would never have had that problem. we treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.\n\n(applause)\n\no'donnell: well, mayor bloomberg, senator warren has raised...\n\nwarren: then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. the bloomberg corporations and mayor bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. they are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. if he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out...\n\n(applause)\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: ... so that they can tell their stories the way i can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\no'donnell: thank you. thank you. we have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but i want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. at the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. did these women take your jokes wrong? or were you wrong to make the jokes?\n\nbloomberg: probably wrong to make the jokes. i don't remember what they were. so i assume -- if it bothered them, i was wrong, and i apologize. i'm sorry for that.\n\nbut what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. and what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. i did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. the senator has got it. and i don't know what else she wants us to do.\n\nwarren: oh, i'll be clear.\n\nbloomberg: we're following exactly what she asked to do.\n\nwarren: i'll tell you exactly what i want you to do.\n\nbloomberg: and the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- i'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. we just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. we did what she asked. and, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. and by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across america.\n\nbuttigieg: if you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: sorry, mayor, you did not do what i asked.\n\nking: senator warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor.\n\nwarren: yes.\n\nking: he told a woman to get an abortion. what evidence do you have of that?\n\nwarren: her own words.\n\nking: and, mayor bloomberg, could you respond to this?\n\nbloomberg: i never said it, period, end of story. categorically never said it. when it was accused -- when i was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. but right now, i'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. i didn't take any pleasure in that. and we've just got to go on. but i never said it. come on.\n\nwarren: what i asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims...\n\nbloomberg: we are doing that, senator.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\no'donnell: we want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the democratic party.\n\nwarren: ok.\n\no'donnell: senator sanders, the cost of your agenda. yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. you've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending.\n\nsanders: over a 10-year period.\n\no'donnell: you've said medicare for all will cost $30 trillion.\n\nsanders: over a 10-year period.\n\no'donnell: but you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. can you do the math for the rest of us?\n\nsanders: how many hours do you have?\n\nking: two.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbiden: that's the problem.\n\nsanders: no, it's not the problem. all right, let's talk about medicare for all. i'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of yale university, published in lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. you know what it said? medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died.\n\nwhat we need to do is to do what every other major country on earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.\n\nour plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. one of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. another...\n\nklobuchar: bernie, let me -- let me respond to this.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: you asked me a question.\n\no'donnell: senator klobuchar, does the math add up?\n\nklobuchar: no, the math does not add up. in fact, just on 60 minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?\n\nsanders: not true.\n\nklobuchar: that is three times the american economy -- not the federal government -- the entire american economy. the medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years. that is true.\n\nas one prominent democrat once said, we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are, bernie. that prominent democrat was barack obama a few months ago. and i think that's what we should do. they are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion.\n\nsanders: first of all...\n\nklobuchar: what i think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and i have done together...\n\no'donnell: thank you, senator.\n\nklobuchar: ... and do something for the people of america.\n\nking: thank you, senator klobuchar.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nklobuchar: instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.\n\nking: mr. steyer -- mr. steyer...\n\nbuttigieg: i think we're talking about math.\n\nking: we'll get to you, mr. sanders.\n\nbuttigieg: let's talk about it.\n\nsteyer: can i say something?\n\nsanders: first of all...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsteyer: no, let me go.\n\nsanders: no, i think -- tom, i think she was talking about my plan, not yours.\n\nbuttigieg: i think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math.\n\nsanders: no, no, well, let's talk about math.\n\nbuttigieg: because let's talk about what it adds up to.\n\nsanders: let's talk about math.\n\nbuttigieg: let's talk about math, indeed. ok, so here's the math...\n\nsanders: if we do nothing is what...\n\nbuttigieg: no, here's the math.\n\nsanders: excuse me, can i respond to the attack?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: to do nothing is what will happen...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\no'donnell: senator sanders, you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: listen to the moderator, guys.\n\no'donnell: senator sanders. senator sanders.\n\nsanders: the moderator -- is it my turn?\n\nbiden: this helps a lot, doesn't?\n\no'donnell: senator sanders, you have been name checked. you are allowed to respond.\n\nsanders: ok. what the health and human services have said in analyzing health care costs, what yale -- recent yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. we would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. what every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, medicare for all will save money. ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nklobuchar: bernie, i was talking about -- i was talking about...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nking: we would like -- senator sanders, we would like to bring mr. steyer in on this conversation.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsteyer: mr. steyer, please.\n\nklobuchar: i was talking about all your programs.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsteyer: excuse me, amy. this conversation shows a huge risk for the democratic party. we are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a republican.\n\nand let me say that i got into this race because i wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the american people. and i am scared.\n\n(applause)\n\nif we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing donald trump.\n\no'donnell: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: and that is something -- i still have some time. and let me say this.\n\no'donnell: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: that is a risk that will hurt the american people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk.\n\no'donnell: thank you. let's keep this topic going. mayor pete?\n\nbuttigieg: so let's do this math. senator sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. that's an incredible shrinking price tag. at some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. now there are new numbers.\n\ni'll tell you exactly what it adds up to.\n\nit adds to four more years of donald trump, kevin mccarthy as speaker of the house, and the inability to get the senate into democratic hands.\n\nthe time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. not only is this a way to get donald trump reelected.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbuttigieg: we got a house to worry about. we got a senate to worry about. and this is -- this is really important.\n\nlook...\n\nbiden: hello?\n\nbuttigieg: ... if you want to keep the house in democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the house blue, 40 democrats, who are not running on your platform.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: they are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbuttigieg: i want to send those democrats back to the united states house.\n\nking: vice president biden.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbuttigieg: let's listen to them...\n\nking: vice president biden.\n\nbuttigieg: ... when they say that they don't want to be out there defending senator sanders...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nking: thank you, mayor buttigieg. thank you, mayor buttigieg.\n\nvice president biden, please.\n\nbiden: whoa. whoa. whoa.\n\ni guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should.\n\n(laughter)\n\nbiden: here's the deal. here's the deal.\n\nlook, a guy who's a friend of mine down here named fritz hollings -- he passed away -- he said, you want to know what a woman will do, look what they have done. look what they have done.\n\nyou talk about -- concerned about race. well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state.\n\nthey, in fact, made sure that, in georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. they, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. and then he said he was proud of his accomplishment.\n\nyou talk about what we're talking about with bernie. bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. the fact of the matter is...\n\nsteyer: ok. but i get to answer.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbiden: no, no, no.\n\nsteyer: i get to answer that.\n\nbiden: the -- look -- look...\n\nsteyer: no, that...\n\nbiden: ... fact is...\n\nsteyer: you're out of time.\n\ni get to answer...\n\nbiden: here's the deal.\n\ni'm not out of time. you spoke over time, and i'm going to talk.\n\nhere's the deal.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbiden: here's the deal.\n\nthe fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. look at what's happening here. we have to win the senate back.\n\nand, by the way, i went into all of those races that got 41 new democrats. the majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\no'donnell: and, mr. vice president, i have to allow -- yes, mr. mayor.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\no'donnell: mr. mayor, you're allowed to respond.\n\nsteyer: i bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. and i investigated. and i sold it.\n\nbloomberg: ok.\n\nbiden: but you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsteyer: i get to answer this question.\n\nand, in fact, since then, i have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. i have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.\n\ni have worked tirelessly on this. and you know i'm right. you wrote the crime bill that you called...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbiden: where we come from, that's called tommy come lately.\n\nbloomberg: there are other people here.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsteyer: ... crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and latino men in prison.\n\nbiden: not true.\n\nbloomberg: ok. let me say something.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\no'donnell: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: there's something going on here. i have worked for racial justice...\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nking: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: ... completely. and that is an absolute unfair statement.\n\no'donnell: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nklobuchar: all i know...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbiden: tommy come lately.\n\nking: mayor bloomberg. mayor bloomberg.\n\nklobuchar: ... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch donald trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\n\nbiden: look...\n\nklobuchar: so, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.\n\nwe have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. and i am the only one in the new hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand.\n\ni like bernie. we came in together to the senate. but i do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket.\n\n(applause)\n\nklobuchar: and if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to vanderbilt university in tennessee, last congress, i was the most effective democrat in the u.s. senate on 15 metrics.\n\nbernie and elizabeth were in the bottom half. it matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.\n\nbloomberg: ok. gayle...\n\nklobuchar: it is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.\n\nand especially with the african-american community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. and i think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. and that's why i ask for your support.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nking: mayor bloomberg, please.\n\nbloomberg: let's just go on the record.\n\nthey talk about 40 democrats; 21 of those were people that i spent $100 million to help elect. all of the new democrats that came in and put nancy pelosi in charge and gave the congress the ability to control this president...\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\nbloomberg: ... i -- i got them.\n\nnumber two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. the federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. we get $3.5 trillion in revenue. we lose $1 trillion a year.\n\nthat's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21.\n\nwe just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. but if you...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbloomberg: let me finish.\n\nif you keep on going, we will elect bernie. bernie will lose to donald trump. and donald trump and the house and the senate and some of the statehouses will all go red.\n\nand then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.\n\no'donnell: mayor bloomberg, thank you.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\no'donnell: i will allow senator sanders a quick response, and then senator warren.\n\nsanders: thank you very much, norah.\n\no'donnell: senator sanders, a quick response, and then senator warren.\n\nsanders: thank you very much.\n\nmayor bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. the problem is, they're all billionaires.\n\n(booing)\n\nsanders: now, if you look -- oh.\n\non the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, mr. bloomberg, i beat trump 47 of those 50 times.\n\nif you look at battleground states like michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania, polling just done this sunday...\n\nbloomberg: the polls aren't the election.\n\nsanders: ... i beat trump.\n\nand if you want to beat trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented...\n\n(applause)\n\nsanders: ... grassroots movement of black and white and latino, native american and asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nsanders: that's what our movement is about.\n\nbloomberg: can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate republicans going over and voting for him?\n\nsanders: absolutely.\n\nbloomberg: and you have to do that, or you can't win.\n\nwarren: you know, that is...\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nsenator warren.\n\nwarren: that is the problem.\n\nand that is that a progressive agenda is popular, mayor bloomberg.\n\nand, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. that's what matters.\n\ni talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. it's why i also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.\n\nbut it's so much more than that. as democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. we need to speak of the prosperity we can build together.\n\nhow about a wealth tax in america? because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field.\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nwarren: put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.\n\no'donnell: thank you, senator.\n\n(applause)\n\nwarren: and start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million americans.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: we need to talk about our aspirations, our hopes.\n\nthis is a moment...\n\no'donnell: senator...\n\nwarren: ... to choose hope over fear.\n\no'donnell: senator, thank you.\n\nwarren: this is our moment.\n\no'donnell: senator, thank you.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\no'donnell: we have to take a quick break.\n\nwhen we come back, the democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on cbs.\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\n(commercial break)\n\n(applause)\n\nking: i'm gayle king with norah o'donnell. joining us now on the question here in charleston, south carolina are cbs news colleagues, the a team, bill whitaker of 60 minutes, chief washington correspondent, that's major garrett, and margaret brennan, moderator of face the nation.\n\nwe're going to begin with you, vice president biden, for this part. just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the mother emanuel church. we all remember that day back in 2015.\n\nand every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. you all have plans, i know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. but congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. and just think about this, in those 25 years we've had columbine, newtown, parkland, las vegas. we could go on and on.\n\nvice president biden, i want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?\n\nbiden: because i'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. i beat the nra twice. i got assault weapons banned. i got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. i got them eliminated. except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in florida and it was not reauthorized.\n\nin addition to, that i passed the brady bill with waiting periods. i led that fight. but my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. imagine if i stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. we would give immunity to tobacco companies. that has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. more than all the wars, including vietnam, from that point on.\n\ncarnage on our streets. and i want to tell you, if i'm elected, nra, i'm coming for you, and gun manufacturers, i'm going to take you on and i'm going to beat you. i'm the only one who has done it.\n\n(applause)\n\nbuttigieg: that's why we have got to change what washington can deliver.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: so this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done. i've been in the senate. what i've seen is gun safety legislation introduced, get a majority, and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster. understand this, the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry.\n\nit gives a veto to the oil industry. it's going to give a veto on immigration. until we're willing to dig in and say that if mitch mcconnell is going to do to the next democratic president what he did to president obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the american people.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nking: we're going to stay on this top and allow senator...\n\nbiden: ... and i can beat mitch mcconnell.\n\nwarren: understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change.\n\no'donnell: i want to allow senator sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. you've taken on pharmaceutical companies. and you've taken on big tech. why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?\n\nsanders: well, you know, joe has voted for terrible trade agreements.\n\n(booing)\n\nsanders: no, no, no, no, no. joe voted for the war in iraq. my point was, not to be -- i have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. that was a bad vote. i have today a d-minus voting record from the nra. thirty years ago, i likely lost a race for the one seat for congress in vermont because 30 years ago, i opposed -- i supported a ban on assault weapons. thirty years ago.\n\nright now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the american people want, not what the nra wants.\n\nbiden: ok, but wait a second...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: ... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago.\n\nbloomberg: i think she recognized me, thank you. i have a 6 million-person organization around this country. moms demand action and everytown.\n\n(applause)\n\nbloomberg: we have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. so you can do it. it's congress that can't seem to do it. and i don't know why we think they're going to do it. the vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the nra. and certainly senator sanders has supported the nra.\n\nbut we can do this. we have just got to stop talking about it.\n\nklobuchar: but the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. so i have long supported the assault weapon ban. i am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an ak-47.\n\nbiden: i wrote that law.\n\nklobuchar: that bill, along with -- you didn't write that bill. i wrote that bill.\n\nbiden: i wrote the bill, the violence against women act...\n\nklobuchar: ok. you did you that.\n\nbiden: ... that took out of the hands of people who abused their...\n\nklobuchar: ok. we'll have a fact check look at this.\n\nbiden: let's look at the fact check...\n\nklobuchar: oh my goodness.\n\nbiden: the only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. i couldn't get that covered. you, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and mitch mcconnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the violence against women act across the board.\n\nklobuchar: ok. so, if i could finish. i have the bill. anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. also to close the charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. universal background checks.\n\nbut let me say how we win this. we have got to win in the middle of the country. and while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, i'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in republican congressional districts over and over again, including michele bachmann's district.\n\nso having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. i look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle dick in the deer stand? they do not. so coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key.\n\no'donnell: senator klobuchar, thank you.\n\nwe want to allow many people to get in on this topic. mayor buttigieg.\n\nbuttigieg: i'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. but i want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that bernie sanders took, this is a current bad position that bernie sanders holds.\n\n(applause)\n\nand we're in south carolina. how are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? we are in this state...\n\n(booing)\n\nbuttigieg: we are in the state where strom thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. no less a senate traditional figure than harry reid has called for it to go. it has got to go, because otherwise washington will not deliver. i was in high school when the columbine shooting happened. and i remember everybody in washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.\n\nand then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. shame on us if we allow there to be a third. and also...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: ... in terms of making the case, i think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what i trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an american school or church or neighbor.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right, senator sanders, please.\n\nsanders: thirty years ago, i supported a ban on assault weapons. mike bloomberg has started a very good organization, moms demand actions. congratulations.\n\nbloomberg: thank you.\n\nsanders: they have credited me with gun sense, as you know.\n\nbloomberg: yes, we did.\n\nsanders: furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the american people. here is the good news. because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the american people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the nra.\n\nand i am proud that i have a d-minus voting record from the nra. if elected president, it will get worse than that.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right, mr. steyer, please? mr. steyer?\n\nsteyer: look, it isn't a question of the american people deciding that we have too much gun violence. everyone in america knows we have too much gun violence. the problem we have is that corporations have bought washington, d.c.\n\nthe gun manufacturers own the senate of the united states. so even though more than 90 percent of americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the senate.\n\nso the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the senate of the united states in a material way? and there are two things. that's why i am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of mitch mcconnell and lindsey graham and ted cruz.\n\n(applause)\n\nbut i am also -- senator sanders is right. we need to win a huge victory across the board.\n\nking: all right, mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: democrats need to go to the grassroots. i built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the united states.\n\nking: your time's up, sir.\n\nsteyer: the way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize.\n\nking: your time's up, sir. bill whitaker?\n\nsteyer: that's what it's going to take in 2020.\n\nking: your time's up, sir. bill whitaker?\n\nwhitaker: let's talk about education. south carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. black students here consistently score worse than white students. mayor bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in new york city was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. as president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?\n\nbloomberg: i'm not sure they're appropriate every place. i can only tell you, in new york, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. we had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. they've helped each other.\n\ni saw a statistic the other day, when i came into office, zero new york city schools were in the top 25 of the state. when i left, 23 out of 25 were from new york city. we've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. we've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have.\n\ni raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. i put an extra $5 billion into our school system. i value education. it is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. and rather than just talk about it in new york, we actually did it.\n\n(applause)\n\nwhitaker: senator warren?\n\nwarren: so this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. and i'm going to start with my secretary of education. my secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school.\n\n(applause)\n\nmy secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. and my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools.\n\n(applause)\n\none more thing. my secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. we need to support our children. but, look, we want to build a future in this country? we build a future by investing in our children. i've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools.\n\nwhitaker: thank you. thank you, senator.\n\nwarren: education is not free. we must invest in the future of our children.\n\n(applause)\n\nwhitaker: senator sanders?\n\nsanders: this campaign, our campaign, our campaign is about changing american priorities. instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we're going to have high-quality, universal childcare for every family in this country.\n\nbecause the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. we are going to triple funding for low-income title i schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the zip code in which they live. we're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on wall street speculation. and we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in america earns less than $60,000 a year.\n\nwhitaker: thank you, senator.\n\nsanders: we want great teachers.\n\nklobuchar: can i...\n\nwhitaker: mayor buttigieg?\n\nbuttigieg: look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. i'm a little biased, because i'm married to one. and i get an education about education every day i come home.\n\ni have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.\n\nand now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.\n\nwe have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. and, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. it also means investing.\n\nwhitaker: thank you...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: i'm proposing an education access...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: one way we -- one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwhitaker: we're going to pass this on to major.\n\ngarrett: candidates, good evening. candidates, good evening.\n\nwarren: people across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. this is an issue we need to talk about.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: and that's what my plan would do, through the education...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ngarrett: as we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, twitter, this debate is no different. so i want to put a question from twitter to you, senator klobuchar. this is from casey pennington. how will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?\n\nklobuchar: thank you. this is one of the first times we've talked about housing. and i put forward an extensive policy.\n\ni think -- when i've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live.\n\nso the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the section 8 backlog of applicants. there are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. and i have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.\n\nsecondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.\n\nand i want to make clear, given south carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. it's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.\n\nso for me, it's building a coalition. and i actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done.\n\nwarren: this is a point...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ngarrett: senator warren, hold on one second, because i want to -- i want to...\n\nwarren: this is a point where we need to talk about race, though.\n\ngarrett: i understand.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nwarren: it is not enough to talk about housing neutrally...\n\nbiden: can we just speak up when we want to? is that the idea?\n\nwarren: ... and just be race-blind. it is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against african-americans having an opportunity to buy homes.\n\n(applause)\n\nthat's red-lining.\n\ngarrett: mayor...\n\nwarren: and while mayor bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on african-americans and on latinos, in fact, i was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. we have a -- i have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically...\n\ngarrett: senator warren, thank you.\n\nwarren: ... is a piece...\n\ngarrett: senator warren, thank you.\n\nwarren: ... to deal with the effects of red-lining. we can no longer pretend that everything is race-neutral. we have got to address race consciously, what's happening in this country.\n\n(applause)\n\ngarrett: ok. mayor bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. i want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what senator warren just said on twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.\n\nbloomberg: yes, she's -- i'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. you can go back and look at the record. i fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.\n\nlet me also say, because just -- since i have the floor for a second, that i really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, i guess, would be the right word for it...\n\n(laughter)\n\n... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- i'm surprised they show up, because i would have thought after i did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.\n\n(audience boos)\n\nbut let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in new york city. and i listened to them. they're in congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. but if you change something like the president, they would. no, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.\n\ni did it in new york city. i got the republican state senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. you can work across the aisle. you just have to know how to deal with people.\n\ngarrett: mayor bloomberg, thank you very much. back to you, bill.\n\nwhitaker: vice president biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both democratic and republican administrations. how do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?\n\nbiden: two ways. number one, my entire life i've been involved with the black community. i was a public defender.\n\ni worked in the projects, i came along, and the first thing i did as the chairman of the judiciary committee, extended the voting rights act eventually for 25 years. and i have been deeply involved. and my first effort i had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.\n\nthe way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. we go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. that's how you create wealth.\n\nsecondly, i provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. thirdly, i go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. they're being bought out. you cannot find a place to live.\n\nand thirdly, i make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. we've got to deal with the institutional racism.\n\nwhitaker: thank you, mr. vice president.\n\nbiden: i note how you cut me off all the time but i'm not going to be quiet anymore, ok?\n\nwhitaker: mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: every single policy area in the united states has a gigantic subtext of race. we're talking about education. we're talking about criminal justice. we're talking about housing. we're talking about loans. i started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. basically, to make loans to black-owned, latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. we've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units.\n\nbut more than that, i believe i'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.\n\n(applause)\n\nsteyer: something happened. we should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in america of african-americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the united states of america and leading the united states of america from a moral standpoint.\n\nwhitaker: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbrennan: senator klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. senator klobuchar...\n\nbuttigieg: ... for this whole campaign, i don't know where you got the impression...\n\nbrennan: if you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you.\n\nsenator klobuchar, i'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. and they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. so how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?\n\nklobuchar: people aren't always aware, i know you are in south carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. so the answer is one size doesn't fit all. and one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. and actually, i am leading -- the lead democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.\n\nthe other issue is we don't have enough personnel. and so that's where we get to this education plan.. and i don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. what i think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.\n\nwe're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. we're going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. we're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. we're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses.\n\nso putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.\n\nfinal thing is comprehensive immigration reform. i have passed...\n\nbrennan: senator, time.\n\nklobuchar: i have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. we need to expand that.\n\nbrennan: mayor buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question.\n\nbuttigieg: yes, so, when i was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like south carolina. we're seeing hospital closures right and left. and we're seeing them, in particular, in states where medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.\n\nsee, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. all of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. and that harms everyone.\n\nbrennan: you're out of time, sir.\n\nbuttigieg: it's why in my frederick douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st century voting rights act.\n\n(applause)\n\nbrennan: senator sanders.\n\nsanders: yes, i'm very proud working with congressman jim clyburn, south carolina, that we increased funding for the community health center program by $11 billion as part of the affordable care act, which now provides for 9 million americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill.\n\nwe also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas.\n\nthe advantage of a medicare for all health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: but in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. and we're talking about a plan that...\n\nbrennan: thank you. next topic. gayle?\n\nbuttigieg: ... even goes beyond even what they do...\n\nking: i'm sorry, we're going to go to mayor bloomberg. we're going to change topics.\n\nmayor bloomberg, as mayor of new york, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. so if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?\n\nbloomberg: well, i think what's right for new york city isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. so let's get serious here.\n\nbut i do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. the -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. we should do something about that. but just a look what happened with smoking.\n\nwe did ban smoking in new york city in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. and it has spread across america, across europe, across latin america, even into places in the middle east and into the far east. it has saved an enormous number of lives.\n\nso it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. and one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. so there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.\n\n(applause)\n\nbloomberg: and he has defunded -- he had defunded centers for disease control, cdc, so we don't have the organization we need. this is a very serious thing. as you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be.\n\nking: we're going to talk about that.\n\nbloomberg: we don't have anybody to respond. i'm sorry.\n\nking: we're going to talk about that in our next segment. before i leave you, are new yorkers living longer because of your policies?\n\nbloomberg: there's no question about that.\n\nking: all right.\n\nbloomberg: before i left, life expectancy in new york city had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when i left, it was three years greater than the national average.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right. vice president biden, please. vice president biden.\n\nbiden: look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the defense department called darpa, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. they came up with the internet, i mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.\n\ni'm going to do the same thing at the national institute of health. we're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, alzheimer's, and cancer. and we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.\n\nwe can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. the american people support it. even republicans will support it. we have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.\n\n(applause)\n\nking: all right, senator (sic) biden, thank you.\n\no'donnell: senator klobuchar, senator sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...\n\n(applause)\n\no'donnell: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. as a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?\n\nklobuchar: well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, i want to do that, too. and i also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. i think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.\n\ni think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. and it's not necessarily because of marijuana. it is because of things like opioids and the like. and that's why one of the first plans i put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.\n\nand the way you do that is with drug courts. the way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the justice department, and while getting their advice.\n\nking: all right, thank you, senator klobuchar.\n\nsanders: norah, can i respond?\n\nking: mayor bloomberg...\n\nbiden: can i respond to that, as well?\n\nsanders: can i respond? i was mentioned...\n\nking: i'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on.\n\nbloomberg: look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. for dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before.\n\n(applause)\n\nnumber two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.\n\nbut, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. they say go very slowly. they haven't done enough research. and the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.\n\nuntil we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. but the cat's out of the bag. so some states have it, you're not going to take it away. get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.\n\nking: all right, thank you, mr. mayor.\n\no'donnell: senator sanders, you were name checked.\n\nsanders: thank you. all right, look, you're right. we have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on earth, including china. and one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs.\n\nso i do believe that, on day one, we will change the federal controlled substance act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. that's insane. we're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.\n\nwhat we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana.\n\n(applause)\n\nand i'll tell you what else we're going to do. we're going to provide help to the african-american, latino, native american community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.\n\nking: all right, senator sanders, thank you...\n\nbiden: i wrote the drug court bill.\n\nking: we passed the halfway mark.\n\nbiden: can i respond to this? i wrote the -- i wrote the bill that set up drug courts.\n\nking: all right. thank you, vice president biden. we will get back to you.\n\nthe cbs news democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break.\n\n(commercial break)\n\no'donnell: welcome back, the cbs news democratic debate. each of you is campaigning for the role as commander-in-chief, where you will command 1.3 million u.s. troops and be responsible for protecting america's national security. there are also 53,000 here in south carolina.\n\nyou said, senator warren, you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the middle east and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops.\n\nwarren: i do.\n\no'donnell: how does that protect america's national security?\n\nwarren: look, a president's job, first job, is to keep america safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. all three of my brothers served in the military, and i understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.\n\nthat means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. we are not winning in afghanistan. we are not winning in the middle east.\n\nwhat we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox. we need a strong military. we also need a strong state department. those are our eyes and ears on the ground. they are our frontlines in diplomacy.\n\nwe need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. we need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. we need not to cut and run on our allies.\n\nand we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators.\n\nwe need not to cut and run on our allies. we need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way.\n\no'donnell: mayor bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. would you pull all combat troops out of the middle east?\n\nbloomberg: no. you want to cut it back as much as you can, but i think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. we have to be able to stop terrorism. and there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.\n\nwe shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. we should go to war only as a last resort. nobody argues with that.\n\nbut this is a dangerous world. and if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, i don't know what's going to teach us what to. this -- we have to do something, and i think the budget that we -- the things that i've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nbloomberg: they're doing a good job.\n\no'donnell: thank you, mayor bloomberg.\n\ngayle?\n\nking: mayor buttigieg, i'd like to go to you as the only veteran on stage. can you weigh in on this?\n\nbuttigieg: well, the first time i ever set foot in south carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near fort jackson. and that was to get ready to go to afghanistan, where i saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. our allies and our adversaries knew it.\n\nthe president has torn that to shreds. and so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the united states.\n\n(applause)\n\nthe second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and i guess i disagree with the mayor; i don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. but we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.\n\nbut what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?\n\nright now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists...\n\nking: time, mr. mayor.\n\nbuttigieg: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall.\n\nking: i know it goes fast...\n\n(applause)\n\n... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time.\n\n(laughter)\n\nso we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time.\n\nbiden: good idea.\n\nking: senator klobuchar -- good idea, right, mr. vice president?\n\nsenator klobuchar, today -- as we were coming over here today...\n\n(laughter)\n\ni promise, mr. vice president, we are going to get to you today. i promise.\n\nbiden: you keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet.\n\nking: i've never broken a promise.\n\nbiden: well, let's get to it.\n\nking: senator klobuchar...\n\nklobuchar: why don't you let me answer, ok?\n\nking: there was breaking news from the cdc about the coronavirus. and so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. but the cdc says this. it's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when.\n\nthe question to you is this, would you close the borders to americans who have been exposed to the coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?\n\nklobuchar: well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. we don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help.\n\nand i would agree, when mayor bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the cdc; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, i would do all of that.\n\nbut i want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the american people because this is so serious. i'm not going to give my website right now. i'm going to give the cdc's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.\n\nand i think the answers, as president, what would i do, i would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one.\n\nking: thank you, senator.\n\nklobuchar: i would have better relations with our allies and i would support, because i know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in columbia, south carolina, or houston, texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.\n\no'donnell: senator, thank you.\n\n(applause)\n\nmr. vice president, we reached a turning point today with the cdc, warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close, members of the trump administration saying we don't have enough medical masks if necessary.\n\nwhat would you do?\n\nbiden: what we did with ebola -- i was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the united states, saved millions of lives. and what we did, we set up, i helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases.\n\nwe increased the budget of the cdc. we increased the nih budget. we should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. we did it. we stopped it.\n\nand the second thing i'd point out to you is that what i would do immediately is restore the funding. he cut the funding for cdc. he tried to cut the funding for nih. he cut the funding for the entire effort.\n\nand here's the deal. i would be on the phone with china and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist.\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nbiden: i could get that done. no one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders. i'm the only one that has.\n\no'donnell: senator sanders?\n\n(applause)\n\nsanders: in the white house today -- in the white house today, we have a self-described great genius -- self-described -- and this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months. april is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the white house has determined -- i wish i was kidding; that is what he said.\n\nwhat do we have to do? whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the world health organization. obviously, we have to make sure the cdc, the nih, our infectious departments, are fully funded.\n\nthis is a global problem.\n\no'donnell: thank you.\n\nsanders: we've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it.\n\no'donnell: senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. margaret brennan?\n\nbrennan: thank you, norah.\n\nmayor bloomberg, you've said that president xi jinping of china is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the u.s. must cooperate with beijing.\n\nhow far does that go? would you allow chinese firms to build critical u.s. infrastructure?\n\nbloomberg: no, i would not. and i think the chinese government has not been open. their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. they -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, i suppose.\n\nbut we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with china, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. we have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. we would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need.\n\nand, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. and he -- but he does play to his constituency. you can negotiate with him. that's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.\n\nbrennan: thank you, mr. mayor.\n\nvice president biden?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nvice president biden, same question to you. would you allow chinese firms to build critical u.s. infrastructure?\n\nbiden: no, i would not. and i spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. this is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small d, bone in his body.\n\nthis is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million uighurs in reconstruction camps, meaning concentration camps. this is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in hong kong, and this is a guy who i was able to convince should join the international agreement at the paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved.\n\nyou can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said we're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone.\n\nhe said, what do you expect me to do, when i was over there.\n\ni said, we're going to fly right through it. we flew b-1 bombers through it. we've got to make it clear. they must play by the rules...\n\nbrennan: thank you, mr. vice president.\n\nbiden: ... period, period, period.\n\nbrennan: senator warren, same question. would you allow chinese firms to build infrastructure?\n\nwarren: we -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. and that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes.\n\nwe know that mayor bloomberg has been doing business with china for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes.\n\nhe plans to release them after super tuesday. it is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. we have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.\n\nbrennan: was that a yes or no?\n\nwarren: no, i would not.\n\nbrennan: ok. mayor bloomberg, would you like to respond?\n\nbloomberg: i got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, i've said they will be out. we probably have another couple of weeks left to go. we're doing it as fast we can. we've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. and when i was mayor of new york, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the white house.\n\nwarren: no, actually...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: my tax return is online light now.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbrennan: mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: i released my tax returns.\n\nwarren: yes.\n\nsteyer: that was easy to do. but i want to say something about foreign policy...\n\nbiden: how many years?\n\nsteyer: ten years.\n\ni want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th century or the 19th century. if you look at the biggest threats to the united states, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the united states. we're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need u.s. leadership for countries around the world.\n\nin fact, mr. trump's policy of us going it alone, of america first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. and it's time for us to deal with it that way. every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership and coalition.\n\nbrennan: new topic. senator sanders.\n\nsanders: can i say one word on...\n\nbrennan: you praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. you've praised the chinese communist party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. you also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in cuba and in nicaragua. can americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?\n\nsanders: i have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and i was really amazed at what mayor bloomberg just said a moment ago. he said that the chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? who elects the politburo? you have got a real dictatorship there. of course you have a dictatorship in cuba.\n\nwhat i said is what barack obama said in terms of cuba, that cuba made progress on education. yes, i think...\n\n(booing)\n\nsanders: really? really? literacy programs are bad?\n\nbuttigieg: yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).\n\nsanders: what barack obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. that was barack obama. occasionally...\n\nbiden: i talked to barack obama...\n\nsanders: excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy, and that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world in chile, in guatemala, in iran. and when dictatorships, whether it is the chinese or the cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. but you don't have to trade love letters with them.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbrennan: mr. vice president.\n\nbiden: barack obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the cuban government. he acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. but he went on and condemned the dictatorship. he went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee.\n\nhe also made sure to make it clear -- and by the way, i called to make sure that i was prepared to -- i never say (inaudible) my private conversations with him, but the fact of the matter is he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now.\n\n(applause)\n\nbiden: this man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did.\n\nsanders: that is untrue, categorically untrue.\n\nbiden: what did you tell them?\n\nsanders: i have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in saudi arabia that the united states government...\n\nbiden: how about cuba or nicaragua?\n\nsanders: ... has loved for years. cuba, nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad.\n\nbiden: period.\n\nsanders: but that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. that's what barack obama said.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nklobuchar: margaret, margaret, could i...\n\nbuttigieg: the only way we're going to restore...\n\nbrennan: mayor buttigieg.\n\nbuttigieg: ... american credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. and i am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to donald trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and bernie sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.\n\n(applause)\n\n(booing)\n\nbuttigieg: this is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. this is about 2020. we are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the cold war. and we're not going to win these critical, critical house and senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the castro regime. we've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.\n\n(applause)\n\n(booing)\n\nbrennan: senator sanders, your response.\n\nsanders: let us be clear, do we think health care for all, pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: well, you brought this up, let's talk about that.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: i'm happy to respond to the question because this is really important...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: ... do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: if you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: ... do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: let's talk about this. let's talk about what's radical about that plan.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: the things you just named are things...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: do you think immigration reform? the truth is, pete...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbrennan: one at a time.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: ... the american people support my agenda.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: the way you're talking about doing it is radical by...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nsanders: that is why i am beating trump in virtually every poll that is done, and why i will defeat him.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbuttigieg: we've got to open this up. universal health care, for example...\n\nbrennan: senator klobuchar.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nklobuchar: donald trump's worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for. and i was going to comment on cuba policy because i actually lead the bill to lift the embargo. i went with barack obama when he went to cuba. and i've seen firsthand how the cuban are way in front of our -- their leaders.\n\nthey like america. they want to be entrepreneurs. and the way that we embrace them, and not the socialist regime, is by opening up cuba and starting to do business with them.\n\nbut to get at what we were just talking about, i just think we have a huge choice. super tuesday states, one-third of america will vote. do you want to have someone...\n\nbrennan: thank you, senator.\n\nklobuchar: ... in charge of this ticket -- could i finish, margaret?\n\nbrennan: well, you're out of time. senator.\n\nklobuchar: you want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the american economy.\n\nbrennan: bill whitaker?\n\nklobuchar: i don't think we do. i think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nbrennan: you have to allow the senator to respond. senator sanders.\n\nbuttigieg: i want to respond to the question that senator sanders...\n\nsanders: can i respond? amy used the word alienating. hey, amy, my favorability nationally i believe are the highest up here, as a matter of fact.\n\n(applause)\n\nsanders: all right. but the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. we need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the united states. we need to bring working people back in to the democratic party. we need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. that is what our campaign is about.\n\n(applause)\n\nbrennan: bill whitaker has the floor.\n\nwhitaker: vice president biden.\n\nbiden: yes.\n\nwhitaker: the bipartisan senate select committee on intelligence report concluded russia interfered in our last presidential election, and the obama administration failed to respond forcefully. u.s. intelligence says russia is at it again. if it is proven that russia has interfered in the 2020 elections, would you, as president, launch a retaliatory cyber attack?\n\nbiden: i would make them pay for it, and i would make them pay for it economically. they are engaged now, as i speak, in interfering in our elections. they were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against hillary, they were. there's no question.\n\nthis man stood before the whole world, turned to the russian leader and said, why in god's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? give me a break. seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. when we got the information, we went to the committee in the senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them.\n\nwe went to mitch mcconnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. he said, no, we want no part of it. and if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. and, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. and so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on russia now for their interference.\n\n(applause)\n\nwhitaker: mr. steyer.\n\nsteyer: look, 21st century warfare is cyber warfare. what we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now. the question you have to ask is, where is the commander-in-chief? and let me say this...\n\nbiden: we don't have one.\n\nsteyer: ... this isn't news, what vice president biden said is true, he did stand next to vladimir putin. there was a hostile, foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power. that's why i started need to impeach.\n\nthat's what we have to do. we have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the united states of america. that's where we are. where are all these patriotic republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? it's outrageous.\n\n(applause)\n\nthat's why he should have been impeached. they covered it up. and i was years before these people. there's something wrong here. we're under attack, and they're not doing a darn thing about it.\n\ngarrett: thank you, mr. steyer.\n\nbuttigieg: look, the way to deter a cyber attack...\n\ngarrett: senator sanders -- no, senator sanders, i have a question for you, sir. you're the frontrunner in this race. you're on the ballot in south carolina. mayor bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second.\n\nif elected, senator sanders, you would be america's first jewish president. you recently called a very prominent, well-known american israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. what would you say to american jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of israel? and specifically, sir, would you move the u.s. embassy back to tel aviv?\n\nsanders: let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration.\n\ngarrett: which would...\n\nsanders: but here -- excuse me. but here is the point. i am very proud of being jewish. i actually lived in israel for some months. but what i happen to believe is that,
denver -- christopher watts, who is charged with killing his family and dumping their bodies at an oil worksite, taped a video presentation six years ago about saving or abandoning relationships. a youtube video posted in april 2012 shows watts giving a powerpoint presentation that he titled, communication speech, relationship deterioration and repair.\n\nhe opened the presentation by saying it is for a course he was taking. he then speaks of infidelity — possibly with someone at work — as a reason that relationships fail.\n\npolice in suburban denver say watts was having an affair with a co-worker before he was arrested last week in the slayings of his wife, shanann watts, and their two young daughters, bella, 3, and celeste, 4. he has not entered a plea to murder and other felony charges.\n\naccording to court documents, watts told police in frederick, a colorado community in the oil and gas fields north of denver, that he told his wife on august 13 that he wanted to separate. a police investigation determined that watts was actively involved in an affair with a co-worker, the documents state.\n\nwatts worked at anadarko petroleum and was fired on august 15, the day he was arrested. he told investigators that he killed his wife but claimed that she had strangled their two daughters after he told her he wanted to separate.\n\nin the 2012 video posted online about six months before the couple wed, watts said he was in suburban broomfield, where the watts family once lived.\n\nsometimes you find your partner no longer attractive physically or in their personality, he said in the presentation. when you are in a relationship you have to show desire, lust toward your partner. sometimes when you get married that the lust and the desire kind of fall by the wayside a little bit.\n\nat another point, watts said: even at the job, you might meet a new person and (it) could strengthen into something else and could weaken the bond you have with the partner you have.\n\nand you feel that you might be better with someone else that you've met, he declared. you think that you can no longer do — that your partner is someone that you can't be with.\n\nkrista henery, a spokeswoman for the weld county district attorney's office, declined comment about the video wednesday. watts' public defender, james merson, did not immediately return a phone message.\n\nwatts in the video cites various experts in recommending steps to strengthen and salvage relationships, including listening attentively, thinking before speaking, and openly expressing support and affection.\n\nsometimes when you have children and your relationship starts to deteriorate a child could help repair it, he said.\n\nhe also listed three questions to ask when a relationship is in jeopardy:\n\ndo i have the desire to keep this relationship going? do i have a moral obligation to stay in this relationship? or is it a necessity for me to stay in this relationship?\n\nas watts ended the presentation, he received a round of applause from two women and two men seated on a sofa across the room. one of the women said, good job.\n\nshanann watts is not seen in the video. under a last name she had from an earlier marriage, shanann king posted a comment to the video that said: great job christopher! good information!\n\nnorth carolina court records show she divorced around 2009, several years before she and christopher watts married.\n\nwatts was charged this week with first-degree murder and other felony counts. shanann's body was discovered in a shallow grave about 40 miles from the family's frederick home, and the two girls' bodies were recovered from nearby oil tanks, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\non tuesday, christopher watts appeared in court for an arraignment. shanann watts' father, frank rzucek sr., cried and shook visibly as district judge marcelo kopcow read the formal charges.\n\nshanann's brother, frank rzucek jr., rubbed his father's shoulders and glared unflinchingly at his brother-in-law. a bailiff stood between them.\n\nwatts, handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, didn't show emotion. he said yes, sir, when the judge asked if he understood the murder and other felony charges against him and the penalties they carry, including the death penalty. prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek death.\n\nwatts waived his right to have a preliminary hearing within 35 days. a judge set a status hearing for november 19.
after reportedly being interrupted several times during a campaign stop in texas, presidential contender pete buttigieg got some support from one of his 2020 challengers: beto o'rourke. the former texas congressman tweeted in support of buttigieg friday night after the south bend, indiana, mayor was interrupted by protesters during a speech at the dallas county democratic party dinner.\n\naccording to cnn reporter dj judd, one demonstrator yelled, repent! and another said, marriage is between a man and a woman!\n\ntexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred, o'rourke wrote friday, tweeting a video of a demonstrator shouting during buttigieg's event.\n\nmayor pete, we are grateful you came to texas and hope to see you and chasten back again soon, o'rourke added.\n\ntexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred. mayor pete, we are grateful you came to texas and hope to see you and chasten back again soon. https://t.co/ihrdtibreb — beto o'rourke (@betoorourke) may 4, 2019\n\nthe message was retweeted more than 4,000 times and had over 30,000 likes by saturday morning, with many followers calling o'rourke classy for reaching out to his competition in a moment of sincerity on the campaign trail.\n\nprotests have become somewhat of a common occurrence at buttigieg's campaign stops. during a two-day swing through iowa last month, buttigieg was interrupted by protesters at two events with iowa democrats, with demonstrators questioning the openly-gay mayor's episcopalian faith.\n\nbuttigieg, meanwhile, has not been shy about addressing his sexuality or his devout faith on the campaign trail. the mayor has called marriage equality a moral issue, and said his marriage of two years to his husband chasten has made him a better human being and moved him closer to god.
south bend, indiana mayor and presidential candidate pete buttigieg opens up about his thoughts on the presidency, his marriage and more, in a wide-ranging interview with john dickerson for cbs sunday morning, to be broadcast april 21.\n\nbuttigieg, 37, is a veteran of the afghanistan war and is one of many vying for the democratic nomination for president. if elected, he would be america's youngest president ever.\n\ndemocratic presidential contender pete buttigieg, the mayor of south bend, ind., with cbs news' john dickerson. cbs news\n\none of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. because the presidency is also a moral office, buttigieg tells dickerson, co-host of cbs this morning. it calls this nation to its highest values. and it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in america understands where they fit in this country's story.\n\nin terms of experience for the job, buttigieg says one of the toughest decisions he's had to make was a moment in afghanistan when he needed to make a split-second decision whether to abandon a vehicle that might be ready to explode and risk being killed, or continue on with his mission.\n\ndickerson visits south bend with buttigieg to see his home, and the city he runs. dickerson also talks with buttigieg's husband, chasten buttigieg, a junior-high schoolteacher.\n\ndo you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in american politics? dickerson asks chasten buttigieg.\n\ni think i'd argue i don't have to answer for it, chasten replies. i mean, we passed marriage equality. i don't think i have to answer for my marriage anymore. but i do enjoy going out there with pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage.\n\nsunday morning, hosted by jane pauley, broadcasts on cbs sundays beginning at 9 a.m. et. executive producer is rand morrison. sunday morning also streams on cbsn beginning at 9:30 a.m. et and repeated at 1 p.m. et, and is available on cbs.com, cbs all access, and on demand. you can also download the free sunday morning audio podcast at itunes and at play.it.\n\nbe sure to follow us at cbssundaymorning.com, and on twitter (@cbssunday), facebook, and instagram (#cbssundaymorning).
jada pinkett smith is revealing secrets from her pre-fame past.\n\nthe girls trip star recently visited the sway in the morning show on siriusxm, where she explained the origins of her friendship with late rapper tupac shakur.\n\nit's kind of hard because i haven't really told the whole story, she said. one of the things that's very interesting that i've never really said before is that when i first met pac, i was a drug dealer.\n\nthat's how we started, she said. then as i was coming out, something very bad happened to me. as i was coming out of the life, he was coming more into the life.\n\npinkett smith also revealed that when shakus was killed in 1996, they hadn't been speaking because of an argument.\n\npac and i's relationship was about survival, she said. that's how it started. i know that most people want to always connect it in this romance thing, and that's just because they don't have the story. it was based in survival -- how we held each other down -- and when you have somebody that has your back when you feel like you're nothing, that's everything. there's a lot of components to our story that we've never shared for a very specific reason. i just decided that this one little piece was important to share finally because it gives more insight to who we were. it was about survival and it's always been about survival between us.\n\nlast month, smith took to twitter to express her frustrations about the shakur biopic, all eyez on me.\n\nforgive me... my relationship to pac is too precious to me for the scenes in all eyez on me to stand as truth. — jada pinkett smith (@jadapsmith) june 16, 2017\n\npac never read me that poem. i didn't know that poem existed until it was printed in his book. — jada pinkett smith (@jadapsmith) june 16, 2017\n\npac never said goodbye to me before leaving for la. he had to leave abruptly and it wasn't to pursue his career. — jada pinkett smith (@jadapsmith) june 16, 2017\n\ni've never been to any of pac's shows by his request. we never had an argument backstage. — jada pinkett smith (@jadapsmith) june 16, 2017
pete buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and donald trump is no longer president. the first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when iowans go to caucus in the first democratic voting contest on february 3.\n\nhe has been hitting the trail hard, reminding iowa caucus goers that it is decision time.\n\nfour presidential contenders — bernie sanders, elizabeth warren, amy klobuchar and michael bennet — will be off the trail for most days over at least the next two weeks because they're sitting senators who are required to be present for president trump's senate impeachment trial. though the trial has not yet begun, their obligations in washington have already meant that buttigieg has had iowa to himself for a couple of days after the presidential debate last week.\n\nin that time, he's been giving some thought to his closing argument, about why i'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat donald trump. he's leaning into moderation, presenting himself as an alternative to progressives bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, who are both polling strongly in iowa. where they focus on ideological purity, he's explaining why i'm focused on bringing together, not just our party but our country when the time comes.\n\nhis stump speech revolves largely around faith, freedom and democracy. he's also consistent about stressing that his campaign aims to build a sense of belonging, and he has a collection of anecdotes about how his campaign has emphasized that idea to its supporters.\n\na campaign aide told cbs news that the former south bend mayor will continue to emphasize his belief in the importance of building a broad coalition. he often mentions his campaign is reaching out to the progressive wing of the democratic party, moderates and future former republicans.\n\nthe latest des moines register/cnn poll showed that buttigieg is third among likely democratic caucus goers behind bernie sanders and elizabeth warren. the poll showed that 40% of democrats in iowa have decided who they will support, compared to 45% who said they can be persuaded to support another candidate.\n\nat multiple campaign stops in iowa, buttigieg has acknowledged iowa has a thumb on the scale in selecting the party's nominee — its winner has been the democratic nominee 7 out of 10 times — but he also talks about how iowa has been a leader in political and social issues that are personal to him.\n\niowa has a way of surprising america and leading it forward — 2008, iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the united states, buttigieg said at a town hall in mason city, of barack obama.\n\nabout a decade ago, iowa led the way in making it possible for a marriage like mine to exist, he noted. iowa has recognized same-sex marriages since 2009.\n\nmaryland congressman anthony brown, who is a national campaign co-chair and the first congressional black caucus (cbc) member to endorse buttigieg, told cbs news in an interview that buttigieg needs to convey his practical solutions to governing, his mayoral record, his military service and his faith in the final weeks to the caucus to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\ni think sharing his experiences, framing it in the values that we all share, demonstrating a strategic approach to our issues — i think that will set him apart from the other candidates, brown added.\n\nbut some undecided voters who attended his events his past week still harbor misgivings about the 38-year-old candidate's experience.\n\ni think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said runal a. patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for new jersey senator cory booker's presidential campaign. i really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' i always think well, look how that presidency is going. you know, i don't think that that's a good answer.\n\nclaire schaefer, a 21-year-old college student whose first choice is minnesota senator amy klobuchar, also seems dubious that he has the experience to lead — or at least remains unconvinced by the argument he sometimes makes that experience doesn't matter so much. on the debate stage, he has argued that the decades of experience of his competitors have led the country nowhere.\n\ni guess in some ways his inexperience like makes me a little doubtful, and that's probably the only thing —and maybe his performance with voters of color, schaefer said.\n\non the ground, national caucus director travis brock is planning to stay in iowa until caucus day. while he usually splits his time between nevada, which also holds a caucus, and iowa, brock recently embarked on a 19-stop tour around the state training volunteers and precinct captains across iowa.\n\nwhile buttigieg held five events last thursday, brock spent nearly two hours training over 250 people in polk county, the largest in the state. it's part of a broader effort to teach volunteers and caucus goers the delegate math and persuasion methods in order to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\nbuttigieg is keenly aware that he'll need a strong finish in iowa in order to build momentum heading into the other nominating contests.\n\nit continues to be the case that iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who i think are very pragmatic in places like south carolina and nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in nevada on january 11.
actress meagan good met her filmmaker husband, devon franklin, on set filming for the movie, jumping the broom.\n\nthe couple is out with a new book called, the wait: a powerful practice for finding love of your life and the life you love, which explains why saving sex for marriage is the key to success. the couple committed to celibacy until they tied the knot in 2012.\n\nfranklin, who is also a preacher, said his decision to remain celibate starting ten years before marriage was inspired by his spiritual practice.\n\ni didn't want to live two lives. at the time i wasn't practicing celibacy, but i was still talking about it, and i said, 'you know, i have to be the man that god called me to be,' and part of that was taking this vow and waiting until marriage and when i stared doing that it gave me discipline that helped me in every other area of my life, franklin told cbs this morning monday.\n\nthe couple said the wait was important because sex can cloud people's judgment when dating.\n\nwhen you take that out of the equation, you actually get to know the person across the board in every other way except the physical which, which comes later, good said.\n\ngood said she decided to take the vow of celibacy after filming jumping the broom because she felt that she had hit rock bottom emotionally and spiritually.\n\nit was in that prayer time that i came to the conclusion that i needed to be celibate, i needed to do something different than what i had been doing all the years before, good said. i decided this is what i need to do for me, because i need to heal and i need to focus on myself and i need to advance myself in every area of my life without the distraction of feeling... that i need this man.\n\nthe couple also drew a distinction between abstinence, and celibacy.\n\nabstinence is just, 'hey i'm not doing it.' and we say, well, sometimes you can be abstinent because you don't have options, good said. but we define celibacy as abstaining from sex because there's a higher purpose and a higher calling and we believe that it is specifically related to marriage.
jason lee is no longer a practicing scientologist.\n\nthe 46-year-old actor and his family moved to denton, texas, last year, and he recently quietly shared the news with local outlet, the dentonite. when asked what businesses he owns in denton, lee took the opportunity to clear up rumors about himself.\n\nif [my wife] ceren and i had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's, lee said. and being that we don't practice scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a scientology center.\n\nquite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he continued. we're not here to buy up or change or take over denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. we're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nlee and wife ceren alkac married in 2008 and have two children together -- 9-year-old casper and 4-year-old sonny. lee also has a son with his ex, beth riesgraf, 12-year-old pilot inspektor.\n\nthe former my name is earl actor had been practicing scientology since the '90s. last june, lee's ex-wife, carmen llywelyn, wrote an essay for the now defunct gawker blaming the controversial religion for their split. lee and llywelyn married in 1995, and divorced in 2001.\n\nwhen i think back, i believe a part of me knew if i didn't accept scientology the marriage would be over before it even started, llywelyn wrote. that may sound somewhat superficial and at that age, maybe it was. but in truth, regardless of how different i feel about jason and scientology today, i was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work. i did what i thought was right.\n\nlee isn't the only celeb who has parted ways with the church of scientology. lisa marie presley left the religion in 2012, as did crash director paul haggis, in 2009.\n\nactress leah remini, who left the church in 2013 after being a member for 36 years, has been the most openly critical of the religion, penning her book,troublemaker: surviving hollywood and scientology, last november. in june, tony ortega, who worked on the hbo documentary going clear, told et the former king of queens star is working on a new show spotlighting scientology and its effects on family life.\n\nthe church has previously denied all of remini's allegations and released a statement claiming that bitterness and anger are common threads in her life.\n\nleah remini knows the truth she conveniently rewrites in her revisionist history, the statement reads in part. the real story is that she desperately tried to remain a scientologist in 2013, knowing full well she was on the verge of being expelled for refusing to abide by the high level of ethics and decency scientologists are expected to maintain.
los angeles -- a federal judge in california ruled thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an american citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the u.s. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. the state department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old ethan dvash-banks because u.s. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, district judge john f. walter found.\n\na lawsuit filed by the boys' parents, andrew and elad dvash-banks, sought the same rights for ethan that his brother, aiden, has as a citizen.\n\neach boy was conceived with donor eggs and the sperm from a different father — one an american, the other an israeli citizen — but born by the same surrogate mother minutes apart.\n\nelad dvash-banks, left, and his partner, andrew, pose for photos with their twin sons, ethan, center right, and aiden in their apartment tuesday, jan. 23, 2018, in los angeles. ap\n\nthe government had only granted citizenship to aiden, who dna tests showed was the biological son of andrew, a u.s. citizen. ethan was conceived from the sperm of elad dvash-banks, an israeli citizen.\n\nthe suit was one of two filed last year by an lgbtq immigrant rights group that said the state department is discriminating against same-sex binational couples by denying their children citizenship at birth. the cases filed in los angeles and washington by immigration equality said the children of a u.s. citizen who marries abroad are entitled to u.s. citizenship at birth no matter where they are born, even if the other parent is a foreigner. only the los angeles case was decided thursday.\n\nthe state department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. previously the department pointed to guidance on its website that said there must be a biological connection to a u.s. citizen to become a citizen at birth.\n\nthis family was shocked and appalled and angry when they were told their family wasn't legal, said aaron morris, executive director of immigration equality. they wanted their twin boys to be treated exactly the same.\n\nmorris said the government wrongly applied a policy for children born out of wedlock to married same-sex couples.\n\nwalter agreed, writing that the state department statute does not contain language requiring a 'blood relationship between the person and the father' in order for citizenship to be acquired at birth.\n\nthis is justice! we are hopeful that no other family will ever have to go through this again. it's like a giant rock has been removed from our hearts, andrew and elad dvash-banks said in a statement provided by immigration equality.\n\nandrew dvash-banks was studying in israel when he met his future husband, elad, an israeli citizen. because they couldn't marry at the time in the u.s. or in israel, they moved to canada, where they wed in 2010. the children were born by a surrogate in september 2016.\n\neverything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the american consulate in toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating.\n\nthe consular official told them she had discretion to require a dna test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship. the men knew that andrew was aiden's biological father and elad was ethan's but they had kept it a secret and hadn't planned on telling anyone.\n\nafter submitting the dna test results that proved who fathered each boy, the couple received a large and small envelope from the u.s. on march 2. the big one included aiden's passport. the other was a letter notifying andrew that ethan's application had been denied.\n\nthe family has since moved to los angeles to be closer to andrew dvash-banks' family.\n\nthe other case involves two women, one from the u.s., and one from italy, who met in new york, wed in london and each gave birth to a son. the state department didn't recognize the couple's marriage, the lawsuit said, and only granted citizenship to the boy whose biological mother was born and raised in the u.s.
atlanta -- georgia lawmakers backed a bill on tuesday preventing businesses from discriminating based on race, nationality, religion or sex, after republicans rejected democrats' efforts to add gay and transgender people to those protected by the measure.\n\nthe change would catch georgia up to federal standards set by the civil rights act of 1964. georgia is one of five states without a so-called public accommodation law.\n\nrep. taylor bennett, a brookhaven democrat, tried to amend the bill to also prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status or disability. but his proposal was altered by rep. beth beskin, an atlanta republican, who eliminated all of bennett's additions except gender.\n\nafter democrats on the committee questioned beskin about whether she intended to excuse discrimination against other groups, beskin said local governments can decide to provide protections beyond the proposed bill. some municipalities, including the city of atlanta, already have such laws.\n\nit was what i could do, she said. and i'm certainly not intending to enlarge any discriminatory actions or rights (of) employers.\n\na number have states have gone beyond the federal law, preventing discrimination based on marital status, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodation laws.\n\nbennett said he was disappointed that the bill is headed toward a floor vote without protecting more people from discrimination but still called it a significant step.\n\nthis is something that should have been done a long time ago, he said.\n\nthe committee also passed a bill known as the pastor protection act, stating that religious officials aren't required to perform same-sex marriages. nothing in state or federal law would require them to perform the ceremonies, but lawmakers said the bill would reassure officials concerned by the u.s. supreme court's recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nhouse speaker david ralston, the chamber's top republican, supports the pastor protection act.\n\ngeorgia lawmakers have filed at least eight bills to grant a variety of legal exemptions to religious opponents of same-sex marriage. the push has gay-rights advocates in georgia on guard; around 200 people held a rally opposing the measures tuesday outside the state capitol.\n\nboth bills approved tuesday now go to the house rules committee, which determines the daily schedule of bills receiving a full vote on the floor. the bills could receive a vote as soon as thursday.\n\njeff graham, executive director of the gay-rights advocacy group georgia equality, said adding more protected groups to the civil rights bill would solve the broader disagreement between those seeking religious exemptions and the lgbt community.\n\nwe can solve this problem this year for everyone, graham said. it's an opportunity for the legislature as a whole to be on the right side of history.
in this episode of intelligence matters, host michael morell speaks with judd devermont, director of the africa program at the center for strategic and international studies and a former senior analyst in the intelligence community. devermont discusses areas of instability on the continent and the areas where the u.s. has an opportunity to pursue national interests. he reviews areas of progress and setbacks in governance and security, and explains why he believes there has been a 'democratization of leadership' in africa. devermont also reviews chinese and russian investments and operations on the continent, and explains why they each have significant long-term implications for u.s. security.\n\n\n\ndownload, rate and subscribe here: itunes, spotify and

intelligence matters.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthank you for having me.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso maybe the place to start is a little bit about your career. and i'd be interested in a couple things. one is, your interest in africa, where did that come from? and then, your interest in c.i.a. and where did that come from and how did you end up there?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyou mean why did someone who grew up in southern california end up spending a career working in africa?\n\nmichael morell:\n\n(laugh) exactly, exactly.\n\njudd devermont:\n\ni love history and in high school, all you can take is u.s. and european. and when i got to college, i just went all over the world: latin america and southeast asia, east asia. but i took a class on the arab revolt, actually, and this seminar class was so incredible, the way in which they talked about how arab nationalism and agency mixed with geo politics.\n\nand so, i kind of knew that's what i wanted, but i still didn't know what the region was. i didn't really want to go in the middle east. and one day, i didn't go to class, i never miss class, but one day i decided with a friend, we walked around campus and we got in front of a study abroad kiosk.\n\nand only two pamphlets jumped at me: ghana and south africa. and i don't know, michael, it was this moment where i could see my entire future. i knew all of those things that i liked in that arab spring course or arab revolt course were going to be in africa. i moved to south africa, i did a year there and i never looked back.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand what was that year in south africa like?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nit was incredible. i studied at the university of cape town. i traveled all over southern africa. i lived in the dorms and have great south african friends. and i just found on the continent, history, i had a professor who said, history lies heavy on the continent's present and future. and so, it was everything that i wanted and it's been incredibly fulfilling, 20 years now.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah, for those listeners who haven't been to cape town, i've been there twice, you are just absolutely surrounded by history.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, it's gorgeous.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nit is amazing. and then the c.i.a., how did you end up at the c.i.a.?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthis is kind of a funny story. it actually has a lot to do with a tom clancy novel, but not because i related to jack ryan. i mean, yeah, he's an analyst, but the guy is on operation almost immediately, right?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright, right.\n\njudd devermont:\n\ni mean, he's never at his desk. and so, i wanted, as i said, a job, i love history, i wanted a job that had a lot to do with history. and in this one jack ryan novel, he's not even in the agency anymore, he's like the national security advisor. and he calls up the department of state to talk to their senior desk officer for japan.\n\nand the way i remembered this passage, i tried to find it recently and i can't, the senior desk officer in japan knows everything about history, politics, culture, economics. and i said, i'm going to be a desk officer. that's my goal. applied for the state department as an intern, i got in. i was going to be in the bureau of west african affairs and just before i left for washington, my father grabs the intern guide book that i had and says, c.i.a. you should apply to c.i.a. i said, listen, pops--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhy did he say that?\n\njudd devermont:\n\ni think he loves the operation. he continues to tell me he could be a great operational officer. he's 77 years old. but he was really fascinated with the lifestyle and he encouraged me to apply. i said, i'm going to be a desk officer, i don't need this. he said, you should apply. so i did. i get to washington. first day at the department of state, it's like two hours of paperwork, they say, come back tomorrow for your first full day. it's september 11th, 2011.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwow.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthat was my first day working for the u.s. government.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwow.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nand i know where you were and i know you were briefing the president and i was just an intern in west africa, but i felt a sense of privilege that i was there. it was a great experience. and a couple of weeks later the c.i.a. calls and said, we'd like to offer you a grad fellowship.\n\nso now i'm at a place where c.i.a. seems really interesting, my fantasy desk officer job seems really interesting, i'm very lucky to sort of go to cote d'ivoire, work in our embassy for a longer internship and i meet an analyst from inr, state department's analytic wing. she's retired now, but she was phenomenal.\n\ni mean, she wasn't even the senior analyst for this country and she had everyone in the palm of her hands. and that was the moment that i said, i know exactly where i want to go. it's going to\n\nbe an analyst.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah. so in laymen's terms, can you tell folks what it's like to be an analyst at c.i.a.?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. you know, there wasn't a day that i didn't have a smile on my face walking in that door. i came in on the weekends and not because i had a task there, but because i had a paper that i really wanted to write, research. but every day you are immersed in all this information about the country or issue that you work.\n\nyou have these great colleagues that you are engaging with. every morning, there's a 9:00 morning meeting and you sort of report up what's interesting, what's happened, what should we be writing about, what do senior policy makers need to know. and then, you spend your day writing those papers or going to briefings or spending time around a table and trying to figure out what's going to happen next and why does it matter.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso you become the national intelligence officer for africa, what does that mean? what does a national intelligence officer do?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nit's the best job i've ever had, michael. it really has three functions. you are the u.s. government's senior analyst on a country or an issue. you represent all the 17 intelligence agencies, in all policy meetings. c.i.a. might have a seat at the table, but i represented the dni. and i would do the briefing that usually kicked off these policy meetings. so that was sort of one of the responsibilities.\n\nthe second is that i oversaw all of the strategic analysis that the intelligence community had, national intelligence estimates, et cetera. c.i.a. might have their view, dia may have their view, but what was written under my auspices was a community view.\n\nand sometimes the community may disagree and we would represent that, as well. and then the third part of the job which i really loved which is i felt responsible for helping to develop our analytic cadre. i would host conferences, i would bring people together, i used to have a product of the month that i would send out, so people could see analytic excellence.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthat's great.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nit was a fantastic job. three years, great.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand you also served on the nsc staff on africa.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyes.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ntalk about that.\n\njudd devermont:\n\ni worked in the obama administration, i was the director for nigeria, somalia, the sahel and the african union. these countries aren't next to each other, but my boss just said, all of your\n\nexperiences, we're just going to put them into one account.\n\nand my job was to coordinate u.s. policy. it was a pretty interesting time. we ended up recognizing the government of somalia for the first time since 1991. i contributed to the obama strategy towards africa. and my job was really to make sure that we were all marching in the same direction. i wrote all the papers for the deputy's committees and other senior meetings so that we could figure out where we're going to go.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso how many countries are in sub saharan africa?\n\njudd devermont:\n\n49.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso how is it possible to keep up with what's going on in 49 countries?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyou know, when i was telling you the story about why i joined, what i wanted to be, it was to be an expert. and i think it's taken me to this point in my career to realize i may never be an expert on 49 countries. so you do a lot of triaging, you work with a lot of smart people. but i find each and every one of them fascinating.\n\nand i've had the fortune of working first in west african issues and then i moved to east african and central african, so i've sort of moved around enough, and then my academic work was on southern. but you have to go into these meetings and present to policy makers real insights into these countries that they may have worked and traveled to together. so it's a lifelong challenge.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand this is a big place, right?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthe continent is huge.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, i have a map next to me right now.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah, yeah.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nbecause i have to reference it.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand just the congo itself is roughly the size of half the united states, right?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyes, right, yeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nit's a massive continent.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nmassive continent.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso this great job that you had in the intelligence community you left in 2018?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhy?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nwell, i always think it's important to say it has nothing to do with politics. i spent 18 months as the national intelligence officer under president obama and then 18 months under president trump, and i actually really liked working and trying to support this administration. it forced me to challenge my assumptions.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso you were the national intelligence officer during the trump [administration]?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyes, for 18 months.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nokay.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nand i had to meet them where they were, which they didn't have the kind of depth that president obama and his team had on africa and they had different views and i really enjoyed trying to find ways to communicate the continent's significance and why it matters.\n\nbut the nio job was the pinnacle for me. that's the best job you can have in my career of service. i thought maybe in 30 years i would be able to get to that point, and i was about halfway through in my career and i didn't see a job in the community that would sort of push me forward. i wanted a new challenge.\n\nand quite honestly, i wanted to do policy again. i really liked being at the nsc, and i wanted to think about what our policy should be. and you know, one of the things you can't do as an analyst is give policy prescriptive.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nso it just seemed like a time to leave at a high point at this incredible position to engage with new people and think about where we should go next.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand as csis, you are able to do both the analysis and policies, right?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. it's actually a lot like my old job. i read a lot, i write a lot, but then i have recommendations on what i think we should do. plus, i get to do things, like i have a podcast, that's fun. i talk to journalists.\n\nmichael morell:\n\npodcasts are the best. (laugh)\n\njudd devermont:\n\npodcasts are the best. you know, i travel a lot. i meet with african and european and other government officials and get to interact with them in a different way, speaking for myself, not for my government.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso intelligence matters has now been around for a couple of years, we have never had anybody on talking about africa. so i think the key question is: how does africa matter to our national security? and how much does it matter?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nhow do you answer that question?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthis is a difficult question because as we've just talked about, there are 49 countries in sub saharan africa, 54, if you include the north african countries. 55 if you're the african union because you include western sahara. and as our interests evolved, the way we look at africa changes. and if you would just allow me a quick tangent, because this is very nerdy, but if it's going to be successful, it's going to be successful on intelligence matters.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwell, you're talking to a nerd, so we're in good shape here.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyes. i teach a class at george washington university on the history of u.s. intelligence analysis in africa, and i found this piece, a national intelligence estimate from 1971 in east africa, and there's a line in it, maybe you've seen this before, i've never seen it before, the analyst said, the significance for the united states of developments in east africa depends on what the u.s. says is important.\n\nright? it sounds circular, but it's true. and then, the analysts go further than that, right? they say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in east africa. there's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment.\n\nbut if you step back, and i'm paraphrasing here, if you step back, these are countries that could be models, open societies. these leaders have influence, both in africa and globally. and if they should go south, if there should be instability, it would affect our interests.\n\nand i like to use that story because it tells me don't undersell and don't oversell. look at all the angles and present all the arguments. so the way that i think about africa right now is in three ways: first, the future is african, demographically. the continent will double in size. it will go from 1.2 billion people to 2.4 billion people by 2050. that means a quarter of the world's population will be africa. nigeria is going to be larger than the united states.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso fastest growth by any continent?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, fastest growth, youngest continent. nigeria is going to be the third-largest country in the world, it's going to surpass us. and so, every global problem is going to have an african dimension to it. what is going to be the norms around internet privacy? how are we going to deal with climate change?\n\nthere's going to be an african component to that and we need to be mindful of that. two, and this has been something that i've learned in my career, africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. what happens in africa changes the way the world works. african migration crisis changed european politics. the ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. you may remember the piracy off the coast of the horn of africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright, right.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nso i think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. and then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and i think they understand it probably better than we do.\n\nwe are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub saharan africa. trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. and military bases all across africa. indian ocean, the horn of africa and western saharan, i'm sorry, western africa.\n\nso i think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso talk a little bit about kind of the state of africa today. you know, what's going on there? what are the challenges these countries face? and what are some of the positive things that are happening?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nchinua achebe, the author of things fall apart, said when talking about nigeria, the problem with nigeria is leadership. and i think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. there is instability.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nit's true. it's true of a lot of countries.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nit's true of a lot of the countries, right? but you know, instability in the sahel, challenges in eastern congo with ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. and i would argue right now, those things are really coming together.\n\ngovernance has been hard in africa, but it's become really complex. and i think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. and i think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and i think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. and these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us.\n\nbut there's some good news stories. and i always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the u.s. media on africa, it's all negative. i mean, it's disproportionately negative. and\n\nafrica is doing some things that are really interesting.\n\nthey're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. so while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of africans support democratic principles.\n\nin some countries, it's like in the 80s. there's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. that's historic. while the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, africans have created a new continental trade arrangements.\n\nit's the largest trading block since the w2o was founded. and finally, while the rest of the world or at least the united states are thinking about pulling out, the africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. so i think those are really good stories.\n\nand just the last thing that i think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is african soft power. africa, africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that i think are unprecedented. our music, our films, our sports, africans are shaping it at the lead.\n\nand i'd love to see african governments take advantage of their soft power and i'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhy is that happening?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nwell, let me start with trade first. for the africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. no one's going to invest in the small little gambia, which just covers the river within senegal. inter trade within africa has been historically low.\n\nand the africans under the leadership of paul kagame, president of rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-african trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers.\n\nso i think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. on the democracy side, i think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. first, as i said, still strong support for democracy, but i think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in africa. as it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones.\n\nwe're seeing more protests on the streets. we're seeing more people push for change. and so, whether it's the uprising in sudan that ended president al bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, i think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub saharan africa.\n\nbecause you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. but if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. and what i tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. and i expect a lot of volatility.\n\nwe'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. but i think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. and so, it's a really interesting time right now.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nare there countries, and i'm thinking of south africa, i'm thinking of nigeria, i'm thinking of kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? or is that not a right way of thinking about it?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nu.s. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: nigeria, south africa, kenya and ethiopia. they have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. i don't think that is as true as much anymore. nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems.\n\ntheir president isn't the most dynamic. ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; south africa is way down by economic problems. and so, what i think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in africa. different countries step up at different times.\n\nso there's not one single voice. you can't as you did under the bush administration or under the obama administration say, well, nigeria is going to carry our water in west africa. it just doesn't happen anymore. you've got to, i think, build these coalitions with the senegals and the ghanas in some regions and still rely on south africa and kenya for other things.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou, judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in africa.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. so can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely china and russia, are doing on the continent? and if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. let me start with china. i think it's really important to say that china poses some threats to the u.s. in what it's doing. but i've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to china.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwith china?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nwith china. we seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub saharan africa. and i don't know, it's like mad libs right now. it's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of china. and i don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand it's that because of china that is the driver, right?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, it's the because of china. and i think that if we are going to be effective at managing what china is doing in sub saharan africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. so i would say, first of all, it's chinese investment in critical infrastructure. ports. we just did a paper at csis, 46 ports the chinese are invested in, operating or building in africa.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand that's a risk because--?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthat's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand the chinese port could eventually become a chinese military base?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nabsolutely. that's what we saw in djibouti.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nso i worry about ports. i worry about cyber and telecoms. the chinese have built about 70% of africa's 4g, it will be 100% of their 5g. even satellites, africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the chinese are behind it. so we should focus on that.\n\nwe should focus on the people-to-people investment that china is doing. they're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. more african students study in china than they do in the united states. china has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages.\n\ni think that's decadal, the impacts of that. but the thing about china that gets the most oxygen in washington is economics. and here is where i think we need to be a lot more nuanced. china is addressing the needs of africans. this is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world.\n\nthey need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the african development bank, and china is doing a lot of that stuff. so what we need to do with china in my view is we can't tell africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nchina does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. but we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the u.s. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. so that's how i think about china.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso russia.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, russia is an easier conversation that china, right? i don't need much nuance. there is very few upsides to what russia is doing. essentially, president putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.\n\nafrica is a place where he can work asymmetrically. they don't do much that helps african economies. they sell arms. they're the largest exporter of arms to africa in the world. they are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. but often, that comes with a side of corruption. what they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics.\n\nif they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help al bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. so they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the soviet union in africa.\n\nand i think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. they're not. and i think when we call them a great power in africa, we do putin's bidding. they're a minnow. at least compared to us, the chinese and europe.\n\nso i think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating russia. we need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. and we need to be better about gauging africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nare there big european players?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, france is still very involved. and in fact, president macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the sahel. the u.k., the week of this recording, just had its first u.k. africa investment summit. malta, i don't know why i'm sharing this, but malta just came out with their own africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.\n\nthe other region that i should spend just a second talking about is the gulf. the gulf is very active in africa and turkey is very active in africa. in some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. dp ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.\n\nbut what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the uae on one side and qatar on the other side. turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. they are doing some security assistance. as i said, it's a crowded space.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso extremist, jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nis that right? and if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to europe, to us?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. we have to remember that al-qaeda's major attack was in africa, right, against our embassies in tanzania, in kenya. but in the last couple decades, i think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly.\n\nthere are al-qaeda and isis affiliates in west and east africa and southern africa. we are seeing unaligned extremist groups like boko haram. the number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and i think the lethality of them are increasing.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nprimarily against local targets?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nprimarily against local targets. so in nigeria, for example, according to a council on foreign relations database, 35,000 have died from boko haram in isis west africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the nigerian military. in the sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people.\n\nso it's primarily african targets. but i just testified in front of the house, and what i said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the u.s. directly, but i think it has some significant impacts for us. first of all, it endangers our citizens that live in africa and our economic investments. there was an attack by al-shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a kenya military base, where the u.s. trains kenyans and an american service person died and two contractors.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nthey tried to attack our base in somalia, as well. and americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. there is a group affiliated with isis right near a huge l&g find in mozambique. so it does threaten our interests about the people who live in africa, our facilities and our economic investments.\n\nit also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. so i think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. and the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, i think we lose the trust of our partners.\n\ni mean, macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the u.s. wasn't there helping. our african partners have said the same. and russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. so it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhat's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah, i think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. and i think the affiliates, al-qaeda and isis have been sort of shopping for partners. i try to be very careful about talking about isis and aq as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. it's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with al-qaeda and isis as it is vice versa.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyes, yes, yeah. they take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. but i think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, ieds and other things.\n\nso i think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. there is a study by undp that looked at sort of extremists in africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces.\n\nso many of these african militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. so those are a couple of the things that i would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. you talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in africa?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. oh, sorry, i thought you were going to go in a different direction. i thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. on the democracy and the governance, i don't have the numbers. but my experience says that it depends, right? i mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright, right, right.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nbut in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (unintel) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. so you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the president and the ruling party?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso judd, i think this is a good place to switch to u.s. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. u.s. policy toward the region. how would you characterize it? what's working? what's not? if\n\nyou could advise the president, what would you tell him?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nyeah. you know, i think that our policy makers on africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. and it's taken them a while to i think figure out how they are going to push policy. and i want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but i've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit.\n\nlike in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on africa for a long time in washington or in the field. and so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. and so, you've got a lot of contractions. and then you had tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright, right, right.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nand then president trump's national security advisor, john bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about russia and china. the africans felt like they were not part of the strategy.\n\nbut in the last year, i've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. they launched an economic initiative called prosper africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? it's addressing some of the challenges that the u.s. private sectors had in investing in africa. they've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches.\n\nbut sanctions now on election spoilers in nigeria, on corrupt officials in kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in south sudan. so those are positive. the big question in year four is: where is the dod going? and you may know there is a proposal in front of secretary of defense esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in africa, about 6,000 people. they already had reduced west african forces about 10%. i think this is a really dangerous policy. i think it's reckless.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nlocal forces, yeah. and it's not just sort of the ct side of the house, they're building capacity for africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of african governments. and we are there in partnership with our european friends.\n\nand this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. we have done this before and it wasn't very good. so you may know, michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in africa. and then after 9/11 and the growing ct threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. so reset those relationships.\n\nrebuild capacity. reinvest in infrastructure. a lack of dod presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. our\n\ndiplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places.\n\ni think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in africa if there is less u.s. presence in these places. so i'm really concerned. i'm elated that the hill has stepped up. senator graham, senator coons, a number of people on the house side have said this is a bad idea. and hopefully, secretary esper will decide not to do this.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah. and if we're not there, who fills the vacuum?\n\njudd devermont:\n\nright, exactly. our adversaries.\n\nmichael morell:\n\njudd, thank you so much for joining us.\n\njudd devermont:\n\nmy pleasure. thank you.\n\n* * *end of transcript* * *
produced by chuck stevenson, lucy scott and asena basak\n\n[this story originally aired on feb. 7, 2015. it was updated on april 2, 2016.]\n\nit's just about a 45-minute drive from the refineries of the texas coast to the high rises of downtown houston. and in 2000, 20-year-old michelle warner moved to the big city. she was a new mom looking to make a fresh start.\n\nmichelle did have the small-town girl in her, but michelle always desired to go to the big city, michelle's mom, donna malone, said. she loved to talk to people... she never met a stranger.\n\nwe were really, really close when we were young kids, i mean really close, her brother, david chaffin added. from the time we were born we did pretty much everything together ... from the time i was born i was her child, not theirs.\n\nmichelle warner donna malone\n\n\n\n\n\nshe just grew into this beautiful swan ... she had the long pretty hair and a beautiful smile, malone continued. ...she started going to college ... and started studying criminal justice.\n\nbut things didn't exactly work out. michelle may have been a saint, but she was also a sinner.\n\nshe married right after high school and, in 2001, and had a daughter, hayley.\n\nwhen that marriage went south in 2003, little hayley went to live with the ex-husband and michelle was on her own.\n\nmichelle was a great mom, malone explained, but she ran into some tough times in her life.\n\nshe fell in with a bad crowd and she even disappeared a couple of times. and she was arrested for possession of cocaine.\n\nbut that was eight years ago. her family says michelle's dark days were behind her.\n\nshe was finally turning around ... she was no longer on any kind of drugs, malone said. she was going to work every day.\n\nin 2008, she also began a relationship with a man she met at work -- a man named mark castellano.\n\nmy impression of mark from the very beginning was, 'what an odd duck, what a strange little man,' said malone.\n\nmichelle warner and mark castellano donna malone\n\n\n\n\n\nmark castellano and michelle warner had met on the job. she was a secretary at a medical firm; he was the it guy -- the person who fixed computers.\n\ni absolutely do not know what michelle saw in mark, said malone.\n\nhe's always been a little off, said chaffin.\n\nin 2009, michelle and mark had a son, cayden.\n\nmichelle was very excited when cayden was born, malone said. i did have some reservations about cayden's dad. ...not so sure about mark at all, no.\n\nmalone says castellano wasn't much of a dad.\n\ncayden was about 2 months old and mark just went away. just, ' ugh, i can't handle this; it's too stressful for me.' everything was always about me - me, me, me, me, me.\n\nin those early days, life was tough for michelle as a single mom bouncing from job to job.\n\nno child support, he did not pay any child support. michelle was doing it on her own -- struggling to do it on her own. it was very difficult for her, said malone.\n\nthen, in the summer of 2012, michelle got a break -- a new job at a law firm in houston. all she needed was a place for her and cayden, now 3 years old, to stay. she reached out to the one person she knew there: mark castellano.\n\nhe agreed to let them stay at his houston apartment, but michelle set down some rules.\n\nwhen michelle moved back in with mark ... the agreement between them was that they would live together, raise the child together, but not as a romantically involved couple, said malone.\n\nbut just three months after moving in with castellano -- on saturday, sept 22, 2012 --michelle was gone.\n\nwhen chaffin couldn't get a hold of his sister, he called castellano and confronted him.\n\ndo you have any idea where she may be? i've exhausted every lead that i have about michelle and i can't find a f-----g thing, anybody who knows anything about where she might be. and you're the last person i know of that's seen her, chaffin asked castellano.\n\nyeah, yeah, i am, i am. but like i said, i don't know where the hell she went, castellano replied.\n\ncastellano told chaffin that he and michelle had had a fight. she'd walked out and left her car and her toddler behind.\n\nchaffin was surprised to learn that on the night his sister disappeared, castellano took michelle's car and drove cayden more than 500 miles -- over eight hours -- to his parent's house in west texas.\n\nmark's story did not make any sense, said malone.\n\nhouston police department\n\n\n\n\n\nalmost immediately, michelle's family filed a missing persons report. they heard nothing. five days later, veteran houston homicide detective fil waters and sergeant brian harris got the case.\n\nwhen you first came here, you went in and what'd you do? 48 hours correspondent tracy smith asked the investigators of the apartment where castellano and michelle lived together.\n\nwent to the apartment, the family was there, det. waters said. actually, it was interesting that mark's story was what happened, you know, i mean in terms of the story that he was telling everyone.\n\ncastellano had told chaffin in that phone call that he and michelle had been arguing over cayden when she walked out.\n\nall of the events leading up to it, the fight, all the stuff that happened here, smith noted.\n\naccurate, at least what he is telling us waters said. the only people in the scenario who were casting any kind of suspicion on mark are michelle's family, that's where all that's coming from. and they're not saying things like, 'you know what? michelle told me yesterday that if anything ever happened to me it's mark.'\n\nwe were getting, 'we don't like mark ... marks a bad guy,' waters continued. it's more personality dislikes about mark.\n\nbut back at the apartment, cops did find something strange.\n\nwe knew that mark was an it guy. he's a techie nerd, waters said. so then, what becomes noticeable in the apartment ... there are computers ... but all the hard drives are gone.\n\nthe homicide detectives wanted to talk with castellano, so they called him at his parent's house in west texas. it turns out castellano had an unusual question for them.\n\nhe said, 'can i ask you a question, though? i need some advice.' and i said, 'sure.' and he said, 'do you think i ought to let dr phil interview me?' said waters.\n\nwhat'd you say? smith asked.\n\nwell, i was a little stunned - i said, 'dr. phil?' waters said of the host of the top-rated daytime talk show. and i said, 'absolutely, let dr. phil interview you.'\n\nas the week passed, the search for michelle warner expanded quickly from houston, to west texas and all the way to los angeles and the dr. phil show.\n\ndr. phil: today we will take you inside a national news story as it unfolded in front of our cameras in real time.\n\nit was dr. phil mcgraw -- not the police - who would first interrogate castellano about michelle's mysterious disappearance:\n\ndr. phil: let's talk about the night she disappeared. you had a fight? was this a physical fight? or an argument? or both? mark castellano: basically, i come home. umm, she's in her room. first thing she does is start yelling at me. cayden has made a big mess ... and we start fighting ... she walks up to me and gives me this kind of sucker punch while i'm on the floor. i mean she hits me all the time and i don't retaliate. she hit me and said, and clean it up right expletive, expletive, and she goes in and slams her door.\n\nwhat was your first impression of him? smith asked.\n\nthat he was a game player, my first impression of him was that he thought he was the smartest guy in the room and he wanted everybody to know it, mcgraw replied.\n\ndr. phil: so you say she goes in, slams the door ... but you go back in to resume the argument, frankly. mark castellano: right, yes. dr. phil: and... mark castellano: she's gone dr. phil: she's gone.\n\ni would take her pictures out and say out loud, 'michelle where are you? you know just call me, text me please,' said malone.\n\ncracking castellano\n\nfrom the very beginning, dr. phil mcgraw felt there was something suspicious about mark castellano.\n\nwhy do you think mark castellano wanted to come on your show? tracy smith asked mcgraw, whose show is distributed by cbs television distribution.\n\ni think this guy is a narcissist. i mean i really do, he replied.\n\nmark castellano to dr. phil: she basically owns me in a lot of way and i admit that. i caved to michelle nine-tenths of the time.\n\ncastellano was on the defensive.\n\nhe said to you, 'she could have just disappeared again,' smith commented to mcgraw. that was a possibility.\n\nright, mcgraw replied. he says it was a possibility ... she could have gone in the bedroom, locked the door, gone out the door and left. but, her car's still there.\n\nand her son is still there, smith noted.\n\nher son is still there, her car is still there, but she's gone off the grid, said mcgraw.\n\nmeantime, in houston -- 500 miles to the east -- the cops were searching the grid trying to find michelle.\n\nwe do something called a psychological autopsy. we start breaking down a person's life, and so that's what we were having to do with michelle, sgt. harris explained.\n\nback in west texas, mcgraw continued his interview with castellano. he had a hunch that those missing hard drives might be connected to michelle's disappearance, so he grilled mark:\n\ndr. phil: you said you would show 'em to me. do you have 'em here? can we look at 'em? mark castellano[gets up from his seat]: yeah i'll bring 'em to you, one second. oh, no i don't have 'em -- he's still copying 'em. dr. phil: ok. you can come back. mark castellano: sorry, i thought he brought them back but he didn't. dr. phil: you said you were gonna show those to us and you got up and walked to the door -- and then said, oh, that's right, they're not here. but not 15 minutes before we got here, you told my producer they weren't here. you already knew they weren't here when you got up to get 'em. mark castellano: my mind is scatterbrained right now. i mean i forgot.\n\ni forgot? said smith.\n\nbells are going off right now. i'm talking to him and watching ... the theatre of what's going on, mcgraw said. he's playing games here. to him, it's a manipulation ... and i'm wondering why he's not putting all of his effort, all of his emphasis, on finding michelle?\n\nmy dad used to say for every rat you see there's 50 you don't. when he tells you that lie, there's 50 more, mcgraw continued.\n\nmcgraw relentlessly peeled back castellano's story.\n\nhe also admits throwing her cat down the hallway, throwing her cat into a wall. and that is very troubling to me, said mcgraw.\n\neach revelation led him closer to the conclusion that castellano killed michelle:\n\ndr. phil: was there violence at this point? mark castellano: there was violence ... she and i would wrestle ... push each other around. there was one time i choked her.\n\nhe admits to being violent with her, said smith.\n\nhe admits to being violent with her to the point of choking her. now think about this: if he, in fact, is culpable in her disappearance, why in the world would he admit that? said mcgraw.\n\nmark castellano during his interview on dr. phil\n\nso let's look at the moment when you asked him the big question, smith said as she and mcgraw watched more of the tv interview:\n\ndr. phil: it's really odd for a mother to just not check on, find out anything about a child. if you think something has happened to her, why aren't you looking for her? mark castellano: i mean, as far as everybody has exhausted the leads that i have. i don't know where else to go. the police are looking for her. they're professionals. dr. phil: did you do anything to her that would be considered foul play or criminal? mark castellano: no, no. dr. phil: did you kill her? mark castellano: no, sir.\n\nso as you left, where did you stand with mark castellano? what did you think? smith asked mcgraw.\n\nit is clear in my mind that i'm not believing a word he is saying, he replied. when i walked out the door ... i said, 'he killed her, no doubt about it.'\n\nyou said it then? smith asked.\n\nhe killed her, said mcgraw.\n\nbut castellano hadn't confessed to anything. after mcgraw returned to los angeles to get his show ready for broadcast, detectives brought castellano in and turned up the heat.\n\nit all happened in an interview room at the houston homicide division. there was no tough guy posturing, no rolled up shirtsleeves or guns on the hip, and no raised voices -- it was pure psychology.\n\ni was like, fil, when you go in there, it's like walking into a minefield, because one, you don't wanna upset him and make him angry where all of sudden he says the l word - lawyer, or he says, i wanna leave, said sgt. harris.\n\ndetective fil waters takes the lead:\n\ndet. waters: ok, so the first thing, you're not under arrest. mark castellano: right. det. waters: again, i told ya i certainly appreciate you coming here and talking to us, spending a lot of time here. mark castellano: well i want michelle to be found.\n\ni want michelle to be found. that's what castellano just said. that's his story and he's sticking to it:\n\ndet. waters: have you tried to call her? mark castellano: at this point? no, i don't want to call her.\n\nthis was it. this was it, waters told smith. we had no evidence, we had nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nso, detective waters started looking for motive. if castellano was a killer, did something push him over the edge?\n\ndet. waters: pressure's building? mark castellano: the pressure's building on me, yes. when she gets mad, she's violent. she'll hit you, she thinks she has the right to ... you know, the man has to take up crap. she's a pretty girl and she gets everything she wants. she has that princess attitude.\n\nthat princess attitude phrase was a flag for detectives -- an insight into how castellano viewed the relationship:\n\ndet. waters: we kind of get a flavor of your relationship. and this is my impression -- is that when it's good, it's like intensely good. but when it is bad, it is intensely bad. mark castellano: right.\n\ndetective waters' approach? no tough questions - yet. he is trying to get castellano to trust him:\n\ndet. waters: let's get to last saturday, the 22nd. mark castellano: ok, she walks out and slams the door to her room ... and about, 10, 15 minutes later i open the door to say, well, you know what and she's gone.\n\nshe's gone.\n\nonce that narrative was complete, and he felt like he had told his story, it was at that point that - i'm now gonna confront you, waters told smith.\n\nthis is a dance, waters continued. and i'm letting mark play the music. and then at one point, another song comes on and it's mine, and now the dance changes.\n\nwaters tells castellano: i need you to explain to me what happened. ... we both know, we both know, michelle did not walk out of that apartment.\n\nthe confession\n\ndetective fil waters sat for hours talking to mark castellano, gaining his trust:\n\nmark castellano: i don't love her. i'm not in love her. i don't want anything to happen to her. i wish michelle would pop up right now. when she gets mad she's violent i don't care what anybody she says, she is. i said something about you take too many pills, you can't watch cayden or something. she's like, i can't tolerate cayden. she's like, i need help with him. she's like, he's driving me nuts.\n\nwaters finally discovered a way to bring out the truth about what happened that night: he brought up cayden.\n\ndet. waters: so your concern for cayden is mainly centered on when michelle is the primary - caregiver. mark castellano: right.\n\ncayden was the most important part of his life, waters told smith, so i knew that i was going to have to frame whatever he did in that apartment in that context.\n\nthat context -- getting castellano to admit his actions that night were to protect cayden:\n\ndet. waters: it wasn't about hurting michelle. it was about the love and the strength of that love that you have for cayden and protecting him from anybody that would threaten to hurt him. and that's what you're gonna have to explain now.\n\nthe strategy worked.\n\ndet. waters: so i want you to be honest with me and tell me what happened.\n\nwhen he took off his glasses, i went -- here it comes, waters told smith. i just knew it.\n\nmark castellano: she's getting dressed. and she's finishing up and she's still yelling and cayden's hiding. i grabbed her and i broke her neck.\n\nboom. there he comes with it, waters told smith.\n\nmark castellano [in tears]: i'm sorry, i'm sorry. f-----g give me the death penalty, that's fine. i deserve it. det. waters: mark, mark look, i'm proud of you. mark castellano: my life's over with anyway. det. waters: your life's not over with, mark.\n\nsergeant harris came into the room and castellano physically demonstrated how he killed michelle:\n\nmark castellano: then i grab her, and then at about that i'm facing the bed and then i fall on top of her and crush her windpipe.\n\ncastellano demonstrated several times how he strangled michelle warner, even pushing sgt. harris onto the tabletop to show how he spent one-and-a-half to two minutes choking her.\n\nmark castellano demonstrates what happened the night michelle warner died. houston police department\n\n\n\n\n\ncastellano claimed michelle's erratic and abusive behavior pushed him over the edge.\n\nmark castellano: she'll hit you; she thinks she has the right to.\n\nhe painted this picture of michelle as an abusive woman, smith said. when you talk to other people did they say that she was volatile? she had a temper? she was abusive?\n\neveryone we talked to, not just family members, described her as a loving mother, said harris.\n\nwas there any evidence that michelle was abusive to mark?\n\nnot anything that was documented ... other than marks story, waters replied.\n\nafter his confession, castellano is left alone with his phone. instead of calling a lawyer, he called his parents: hey mom. well, i confessed. i did it.\n\nhe called his brother: i'm sorry for all he façade i put up for a week, but i can't take the guilt anymore.\n\nhe called a friend: and i wanted you to know that she's dead.\n\nhe even talked with dr. phil's producer: it was a moment of rage, i just - i couldn't take it anymore.\n\nmark castellano to det. waters: i pretty much confessed to everybody i could think of.\n\ncastellano had also told detective waters what happened moments after he killed michelle -- as he stood over her body, lying on the bed.\n\nhe said that cayden walked in and said, 'what's wrong with mommy?' waters said. and he turned around and his response was, 'mommy's taking a nap.'\n\ncastellano put cayden in a bath, and then dragged michelle's body into the closet.\n\nsoon after, he loaded cayden into michelle's car and drove through the night, over 500 miles, to west texas.\n\nhe left cayden with his parents, turned around and drove all the way back to houston -- back to the apartment where he had left michelle.\n\nhow did he get her out of the building? smith asked waters.\n\nhe packaged her up in a large container, plastic container, and duct taped her hands and feet, put a bag over her head, he replied. he explained he put a bag over her head 'cause he was tired of looking at her.\n\nwith the container loaded in the backseat of michelle's car, castellano once again made that long drive back to west texas. outside of midland, he buried michelle in a shallow grave.\n\nit turned out michelle's body was somewhere out in the endless west texas oil fields. castellano had drawn a map and given police a rough idea of where the grave was. but it wasn't a good enough description. the key to finding michelle's body was as close as an iphone.\n\nharris and walters stayed in houston with castellano, while local police and fbi agents tried to locate michelle's body with the map. but it only got them in the general vicinity.\n\nso they called us in the interview room and we decided to try the facetime, said harris.\n\nfacetime is the apple iphone's video phone app. you can see and hear whatever the person on the other end of the line wants to show you.\n\nmark was actually speaking to the detectives and they were holding their phone out, harris explained via facetime. they tried to follow it like a treasure map.\n\njust walking around aiming it, said smith.\n\ncorrect. and so they panned the area and then he told them to stop and he directed 'em towards - it was like more of a big scrub brush, harris said. when they got closer, that's when the fbi agent -- we could hear her say, 'i found her, i found her.'\n\nwith the discovery of michelle's body, castellano was finally arrested and charged with murder eight days after she went missing.\n\ndr. phil mcgraw's show went on tv a few days later.\n\nuntil castellano's confession, cayden had been staying with his relatives. but now, authorities moved him in with michelle's family.\n\nwhen 48 hours caught up with castellano behind bars, there were a few other things he wanted us to know, including a brand new version of what happened that night -- a 180-degree turnaround.\n\ncastellano's other story\n\nfrom the start, mark castellano had told everyone lies. so 48 hours' correspondent tracy smith wanted to set the ground rules before their interview.\n\nso here's the thing mark. you lied to the cops, you lied to dr. phil, you lied to your parents ... why should we believe you now? smith asked.\n\nwhat's the -- there's no point to lie about anything, castellano replied. i don't like lying. i don't like lying at all. it's not me. i'd rather just go ahead and tell the truth and get it over with.\n\nare you telling me the truth now? smith asked.\n\nyes. of course i'm telling you the truth, he said.\n\nthe first thing castellano wanted to tell 48 hours was that he was not a murderer.\n\nwe got into a fight it just - it just happened all wrong, he told smith. it wasn't, you know, not my finest hour.\n\nnot your finest hour?\n\nno, said castellano.\n\nwhy do you say that? smith asked.\n\nwell, i mean the whole thing wasn't my finest hour, castellano replied.\n\nhe says yes, it was true -- the couple had a fight that night, but he was the victim.\n\nasked if it got violent, castellano said, oh yeah, they always get violent. she beats the hell out of me. ...i've been beaten by this woman for a long time.\n\nbut this time castellano says he'd had enough. remember - there's never been an official report of abuse in this case.\n\nso, did you just snap? smith asked.\n\n...to, to retaliate back from her swinging at me? yeah, he replied. i snapped or hit her back ... this time i was tired of being hit ... and yeah, then i was gonna defend myself this time around.\n\nso you threw stuff back and forth and then you grabbed her, said smith.\n\ni didn't grab her yet. she threw another punch at me, castellano said. that's when i grabbed her and lunged forward.\n\nthis is where castellano's story changes from his confession to police:\n\nmark castellano to det. waters: i grabbed her and i broke her neck.\n\nso i want to go back to this confession. what actually happened that night? smith asked.\n\nthat's what we're not going to talk about, castellano's lawyer interrupted, telling him not to reveal all of what happened that night.\n\nstill, he did tell 48 hours a few details. castellano now says it was all an accident. in the struggle, he says, michelle died when he ended up falling on top of her neck.\n\nmichelle's death was my fault because ... i'm the one that fell on her, said castellano.\n\nthat fell on her, smith repeated.\n\nyes, i did fall on her. i mean, she just, like that, i mean she was just lifeless, castellano said, snapping his head back. and all of a sudden you know, her body let go ... and it was an accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nmichelle's mother, donna malone, can barely contain her disgust.\n\nfirst of all, i will never believe it was just an accident, she said. you just don't on accident murder someone and feel nothing.\n\nwhen you drive a car and you hit somebody, did you want to hit them, no. you're like, 'it was an accident. ...' you might be at someone's house and they just had brand new carpet put in and you're eating velvet cake and you dropped in on the floor. did you want to do it, no. do you feel bad about it, yes. but still, accidents are still accidents, they are not planned. that's why they're called accidents, castellano went on, shedding a tear.\n\nthat tear was the only time during the interview that castellano showed any emotion.\n\nhe's a liar, malone said. comparing it to spilling cake on someone's floor? to murder someone, that's a violent act.\n\ndid you choke her? smith asked castellano.\n\nno, i didn't choke her, he replied.\n\nbut you said you were angry.\n\noh, i was very angry.\n\nyou said you snapped, smith continued.\n\nyeah, and to go ahead and actually raise my hands against her, castellano said. i had a gun. i've always had a 9mm. if i really wanted to kill michelle, i would have shot her. ...i would have taken my gun and shot her.\n\nthat he could just have shot her if he wanted to kill her, that's just nonsense talk. it's nonsense, said malone.\n\nwhat did you do with michelle's body, smith asked.\n\nummm, it stayed, it stayed, ummm, it stayed in the closet. you know ... i looked at her and it was just like 'oh, my god.' so that's when i put the bag over her head and i put her in the closet.\n\nwhy the bag over her head? smith asked.\n\nbecause, just her face -- the way it was frozen, castellano told smith. i knew i messed up.\n\ndid it occur to you as you were handling her body that this was the woman that you loved? that this was the mother of your child? smith pressed.\n\ni did i did. and i also know i couldn't bring her back, he said.\n\nthree days later, castellano would dump michelle's lifeless body in that shallow grave.\n\nasked how he feels about misleading people for so long, castellano told smith, well, it was a tough call. ...it was a very tough call. ...i didn't plan on getting away with this. if i had planned on getting away with this, i would have gotten away with it.\n\ni feel very angry about the fact that mark lied to all of us. he could have just told the truth from the beginning. it was obvious that everyone was onto him -- family, law enforcement. why not just tell the truth, get it over with, said malone.\n\nshe did attack me first, castellano told smith.\n\nthe more mark castellano talked, the more it seemed he was angry with women.\n\ni mean that's just a fact. women are now -- y'all are replacing men in a lot of aspects. ya'll are becoming big time aggressors, he said. women are now the new aggressors.\n\nshe was beautiful, and you're a beautiful woman yourself. life's a little easier for women like you, because people can't put bad things with pretty people, castellano continued.\n\nit sounds like you resent that a little bit, mark, smith commented.\n\nwell, when you sit there and have been told that when you're are not a pretty person, that, ya know, life's gonna suck for you... he replied.\n\nmark castellano's bizarre answers during 48 hours' jailhouse interview raised more questions about what makes him tick. so we wanted to talk more about it with dr. phil mcgraw.\n\nmark castellano to tracy smith: i gotta say i really screwed myself over the way i confessed everything. and because, first of all, i didn't really describe everything accurately, and second of all, i didn't really think every word was going to be used completely out of context, which it was in a lot of ways.\n\nhe's criticizing the process. things were taken out of context. here's the context: did you kill her? or did you not? i think this guy has such an inferiority complex and that's one of the things about narcissism. there's a false sense of superiority, but it's a false sense of superiority, mcgraw said as he and smith watched the interview.\n\nthe truth is, they really feel inferior, said smith.\n\nthey really feel very inferior, very put upon. and he felt very much that he had reached above his level with michelle, said mcgraw.\n\nthat she was out of his league, so to speak, smith noted.\n\nout of his league. she was way over his head. in this instance, she did not reject him. he had the ultimate rejection of her, said mcgraw.\n\nwhat do you think his motive was? smith asked.\n\ni think this guy is very hedonistic, mcgraw replied. i think this relationship was on the down slope. i think it was falling apart. and i think he felt her slipping away. ...i think it was one of those situations where, 'if i can't have you, nobody will.'\n\n\n\n\n\nat his trial, castellano's attorneys will present his new version of what he says is the truth. will the jury buy it?\n\nfacing a jury\n\nit was very hard to wait on the trial. we wanted some form of justice for michelle, donna malone, said. we felt that we were building up to this pinnacle ... that would bring us some sort of peace.\n\nmay 27, 2014. mark castellano is on trial for the murder of michelle warner, the mother of their son, cayden.\n\nthis is a case about obsession, rage, and this defendant's calculated attempts to get away with murder, assistant district attorney jamie reyna told the court in her opening. he became so upset with michelle, that he grabbed her by the neck ... that he started to choke her, he started to squeeze her neck. you'll hear him tell those officers he choked her for one-and-a-half to two minutes.\n\nat the center of the prosecution's case - castellano's own words -- that videotaped confession to detective waters:\n\ndet. waters[interrogation]: we both know michelle didn't walk out of that apartment. so i want you to be honest with me, and tell me what happened... mark castellano: i grabbed her and i broke her neck.\n\nthe state medical examiner testifies michelle was strangled. her hyoid bone, just beneath her jaw, was broken.\n\nmark castellano does not take the stand. instead, his lawyer presents that very different story: michelle's death was an accident.\n\n...she comes at him, he grabs her, he's controlling her and he falls down with his weight on hers and hears a pop. when he reached out to defend himself to protect himself. he didn't anticipate that she would fall down and break her neck, defense attorney eric davis told jurors.\n\nan expert for the defense, a forensic engineer, testifies castellano's accident story was a possibility.\n\ni didn't find any real evidence that the throat was disturbed, john charles laughlin testified. there's no physical evidence that shows any type of squeezing or sideways forces. all of the physical evidence shows is forces applied from the front.\n\nso what's the detectives' reaction to castellano's defense?\n\nis that possible that he fell on her and that's how her neck snapped? smith asked sgt. brian harris.\n\nno, he replied.\n\nthe problem is that you cannot accidentally strangle someone for a minute-and-a half to two minutes, said det. fil waters.\n\nshow me what you think he did, what he told you he did to michelle. what did he do? smith asked harris.\n\nhe's so mad he follows her in the bedroom and he goes and whatever takes place, he reaches out and he's just grabbing her, for a minute-and-a-half or two. he's grabbing her, grabbing her, and she has nowhere to go, said harris.\n\nif castellano thought the jury might take pity on him, prosecutors would present more evidence that shows the actions of a cold, callous killer.\n\nweeks after castellano's confession, detectives discovered a chilling piece of surveillance video taken by a camera on a building located across from his apartment.\n\nthe video showed a shadowy view of the back stairs of castellano's apartment.\n\nso he drags her body in a bin down the stairs, smith said of the video, which shows a figure dragging something.\n\nyou see him stop. he has worn himself out, waters explained. he even says when he's on the phone with people he's confessing to, 'you know, michelle had gained a lot of weight.' so it was really an exercise to bring her down the steps and put her in the car.\n\nas for those hard drives that seemed to be so important in the early days of the investigation? it turns out they weren't relevant to the case.\n\nafter more than a week of testimony, 19 witnesses and six hours of deliberations, there's a verdict, ending an anxious wait for michelle's family.\n\nmark castellano is found guilty in the strangling death of michelle warner.\n\ni was very pleased with the fact that he was declared guilty, malone said. i said, 'ok, good. they did this quickly... so i believe that this is in the hands of a good, solid jury and they'll do the right thing.'\n\nthe next day, michelle's loved ones are back in court for castellano's sentencing. ironically, it's also michelle's birthday. she would have turned 33.\n\nmark castellano's attorney begs for mercy and argues his client's much-talked-about confession was a show of remorse.\n\nthe crime was solved because of a man's conscious. ...in fact, if mr. castellano had kept his mouth shut, we wouldn't be here ... but he did what most criminals don't do. he told on himself, davis told the court. no matter what you do, he is going to the penitentiary. the question is how long?\n\nmichelle's family wants to see castellano receive the harshest penalty: life in prison.\n\ni do not think that he has any sense of remorse. none, malone said. i hear nothing but excuses that it was michelle's fault that he did what he did and we all have free choice and he chose to kill her.\n\nthe jurors spend four hours debating his fate. finally, a decision: castellano is sentenced to 27 years.\n\nwhile castellano mouths thank you to the jury, the sentence feels like a slap in the face for michelle's family.\n\none word went through my mind when i heard 27 years -- seriously? malone said following the decision.\n\nafter several months, it is still impossible for the family to understand the jury's decision.\n\ni don't know what happened in the room while the deliberation was going on, because i've not -- had not one juror come forward and speak to me, malone said. i do not feel that i got closure for my daughter's death, and neither does any of the rest of her family. none of us do.\n\nnow it is up to michelle's family to explain to two kids -- a daughter living with her ex-husband and little cayden -- why their mother is gone.\n\nit's like taking your entire world and flipping it over, david chaffin said of his sister's murder. you don't expect anything like that to ever hit that close to home for you ... and it's turmoil.\n\nmichelle warner and her mother, donna malone donna malone\n\n\n\n\n\ni miss the laughter that i shared with her. ...and i just miss the conversation. i can't have that any more, malone said. and that's very sad. it's very lonely. ... it makes me feel lonely. so it's an empty hole that will always be there, for the rest of my life. and that's a hard thing to swallow.\n\nmark castellano will be eligible for parole in 2026, he will be 51 years old.
produced by josh yager\n\n[this story first aired on march 30. it was updated on aug. 17.]\n\nin july 2008, colonel michael stahlman was about to come home from iraq for r&r with his family when the military lawyer and former flight officer was found in his quarters with a gunshot wound to the head. he died about two months later.\n\nauthorities called it a suicide. but stahlman's wife kim and daughter mackenna say the man they loved would never have killed himself.\n\nmy dad … devoted his life to his country. he was a patriot, said mackenna.\n\nsomeone shot him, kim told 48 hours correspondent peter van sant.\n\nare you certain of that? van sant asked.\n\ni have no doubt, she replied.\n\nkim stahlman says her husband was right-handed, but his wound was on the left side -- and his job helping rebuild iraq's legal system could easily have made him enemies.\n\ni just feel like it was somebody mike knew, she said.\n\nat the heart of the mystery: an email that was sent just hours before the gunshot:\n\nkim, sorry about what you are about the [sic] find out. i love you and always will. you and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. love, mike.\n\nbut was it really a suicide note?\n\nthe evidence shows there's no way he could have done what they said he did, kim told van sant.\n\nasked if she's in denial, kim told van sant, no, no.\n\nkim started pushing the investigating agency, ncis, for more information. and she soon enlisted some important allies: cilla mccain, is an author and advocate for bereaved military families.\n\ni just do not believe that he pulled that trigger, said mccain.\n\nand michael maloney, is a forensic consultant who had once worked for ncis.\n\nthis is a homicide. there was someone else in that room, he said.\n\nmaloney had left ncis before the stahlman incident, but ncis hired blood stain expert mark reynolds.\n\ni see no evidence of homicide in the materials provided to me whatsoever, he told van sant.\n\nreynolds says michael maloney is guessing, or just plain wrong.\n\nthere's no evidence to support anything other than a suicide, reynolds said.\n\ntwo experts, two very different views.\n\nif this was a suicide, i would have to accept it kim said. but it's hard when you know that that's not what it was. … the truth needs to come out.\n\nfighting for the truth\n\nkim stahlman: you have to be strong as a military wife.\n\nfor more than 10 years, kim stahlman has been at war. with a small group of allies, she is targeting the toughest hill in washington d.c.—capitol hill\n\nkim stahlman: all i've ever done is tell them that i want the truth.\n\nshe says she's trying to honor the legacy of her husband, col. michael stahlman, one of the highest-ranking american fatalities in the iraq

found with a gunshot wound to the head on a ramadi military base. the armed forces medical examiner ruled it a suicide, but kim has never believed her husband shot himself.\n\nkim stahlman: it was not self-inflicted. absolutely not. someone shot him.\n\npeter van sant: someone shot him?\n\nkim stahlman [affirms]: mm-hmm.\n\npeter van sant: are you certain of that?\n\nkim stahlman: i have no doubt.\n\nkim says her ultimate goal is to get that manner of death changed on the death certificate.\n\nkim stahlman it's important to have the truth on that document … because of the man that mike was.\n\nsuzanna andrews | reporter: he was just this all-american guy. … very confident, very decent.\n\nsuzanna andrews and mike stahlman lived on the same block in chevy chase, maryland, as teenagers.\n\nsuzanna andrews: my mother still remembers him as the most polite child any of us ever brought home.\n\ndecades later, she wrote about his death as a contributing editor for more magazine.\n\nsuzanna andrews: i started out wanting to know what had really happened.\n\nmike stahlman, son of a u.s. diplomat, had lived in india, jordan and panama as a boy before returning home to become one of a few good men.\n\nmichael stahlman, a decorated marine, a flight officer and a military lawyer, was described as an all-american guy and poster boy for the marines kim stahlman\n\npeter van sant: was there a pride there and a sense of i really wanna serve my country?\n\nkim stahlman: oh yeah. … i mean, he's the one that elected to go to a marine … military academy in the 9th grade.\n\nas a cadet, stahlman was a marine recruiter's dream. he appeared in a promotional video.\n\nby april of 1987, michael stahlman was in flight school in pensacola, florida, when he landed in a bar in florence, south carolina, and boldly approached a striking woman across the room.\n\npeter van sant: and what did you think when you looked at this guy?\n\nkim stahlman: to be honest with you? … i didn't think anything, you know?\n\nbut she admits something about the swashbuckling young flight officer struck a chord - especially after they ran into each other again the next day at an air show.\n\nkim stahlman: he came up to me, he said, you remember me? and i'm like ah, yeah.\n\nstahlman offered to show her around, but she says he was quickly distracted by the triplet baby boys of someone she knew.\n\nkim stahlman: and he stopped, and he got down on his knee and he was talking to the -- these triplets … and i thought, oh, my god. that's someone special right there. and that's

2004.\n\nmackenna is 21 now and still remembers her father's kind heart.\n\nmackenna stahlman: during christmas it was his duty -- was the cameraman. … we'd wake up and we're, like, don't go in the room until dad has the camera ready. and -- that was probably one of the earliest memories i have.\n\nlike many military families, the stahlmans moved around the world: south carolina, california, and japan, where kim says she co-founded a counseling program on the base.\n\nkim stahlman: we worked specifically with rape victims and spousal abuse victims.\n\nmike's career was on the move, too. by the early 1990s, he'd traded in his wings for a law degree. kim says all the work and travel took a toll.\n\nkim stahlman: we moved every two -- sometimes every year.\n\npeter van sant: is it fair to say there was some trouble in the marriage?\n\nkim stahlman: oh, yeah. we have ups and downs like everybody else.\n\nafter about 20 years of high-stress military life, mike stahlman had risen through the ranks to become a full colonel.\n\nmackenna stahlman: he was about to retire.\n\nbut there still was one thing col. stahlman wanted to do. he'd never been deployed to a combat zone.\n\nsuzanna andrews: he volunteered.\n\nkim stahlman: this is his last hurrah, you know. he wants to do this.\n\nabout three months after he arrived in iraq, something happened to michael stahlman – something

fighting earlier in the war.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: the front gate is still getting shot at, vehicles getting hit … it's still a rough area.\n\nday-to-day life was tough. but morell says col. stahlman, who was working to help rebuild iraq's legal system, stood strong.\n\npeter van sant: did you ever sense that he was depressed?\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: oh, never.\n\na triathlete, stahlman was known to work out every morning.\n\nmackenna stahlman: he was always such a happy man. i don't ever recall him being upset or sad. i don't remember him crying, ever.\n\npeter van sant: did mike have any history of depression?\n\nkim stahlman: no.\n\ncol. michael stahlman kim stahlman\n\nby the summer of 2008, kim says mike was looking forward to coming home for r&r to spend time with her and the girls.\n\nmackenna stahlman: we were so close. i mean it was the home stretch.\n\nin june, he emailed: …just 2 more months until i come home. missing you terribly!!! and in late july, the day before the shooting: …everything is great!\n\nsgt. morell saw stahlman the night before the shooting.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: he was anxious to go home, he was ready.\n\nsuzanna andrews: in the morning he wakes up. he goes running, we believe.\n\ndave fuentes: i was … talking to some of the other medics, when the call came in.\n\narmy medic dave fuentes says he was just coming off shift at about 8 a.m., when he responded to a shooting scene.\n\npeter van sant: what condition was colonel stahlman in when you first laid eyes on him?\n\ndave fuentes: he was in very rough shape.\n\npeter van sant: critical condition?\n\ndave fuentes: absolutely 100 percent critical.\n\nit was still the previous night back in connecticut, where kim and the kids were visiting her parents. at about 11 p.m., she says she found a cryptic email in her inbox – apparently from her husband. the email became central to this case.\n\nkim stahlman [reading email]: kim, sorry about … what you are about to find out. i love you and always will. you and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. love mike.\n\npeter van sant: what did you think?\n\nkim stahlman: honestly, i immediately thought one of our close friends had been killed.\n\nthe next morning, kim got a devastating phone call.\n\nkim stahlman: they said -- we're calling … to inform you that your husband, colonel michael ross stahlman, was found this morning … with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his left temple.\n\nher husband was still alive, but unconscious.\n\nkim stahlman: it was like they took my past, my present and my future from me in that one phone call.\n\nkim says she was in shock. to some, that last email to her read like a suicide note. kim had the email examined by a linguist.\n\nkim stahlman: she said, this is not a suicide note.\n\nsgt. morell says he doesn't see it as a suicide note, either. he says marines are trained to avoid divulging too much information when writing home from war zones.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: you gotta talk in code … this is something that i could see me sending my wife and i felt i've sent her that letter before.\n\nhe says the email could have been a reference to any number of things, including a dangerous or classified military operation or personal finances.\n\nkim stahlman: all i could think of, his eyes. his beautiful eyes.\n\na few days later, kim and her daughters arrived at mike's bedside at bethesda naval hospital in maryland, where he'd been flown for treatment.\n\nkim stahlman: and i walked in the room and it didn't even look like him. his face was so swollen.\n\ndays turned into weeks with no improvement. slowly michael stahlman was slipping away.\n\nafter mike had been in the hospital about two months, kim decided to sit 11-year-old mackenna down to say her father would be taken off life support.\n\nmackenna stahlman: and she was like … we're not detecting any more brain waves … and that's when i had to lay in bed with him and say goodbye for the last time. … i just remember, like, the lights being dimmed, and i can still smell the hospital room [cries].\n\nthe stahlman family kim stahlman\n\ncolonel michael stahlman died on oct. 5, 2008, the day before his 21st wedding anniversary and the month before his 46th birthday.\n\nkim stahlman: i've never seen anyone die before. … i literally saw his spirit leave his body.\n\nhis funeral was at arlington national cemetery.\n\nmackenna stahlman: it was a closed casket. i just was hysterical pretty much the whole day.\n\nadding insult to injury, kim says she was still troubled by the information authorities had given her -- beginning with the detail that mike, a righty, had been shot on the left side of his head.\n\nkim stahlman: mike did nothing with his left hand.\n\nas time went on, her skepticism turned to anger and determination to find the truth.\n\npeter van sant: you became an investigator.\n\nkim stahlman: yeah.\n\nsuzanna andrews: kim said right away, i wanna do my own investigation.\n\nwriter suzanna andrews says col. stahlman's job easily could have made him a murder target.\n\nsuzanna andrews: mike was in iraq at a time when we were trying to sort of put the country back on its feet after the war.\n\ncolonel stahlman's work notes suggest he was aware of local officials on the take. he wrote: we want to stop ip's [iraqi police] from taking bribes. and andrews says some u.s. contractors were corrupt.\n\nsuzanna andrews: i think it would be really … hard to … have not stumbled across some kind of corruption there.\n\nsgt. morell says marines were vulnerable everywhere -- even on base.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: you know, our perimeter was very open.\n\nhe says the security fences were a joke.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: you could get on and get off.\n\npeter van sant: so, somebody from the outside could just come onto base.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: correct.\n\nkim says it's also possible col. stahlman had enemies closer than he thought.\n\npeter van sant: if mike did not take his own life, who did?\n\nkim stahlman: gut instinct is … it was somebody mike knew and close in rank.\n\npeter van sant: if you believe it's a homicide … somebody had to pull that trigger.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: right.\n\npeter van sant: give me a sense of the banter that was going' around.\n\ngunnery sgt. gary morell: that it was somebody inside. you know, strictly all rumors.\n\nmedic dave fuentes says he remembers hearing rumors, too, about a crime at a nearby facility – a crime he heard michael stahlman may have been investigating.\n\ndave fuentes: a couple other high-ranking personnel … had been relieved of duty due to -- stealing fuel from post and selling it to the locals.\n\nby a year after the shooting, kim stahlman had decided to go on the offensive. and before long, she had some very influential allies.\n\nmike maloney | former ncis: all of the evidence that i have, and all of the reconstruction i've done, point to this being a homicide, and absolutely not to being a suicide.\n\na quest begins\n\nafter her husband's death, kim stahlman was paralyzed by grief.\n\nkim stahlman: it's like a punch in the stomach…\n\nkim stahlman: … he loved his girls. he wouldn't have left 'em\n\nmackenna stahlman: she was basically a recluse. she never left the house. and it was really rough seeing her like that.\n\nkim emerged from her fog of grief and began a quest for the facts about her husband's death. in october 2008, she filed a freedom of information request with ncis, which had arrived at the scene some hours after stahlman was found. kim says she received about 1,500 documents and a small batch of photos.\n\nthe military says that my husband committed suicide, but i know it was murder, kim stahlman told 48 hours. cbs news\n\nkim stahlman: they didn't really show you anything. you know? and they were copies of copies. like the photocopies.\n\nscouring the reports, kim says she learned her husband had been found in bed, lying on his back, next to a bloodstained nightstand. a bloodied sheet was hanging from the top bunk obscuring his body. a bible and family photo lay next to him. stahlman's 9 mm beretta was on the bed, too. one first responder noted the gun appeared wedged between him and the mattress.\n\ninvestigators took photos of michael stahlman's quarters in ramadi, iraq, after he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. responders found stahlman in his bed [bottom bunk] with a sheet hanging down from the top bunk, obscuring him from view. evidence photo\n\nsuzanna andrews: the gun is half under him around his waist but pointed down.\n\naccording to ncis documents, a bullet from his gun traveled through his head, then through a wall and came to rest on the floor of a storage locker in the housing unit next door. an earwitness had reported hearing a loud noise around sunrise. the information did not satisfy kim.\n\nkim stahlman: there were little flags, things that jumped out at me.\n\nbelieving the suicide determination had been made in haste, kim says she wanted a closer investigation of the case. in the coming years, she would contact the military, members of congress, and even the white house.\n\nkim stahlman: i was looking … for anything any – any help i could get.\n\nsince the shooting, kim had been fighting her war alone. but in 2009, she met an important ally: author cilla mccain.\n\ncilla mccain: she was grieving, totally grief stricken, but fighting.\n\nmccain has a special interest in mysterious military deaths. she supports the families with a website and advocates for them with lawmakers.\n\ncilla mccain: i know of 166 families who believe that their loved one was murdered and it has been labeled a suicide.\n\ntogether, kim and mccain say they took on the u.s. military.\n\nsuzanna andrews: here was this duo, these southern women … up against this brass wall. you know, all these officers and soldiers and institutions who just didn't take them seriously at all.\n\nbefore long, word of their war would win them another important ally. this one had a worldwide reputation investigating cases at, of all places, ncis itself.\n\nmike maloney | former ncis: if it bled, if it blew up, if it caught fire … generally, we were involved in handling the forensic issues of that.\n\nover a long career at ncis, michael maloney investigated some of their highest-profile cases. he'd left ncis and was teaching forensics when a student told him about the stahlman case. he offered to take an initial look pro bono, but gave kim a warning.\n\nmichael maloney: almost 100 percent of the time the death is exactly what it's reported to be.\n\nmaloney wanted better quality photos and thought authorities might have them. so, he helped kim file another freedom of information act request.\n\nkim stahlman: there were almost 200 photos on that disc. if i hadn't asked for those, they woulda never volunteered 'em.\n\nmaloney says those photos led to a breakthrough.\n\nmichael maloney: it changed the whole game.\n\nporing over the new photos, maloney reached a startling conclusion.\n\nmichael maloney: this is a homicide … there was someone else in that room.\n\nhe believes an assailant probably fired two shots: one missed and the other went through stahlman's head. he also believes the scene then could have been made to look like stahlman had been alone and shot himself with his own gun.\n\nkim stahlman: all i remember is him sayin', we've got a problem. this was staged.\n\npeter van sant: and when you heard those words?\n\nkim stahlman: it was like, oh, holy jesus. i'm right.\n\nmaloney set up a simulation for 48 hours to help illustrate his theory: the trajectory of the bullet authorities recovered in the locker does not account for col. stahlman's injury.\n\nwhy is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? michael maloney asked, pointing to a diagram. they should overlap each other. because the bullet has to cause the injury. cbs news\n\nmichael maloney [pointing to top of a graph]: why is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? [pointing to bottom area of graph]. they should overlap each other. because the bullet has to cause the injury.\n\nin his theory, maloney says the bullet hole in the wall likely came from the assailant's first shot -- a shot that maloney believes missed col. stahlman. evidence photo\n\nmaloney says the bullet hole in the wall, as seen in the investigator's photo, likely came from the assailant's first shot.\n\nmichael maloney: for the first shot, he's going to fire and he's going to miss. that explains the hole in the wall.\n\nhe says what he sees around that hole is a telltale sign that the bullet never went through stahlman's head.\n\nmichael maloney: it has the appearance of gunshot residue.\n\npeter van sant: all these little dots\n\nmichael maloney: all those little dots --\n\npeter van sant: this could be gunshot residue –\n\nmichael maloney: burned … and unburned particles of gunpowder coming out of the muzzle of the weapon.\n\nmichael maloney points to what he believe is gunshot residue in a photo taken by investigators cbs news\n\nin his interpretation, those particles would be unlikely to have hit that area of the wall, if col. stahlman's head had been in the way of the bullet.\n\nmichael maloney: this is when i began to believe that, perhaps, this wasn't the shot. this wasn't the fatal shot.\n\nthe fatal shot, says maloney, would have been the second one.\n\nmichael maloney: and as he [stahlman] starts to move, the shooter is going to rock up as well and right in here, the shooter can fire as well.\n\nhe believes the bullet may have come to rest in the mattress, though that alleged second bullet has never been found. maloney thinks he knows why.\n\npeter van sant: all of this was destroyed, correct?\n\nmichael maloney: all of this was burned as a biohazard, yes.\n\nmichael maloney: now let's look at that nightstand.\n\nthe bloody nightstand, says maloney, supports his theory, too, because he says the stains only cover certain areas --\n\nmichael maloney [pointing to evidence photo]: but we have none in this area or this area.\n\n-- leaving unstained sections called voids.\n\nmichael maloney: there was something blocking the blood from hitting this surface of the nightstand.\n\nthat something, he says, could have been the assailant's body.\n\nmichael maloney: someone sitting on the nightstand, facing his bed.\n\nand maloney says there's more evidence stahlman may not have been alone. he says it looks to him like a woman could have been in the room.\n\nmichael maloney: well, there was a … tampon found on the floor.\n\nthere also was a dirty strip of fabric nearby.\n\nmichael maloney: it … certainly would have the appearance of a sheer bathrobe tie or something like that.\n\npeter van sant: there has been speculation that … mike stahlman perhaps had a girlfriend there.\n\nmichael maloney: well … what you propose is well within the realm of possibility.\n\nkim stahlman [negates]: no. uh-uh.\n\npeter van sant: a one-night stand with someone?\n\nkim stahlman: no. i would have known, i think.\n\nbut either way, maloney says the strongest evidence supporting his theory of homicide is that sheet hanging over stahlman's bed. it had blood on both sides. but, he says, what's most important is a particular type of stain called misting.\n\nmichael maloney [looking at a photo of the bloody sheet ]: look at this misting … the problem is, this on the outside of the sheet. … this tells me that this side of the sheet had to be facing or oriented towards his injuries at the time they occurred.\n\nhe says if the sheet was hanging down during the shooting, as it was found by first responders, the misting stains would have been on the inside. maloney demonstrated for 48 hours.\n\nmichael maloney: a lot of times when you are over there, you do drop a sheet … it blocks the light coming in from the windows. but, if you want to talk to someone, you can just pull the sheet back, and tuck it up.\n\nmaloney demonstrated by tucking the sheet into the springs of the overhead bunk.\n\nthe bloodstains at the scene, he says, strongly suggest the sheet was tucked up, out of the way, when the fatal shot was fired.\n\nmichael maloney [demonstrating in simulation]: …and it causes the bloodstain up here, the bloodstain pattern here, the misting stain, and the rest of the bloodstain from the exit wound goes down into the pillow and into the mattress.\n\nremember, the mattress was destroyed.\n\npeter van sant: how about the sheets and the blood?\n\nkim stahlman: burnt. everything.\n\nkim stahlman filed a lawsuit in 2013, alleging authorities conducted little or no investigation into various aspects of the scene.\n\ncilla mccain: they did not follow their own protocols, and that's why this has happened.\n\na federal judge dismissed the case saying the court had no jurisdiction. so, kim filed again with a military review board. her lawyer says the board offered no assistance either.\n\nmichael maloney: this required a thorough investigation. it didn't get one.\n\nmichael maloney says he sent his 2011 report to his old employer, ncis, and says they refused to meet with him about his findings. they declined to give 48 hours an on-camera interview.\n\nbut there is another side to this story.\n\npeter van sant: kim, it turns out that ncis did do a forensic investigation … we have some clips … that we would like you to listen to.\n\ntwo experts, two conclusions\n\npeter van sant: do you believe that ncis ever did a proper forensic examination of the shooting scene?\n\nkim stahlman: no. no.\n\n48 hours submitted its own freedom of information act request, and we discovered it's not quite that simple.\n\nmark reynolds: my name is dr. mark reynolds. i'm a forensic consultant and i investigated the, ah, death of colonel stahlman.\n\ndr. mark reynolds was brought on by ncis in 2012 to review the case more than three years after the shooting, including michael maloney's report.\n\nncis gave the veteran homicide investigator and bloodstain pattern expert permission to speak with 48 hours.\n\npeter van sant: did you have everything you needed?\n\nmark reynolds: i -- the short answer is no. … i was quite critical of the response by ncis in my report about the scene.\n\nreynolds told 48 hours he concurs with michael maloney that the shooting scene should have been handled differently.\n\nmark reynolds: a better documentation of the scene and better exhibit collection would've been helpful … and it wasn't done.\n\nhe says that's partly because col. stahlman was still alive when he was found. so, first responders rightly were focused more on stabilizing him than preserving evidence. but reynolds disagrees with maloney on just about everything else.\n\nmark reynolds: all the scene indicators that mr. maloney has raised -- are either equivocal or wrong.\n\npeter van sant: mike maloney has a great reputation. … so, we're supposed to believe, in this particular case, the man doesn't know what he's talking about?\n\nmark reynolds: in this particular case, believe the science. and the science is there.\n\nreynolds says maloney based many of his conclusions on speculation. he says his own analysis of photos of the bloodstains, the nightstand, the sheet, the bullet hole and the trajectory, yielded no evidence anyone else was involved in stahlman's death. reynolds says the unstained area on the nightstand is too narrow to be meaningful.\n\nmark reynolds [looking at a photo of the nightstand]: if mr. maloney is suggesting that that … might've been the leg of the attacker … it's three inches … that's a fairly thin leg.\n\nand what about that sheet hanging from the bunk above stahlman's bed, the one that michael maloney claims has bloodstain misting on the wrong side?\n\nmark reynolds: transfer bloodstains look like spatter even under the microscope.\n\nreynolds says the bloodstains could have been transferred there by first responders.\n\npeter van sant: in your opinion, there's nothing conclusive about this blood issue on the sheet?\n\nmark reynolds: no.\n\nand he says the same is true of the gray spots near the bullet hole, which maloney suspects are gunshot residue.\n\nmark reynolds: it was never determined. there was no sampling ever done. to go from a grayish particulate matter on a wall … to extrapolate that as being gunshot residue i think is very dangerous leap. it could've been anything on that wall.\n\npeter van sant: you don't even go to this potential two-shot scenario?\n\nmark reynolds: there's no scientific evidence to say two shots were fired.\n\ndocuments indicate authorities did check the mattress for a bullet and didn't find one. and mark reynolds says michael maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. he says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with col. stahlman's head wound.\n\nmark reynolds believes michael maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. reynolds says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with col. stahlman's head wound.\n\nmark reynolds [showing the diagram]: did you get that?\n\npeter van sant: that matches.\n\nmark reynolds: that matches.\n\nbut what about the curious items on the floor? like that piece of fabric that maloney feels could have belonged to a woman?\n\nmark reynolds: pure speculation.\n\nand that tampon?\n\nmark reynolds: many soldiers around the world carry tampons in case they get shot because they put the tampon in the bullet hole and it stems the flow of blood.\n\nreynold's conclusion?\n\nmark reynolds: there is no obvious scientific evidence to indicate that it was a homicide.\n\n48 hours informed michael maloney about mark reynolds' findings. maloney insists reynolds is wrong.\n\nmichael maloney: i stand by my assertion that the best explanation given the evidence that i've examined, does not indicate suicide.\n\ntwo experts, two very different conclusions.\n\npeter van sant: have you ever heard of a man by the name of mark reynolds?\n\nkim stahlman: no.\n\npeter van sant: never?\n\nkim stahlman: no.\n\n48 hours wanted to see what kim stahlman thought of mark reynolds' findings.\n\npeter van sant [with kim]: we have some clips from the interview that we did with mark reynolds that we would like you to listen to.\n\n48 hours showed kim van sant's interviews with reynolds on an ipad:\n\npeter van sant [looking at a photo of col. stahlman's bunk]: mike maloney says at best, this is an ambiguous death scene. mark reynolds: my interpretation of this is there's strong contextual and scientific support for it being self-inflicted. there is no contextual or scientific support in my opinion for it being a homicide.\n\npeter van sant: and the fact that it's on the outside of the sheet, when the shooting occurred on the inside ... is an indication that someone pulled the sheet down. mark reynolds: i think he doesn't understand how difficult it is to classify bloodstains on fabrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nkim stahlman [reacting to the video]: yeah, i mean, i guess he's got his opinion. i don't know what to say.\n\nkim says she brought the case to other experts who supported maloney's findings, and she still stands by maloney.\n\nkim stahlman: i know that maloney broke down the room pixel by pixel -- that's all i know.\n\nand kim is furious. she says authorities should have showed her the reynolds report years ago.\n\nkim stahlman [emotional]: why didn't they show me that? or tell me so that i could at least know. i don't understand why ncis did not bring that to my attention, ever.\n\nkim says she has never felt authorities have respected her. in fact, in 2012, she says she discovered an email showing someone at ncis appears to have blamed her for her husband's death.\n\npeter van sant [reading the email]: it was a tragic suicide contributed by the pressures he was under to include stress piled on by his wife, who now believes/pretends it was a storybook marriage …\n\nkim stahlman: i never said it was a storybook marriage. never. … i have said it was a marriage with ups and downs.\n\nas 48 hours discovered in his emails, col. michael stahlman may have been battling an enemy within.\n\nwhat is the truth?\n\nkim stahlman has always accused ncis of not conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nkim stahlman: i think … they thought they could get away with their mistakes.\n\nbut ncis documents suggest otherwise -- that evidence was collected, people were questioned, and many of kim's concerns were answered.\n\nthey also provided her with all those photos and thousands of documents, many of which were passed on to 48 hours. among them, emails between kim and mike in the final months of his life. some are loving and upbeat. but there are others that raise troubling questions about mike and the marriage, like one from kim sent about two weeks before the shooting:\n\ni just can't keep putting myself on a guilt trip anymore and blame myself for our problems.\n\npeter van sant: what problems are you talking about in this?\n\nkim stahlman: we had gotten to the point where we really didn't communicate. … and so we were talking about seeing a counselor for that.\n\npeter van sant: you went on to say, after that, i can't make any promises because at this point, i feel it is about life and death for me. i can't stay in an unhealthy relationship.\n\nkim stahlman: right.\n\npeter van sant: here's the next quote: i know i've done some terrible, hurtful things to you and vica versa. … what's the terrible thing?\n\nkim stahlman: well to me -- i can't think of a specific thing, but ...\n\npeter van sant: it sounds like your relationship is almost at the end of the line here.\n\nkim stahlman: i'm a bit of a drama queen. … but it didn't -- that's not where it ended. and it doesn't show the conversations we had on the phone.\n\nit's that last email mike stahlman apparently wrote to his wife not long before the shooting that strikes some as the strongest proof of suicide.\n\npeter van sant: is this in your opinion a suicide note?\n\nstuart bowen: no. clearly not.\n\nstuart bowen may be kim stahlman's best hope of getting authorities to listen. bowen was the george w. bush administration's special inspector general for iraq reconstruction. kim first contacted him in 2011. he says he reviewed her legal filings and michael maloney's report and discussed the report with maloney extensively.\n\npeter van sant: what have you concluded?\n\nstuart bowen: it was not a suicide. i believe that he was murdered.\n\nbowen says authorities may have cut corners early on.\n\nstuart bowen: it might be the case that the rush to judgment … led to practices that departed from best practices.\n\nthough in 2017 bowen resigned from a government job in texas amid unrelated ethics allegations which he denies, he has become one of kim's most important supporters.\n\nstuart bowen: she's committed to the truth about what happened.\n\nbowen and kim have helped cilla mccain and others push congress for a bill of rights for bereaved families. mccain says many have nowhere else to turn.\n\nkim stahman and supporters for a bill of rights for bereaved families take on capitol hill cbs news\n\ncilla mccain: there's no court in which they can say, hey … let's hear this fairly with unbiased eyes and ears. it doesn't exist for military families.\n\nrecently, another significant step forward. bowen says he convinced the military's new chief medical examiner to take another look at the official findings in the case.\n\nstuart bowen: he assured me that he's going to review it closely and discuss it widely.\n\npeter van sant: is that a big deal?\n\nkim stahlman: oh, god. yeah.\n\npeter van sant: because what can that medical examiner do?\n\nkim stahlman: change … the death certificate.\n\nafter spending about 10 years looking into this case, cilla mccain is writing a book about it with kim.\n\ncilla mccain: i have pored over thousands -- thousands of documents. i have talked to anybody that i could find.\n\nmccain says in her experience, authorities rarely change their findings. and last summer, ncis sent 48 hours a statement saying:\n\nncis has thoroughly investigated this case and we continue to stand by our investigative findings.\n\nncis's independent expert mark reynolds insists the science strongly suggests how col. stahlman sustained his fatal wound. but reynolds also surprised 48 hours.\n\npeter van sant: do you feel 100-percent certain that this is a suicide?\n\nmark reynolds: no. i think that -- if it was a hidden ... homicide, it was sophisticated and ... it won't be determined forensically. it'll be determined investigatively.\n\npeter van sant: would you be professionally troubled … if this this case was changed to undetermined?\n\nmark reynolds: would i be professionally troubled? no.\n\npeter van sant: can you live with undetermined?\n\nkim stahlman: that's like saying, eh, it can be this, it can be that. no. i may have to live with it, however i don't want to. i don't think it's fair to my children.\n\npeter van sant: you've been described as a woman in denial about all of this.\n\nkim stahlman [affirms]: mm-hmm.\n\npeter van sant: you're not in denial?\n\nkim stahlman: no. no.\n\nfar from it, she insists.\n\nkim stahlman: it would have been easier for me if it had been a suicide. at least i could move on with my freakin' life.\n\nkim recently visited her husband's grave at arlington national cemetery. she's now thinking of moving his remains closer to home.\n\nkim stahlman: a man gave his entire life to his country, and for what? they didn't support him in the end.\n\nas for the man they loved, col. stahlman's family knows they may never prove how he died, but they will always be proud of how he lived.\n\nit's my duty to carry on his legacy, mackenna stahlman, now 21, said. my father … was probably the best man that i have ever met and might ever will meet. kim stahlman\n\nmackenna stahlman: it's my duty to carry on his legacy and do great things so he'll be proud of me in whatever i end up doing in my life. ... my father … was probably the best man that i have ever met and

salt lake city -- the mormon church said tuesday it will sever all ties with the boy scouts of america at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. the move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nthe announcement by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and boy scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\njoining the boy scouts is practically automatic among mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states. the mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nthe mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nthe boy scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to scouts bsa to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nlike other conservative faiths, the mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. the church initially said it was deeply troubled by the boy scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nthe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nthe mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of god.\n\nthe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to boy scouts, but it won't be modeled after boy scouts or use ranks. the 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the boy scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nmore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the u.s. and canada.\n\nthe boy scouts of america in a statement thanked the thousands of mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. the organization said individual mormons who wish to stay in boy scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nthe boy scouts' move to allow girls, announced last october, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nthe organization already has started allowing girls into the cub scouts. so far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 cub scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled scout me in.\n\nthough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the boy scouts of america, and the cub scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nthe boy scout movement had been entrenched in mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nin 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in salt lake city to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the boy scouts.\n\na boy scout training complex in west virginia is named after former mormon church president thomas s. monson, a longtime member of the boy scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
knox county, indiana -- we came to indiana looking for one of life's most elusive secrets.\n\nwe'd heard that deep within knox county, indiana -- back among cornfields -- there was a cluster of people who had all unlocked the mystery of a long and happy marriage.\n\nbut here's what's even more remarkable: they're all related.\n\ntogether, the eight clinkenbeard siblings have amassed nearly half a millennia of marriage -- 449 years in total. so i figured if anyone had the secret to wedded bliss, it would have to be these couples.\n\nthe clinkenbeards and their spouses cbs news\n\ni gathered them for a series of interviews, and here's what i learned: if you want to stay married forever, women, you need to speak your minds.\n\ni could tell when she was ticked, said jim clinkenbeard.\n\nor not.\n\ni usually keep my mouth shut, said barbara kirk.\n\nand men, you need to be deferential.\n\nyou treat a lady like a lady, said bruce clinkenbeard.\n\nor not.\n\ni said, 'i love to fish and i'm not going to change that,' said paul clinkenbeard.\n\nunfortunately, almost everything i got was a contradiction.\n\ndorothy clinkenbeard, right clinkenbeard family\n\nreally, the only thing the clinkenbeards could agree on was what their mother dorothy taught them and told them repeatedly -- that, except in very rare circumstances, divorce should not be an option.\n\nshe instilled that in us kids, you know, bruce said.\n\nmy mom was pretty stickler about that, said bill clinkenbeard.\n\nwhen we said 'i do,' to me that meant however long we lived, said dan yagle.\n\nit meant suffering through some bumpy times, but the oldest brother john says it's well worth it in the end.\n\nwe've been married 65 years, he said.\n\njohn clinkenbeard, holding a picture of him and his wife lillian cbs news\n\njohn sat on the couch alone because his wife, lillian, is in the hospital.\n\ni don't know how i'd get along without her.\n\ni never got my easy answer to what makes a happy marriage.\n\nwe love one another, paul said.\n\nbut i did get eight solid reasons -- to never give up looking.\n\nas ed kirk put it, i couldn't imagine life without her.\n\nto contact on the road, or to send us a story idea, email us: ontheroad@cbsnews.com
love and marriage may go together like a horse and carriage, but personal finances can often un-hitch a couple.\n\nvalentine's day may be a celebration of romance, but it's also a day when would-be romeos and juliets get tripped up by financial pitfalls, such as misjudging how much to spend on that candle-lit dinner. but it also underscores a deeper problem that many encounter in their relationships -- when partners have different approaches to handling their money.\n\nfinancial stress is a leading source of relationship trouble, often coming when one partner is a saver and the other is a spender. yet more than half of americans say they don't consider whether their potential partner is good at handling their money before they jump into an exclusive relationship, according to a new study from lender affirm. that could spell problems later on.\n\nmost americans in committed relationships say financial mistakes made by their partners as a result of bad money management are what upsets them most, said elizabeth allin, vice president of communications at affirm. there's a disconnect between what we're prioritizing when we date someone versus the expectations we have once we're committed.\n\none place to start: your potential partner's credit score. americans with higher credit scores are 14 percent more likely to find love within the next year compared with singles who have scores 100 points lower, the federal reserve found in a 2015 study.\n\nperhaps more important for long-lasting love, couples with similar credit scores are more likely to stick together, the fed found. that could reflect a shared outlook about financial management and obligations.\n\nbut many americans aren't honest with their partners about their financial details, a trait that can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. men are more secretive, with only about half telling their partners how much they earn, according to a survey from financial firm aspiration. about sixty percent of women spill the beans about their finances to their partners, it found.\n\nit's better to be upfront with your partner, said affirm's allin.\n\naccording to our research, talking about financial goals and habits transparently can be a factor in a long partnership -- only 4 percent of couples who have been married for over 20 years say it's hard to discuss finances, she noted.\n\nhere are five money mistakes that could doom your romance.\n\nspending too much on a first date. on valentine's day, it might be better to ease up on lavish spending, at least if it's a first date. only one out of 10 women surveyed by affirm said it was reasonable for their date to spend more than $100, although one-quarter of men said they thought it was the right amount to spend. women tend to be more aware of expenses and concerned about unnecessary spending than men, despite the assumption by some men that they must spend a lot to impress right out of the gate, allin said.\n\nincurring bank fees -- and library fines. bank fees such as overdraft charges are considered turnoffs by potential partners, affirm found. that's because these fees can signal a lack of financial control and result in charges that could have typically been avoided. but respondents said other types of avoidable fees were also red flags -- including parking tickets, credit card late fees and even library fines.\n\nwhen it comes to small mistakes, men and women agreed they would be most upset about a bank account overdraft fee, but nearly half of women ranked this as no. 1 compared to 37 percent of men, allin said.\n\nnot being financially transparent. most americans want to know the nitty-gritty of their partner's financial situation before they tie the knot, including sharing their credit scores and how much they spend on bills. almost one-third of married millennials said they later regretted not finding out more about their partner's finances before getting hitched, compared with 14 percent of boomers.\n\nhaving a lousy credit score. men and women agree that a low credit score is a turnoff, according to affirm. a majority of those with scores above 750 -- considered to be a good score -- take responsibility for paying bills, compared with only 37 percent of those in the subprime range.\n\nhiding credit cards or assets from your partner. it's not uncommon for americans to hide assets, credit cards or bank accounts from their significant others, an action that can lead to relationship stress. about 15 million u.s. adults who are currently in live-in relationship say they're guilty of such financial infidelity, according to creditcards.com. such secrecy can add stress to a relationship -- as well as emotional devastation if the partner discovers the hidden financial activity.
target's (tgt) policy of letting transgender customers and employees use the bathroom of their choice is now drawing fire from texas officials. the state's attorney general, ken paxton, wants the retailer to spell out how it will protect customers who he suggested could be endangered by the policy.\n\nregardless of whether texas legislates on this topic, it is possible that allowing men in women's restrooms could lead to criminal and otherwise unwanted activity, he said in a may 3 letter to target ceo brian cornell. as chief lawyer and law enforcement officer for the state of texas, i ask that you provide the full text of target's safety policies regarding the protection of women and children from those who would use the cover of target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.\n\nthe move by texas to pressure target comes as north carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the justice department says violates civil rights law.\n\nafter states including north carolina and mississippi recently enacted anti-gay laws, target last month reaffirmed its commitment to protecting gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. the retailer's public stance drew a boycott effort by a conservative christian group, along with a rebuke from an alabama city that is home to a target.\n\nthe national debate over lgbt rights is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but experts say the target brand is unlikely to face any long-term damage.\n\ntarget's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, melissa arnoff, senior vice president at levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.\n\ntarget is doing the right thing to what it has been as a brand, arnoff said. i'm sure they are looking at the data and sales. as a smart company they will pay more attention to that kind of data than the number of names on a petition.\n\nthe move by texas to pressure target comes as north carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the justice department says violates civil rights law.\n\nthis topic is not going away, added ted marzilli, chief executive officer at yougov brandindex, which conducts daily surveys to monitor public views of 1,500 brands.\n\ntarget has been pretty balanced in terms of how they've been communicating with the media, he said. they are not being combative, they are just saying look, this is our policy, i don't think they are stirring up the pot, or trying to pick a bigger fight.\n\nstill, while consumers' perception of target fell to an eight-month low after the retailer found itself in the headlines, it's doubtful the company will remain a focus of the story, marzilli said. any negative impact is likely to pale in comparison to the retailer's effort to regain consumers' trust after a security breach compromised customer information in late 2013. that was a much, much bigger deal, he said.\n\ntarget spokeswoman molly snyder acknowledged getting the texas attorney general's request to spell out its safety practices. the company has robust procedures, policies and training in place to ensure that our stores are safe places to work and shop, she said, declining further comment.\n\nmarc rylander, paxton's communications director, said target had not yet responded to the attorney general's request. we asked them for safety policies, and we hope to hear from them.\n\npaxton on monday voiced support for north carolina in its legal fight with the u.s. department of justice, saying in a statement that he backs the principle that persons should use restrooms and other intimate facilities that correspond with their biological sex.\n\nthe equal opportunity employment commission last year called equal access to restrooms a significant, basic condition of employment and said that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory.\n\nthe federal government and north carolina governor pat mccrory sued each other on monday, the deadline mccory had been given to confirm his state would not implement the law he signed in march.\n\nnorth carolina stands to pass up $4.8 billion in funds, mostly educational grants, if it refuses to reverse course, according to an analysis by lawyers at the university of california, los angeles law school, who estimated 37,800 transgender people live in the state.\n\nas for the financial hit target may or may not take as a result of its policy, marzilli said he thinks it's likely the retailer would suffer a one-to-two month impact on its bottom line, and quickly recover.\n\nwhile there a lot of people who are very vocal saying they won't shop at target, some may shop more at target, he said. a year from now, target may be remembered for being one of the first to step up to the plate, which history might prove was the right stance to take.
kelly clarkson is officially a mother-of-two!\n\nthe 33-year-old singer gave birth to her second child, a boy, on tuesday, april 12, confirming the news herself later in the week.\n\nour little baby boy has arrived!! remington alexander blackstock was born 4/12/16 & he is healthy & we couldn't be happier or more in love! clarkson tweeted on thursday morning.\n\nthis is clarkson's second child with her husband, talent manager brandon blackstock. clarkson is already a mother to her 1-year-old daughter river rose, and is a stepmom to blackstock's two children from a previous marriage.\n\nmerry christmas from the blackstock clan! @gameofthrones #gameofthrones #winteriscoming #riverisnotworried a photo posted by kelly clarkson (@kellyclarkson) on dec 8, 2015 at 2:28pm pst\n\n\n\nit's safe to say the american idol champ has been eager to give birth leading up to the big day. responding to a trisha yearwood tweet earlier this month of a coffee mug reading, i can't even, clarkson wrote, girl, this describes my day. i feel like rachel on friends w/this baby #getoutgetoutgetout hahaha.\n\nshe's also made it no secret that she's had extremely difficult pregnancieswith both river and her newborn son.\n\nhonestly, the first one was really rough, and i was like, 'oh, it can't happen again,' and no it happened, like, way worse this time, clarkson shared in a radio interview with australia's kiis fm last month, explaining that her ailment is 100 times worse than morning sickness. i just get hospitalized, and i have to get fluids. it's just, like, my body was not made to be pregnant.\n\ni wish i was like the girl that ... it's beautiful, but it's not, she added.\n\nand if all goes according to plan, this will be her last pregnancy.\n\noh, no, we are done, she laughed. oh good lord, yes, i can't be pregnant again. this will be our number four total, so we're good.\n\none thing she can definitely count on is her husband of two years being a great father to their kids.\n\nwatching my husband love on his daughter all the time, you know, go to her events and just be there and, like, be present is, like, hard to watch but beautiful to watch, clarkson told ryan seacrest during a radio interview in february, fighting back tears. but it's awesome because i know that my kids are going to have that.\n\ni cannot imagine not seeing this kid to his or her full potential and just seeing what she's going to do, what she's going to be like, she continued.
during the 2016 presidential race, donald trump famously said i could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn't lose any voters.\n\nand if he fired that shot in an evangelical church, he could probably get the pastor to help steady his aim.\n\ndespite the titillating details from stormy daniels on 60 minutes this week and the mounting evidence of his infidelity to third wife, melania, the gop's so-called values voters—people who loudly condemned bill clinton for his infidelity—are standing by president trump. as one-time clinton critic tony perkins of the family research council said regarding trump's stormy sexual misbehavior: we gave him a mulligan.\n\nas a graduate of oral roberts university myself, i don't recall exactly which book of the bible mentions the mulligan (proverbs, maybe? it has a solomonic sound). but the need for forgiveness is certainly a biblical principle, and the willingness of christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.\n\nbut to receive forgiveness, one must confess the sin first. and president trump has yet to admit his relationship with ms. daniels, much less ask forgiveness for it.\n\nand it appears he doesn't need to. after a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the stormy daniels story broke, president trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to morning consult. evangelicals are so willing to support president trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.\n\nconsider these numbers:\n\nin 2011, just 30 percent of evangelical voters believed that an elected official who committed an immoral act in their personal life had the ethical character to hold public office. by october 2016—on the eve of their massive turnout on behalf of p***y-grabbing donald trump, that number was up to 72 percent, according to a survey conducted by prri and the brookings institution.\n\nperhaps most astonishing, a recent yougov poll found only half of trump voters said trump cheating on his wife with stormy daniels would be immoral, even if it did happen. after everything they've learned about him, 56 percent of trump supporters believe the phrase moral leader describes the president either very well or extremely well.\n\nhow did the same americans who clamored for bill clinton to be impeached for lying about his affairs turn into voters who aren't even sure cheating is immoral at all? it's that magic word:\n\nclinton.\n\nevangelicals remember how feminists and liberals who claimed to care deeply about the treatment of women in the workplace rallied around bill clinton, despite his behavior with a white house intern. bring up stormy daniels to politically active social conservatives and they're likely to bring up nina burleigh, the former time reporter who said during the clinton scandal that she would be willing to engage in the same activity as monica lewinsky to thank him for keeping abortion legal.\n\nas conservative townhall.com columnist and trump supporter kurt schlichter puts it: i see no reason not to play by [democrats'] rules…not allowing the other side to gain an advantage by weaponizing morality against us.\n\ntrump's affairs are a side show, schlichter tweeted.\n\ni see no reason not to play by the new rules. i don't have to like them, but i refused to unilaterally disarm. if that makes me a terrible person, so be it, and i'll be a terrible person not under a liberal fascist dictatorship. — kurt schlichter (@kurtschlichter) march 26, 2018\n\nthen there's the other clinton argument christians use: hillary.\n\nevangelical voters felt under siege during the obama years, from nuns hit with government mandates regarding birth control to christian business owners forced to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies. many believed a hillary clinton presidency would bring even more government assaults against people of faith.\n\nthey note that during a 2015 speech addressing the issue of abortion, for example, candidate hillary clinton said deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\n\npeople of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.and while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as mark hemingway calls him in the conservative weekly standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, trump got the job.\n\nas tony perkins told politico.com, the relationship between evangelicals and trump is transactional. they give the president their loyalty, and he gives them political support.\n\nfrom a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime.\n\nis the transaction worth it? in the gospel of mark, jesus asks for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n\nthen again, jesus never voted in a republican primary.

all the democratic candidates who ran for president in 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nbehind joe biden's search for a running mate 02:04 more democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than america has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. here's a look at all the democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on president trump in november 2020.\n\neric swalwell biography although he was born in iowa in 1980, swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in california. he was recruited to play soccer for north carolina's campbell university. after suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the university of maryland. after completing his undergraduate studies, swalwell earned his j.d. from the university of maryland and was a congressional intern for former california rep. ellen tauscher. in 2012, while a council member in dublin city, in california's alameda county, swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow democrat and 20-term incumbent pete stark in the state's 15th congressional district, located in the outer suburbs of san francisco. although stark bested him in the primary election, swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of california's top two primary system. swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 since he was sworn-in in 2013, swalwell has won reelection three times. although he has been a rank-and-file member of the house democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the trump administration as a member of the intelligence and judiciary committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances. on the intelligence committee, swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel robert mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the russian government, including the infamous trump tower meeting between donald trump jr. and other campaign officials and a russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on hillary clinton during the summer of 2016. issues swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. he has been strongly critical of the national rifle association's (nra) sway in congress and has repeatedly lambasted republicans for not supporting gun control measures. he is hosting a town hall on gun control in florida tuesday alongside survivors of the stoneman douglas high school massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. last week, the california democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. we're going to war. and you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by swalwell on twitter is heard saying. in his post, swalwell wrote, i'm not afraid of this guy. i'm not afraid of the nra. i'm not afraid. no fear. #endgunviolence. controversy while swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in congress, the california democrat will surely face criticism from mr. trump and republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the mueller probe. what trump says the president has yet to tweet about swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the justice department's summary of the mueller report. in a memorandum, tim murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge swalwell and other prominent democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and moscow.\n\ntim ryan biography ryan was born and raised in northeastern ohio in 1973. he played football in high school and was recruited to play for youngstown state university. because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to bowling green state university, near toledo. after graduating from college, ryan earned a j.d. from the university of new hampshire and worked in the office of longtime ohio congressman james traficant, who was expelled from the house after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. at age 26, ryan was elected to ohio's state senate. when his old boss tradicant became embroiled in scandal, ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. at 29, he was the youngest member of congress when he was sworn in 2003. although he has served eight terms in the house, ryan gained notoriety following mr. trump's unexpected election in november 2016. citing democrats' loss of midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace nancy pelosi, then house minority leader. after democrats retook control of the house during the 2018 november midterm elections, the ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace pelosi. ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. rep. tim ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 issues ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in congress. he is not a member of any of the major democratic caucuses in the house, like the pro-business new democrat coalition or the congressional progressive caucus. he once earned an a rating from the national rife association (nra) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by republicans. but ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like medicare for all. controversy ryan's tenure in congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some democratic primary voters. what trump says although ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, mr. trump has not yet tweeted about the ohio congressman.\n\nwayne messam screenshot from wayne messam's 2020 campaign video wayne for america biography born in pahokee, florida and raised in south bay, mayor wayne messam became the first african american mayor of the city of miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. messam's parents immigrated to south florida from jamaica. his father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the florida glades after coming to the united states, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. messam earned a full football scholarship to florida state university, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 national championship team under legendary coach bobby bowden. he would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, angela, more than 20 years ago. they have three children, wayne ii, and twin daughters, kayla and kyla. issues while lacking name recognition outside florida, messam told cnn that under his leadership, the city of miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from hurricane irma. he has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. these are issues that have national implications and i'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the american people and i'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the united states, he said. in his campaign announcement video, the democrat claimed that washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. what trump says messam has not yet been a target for president trump.\n\nbeto o'rourke beto o'rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 biography o'rourke was born and raised in the texas border city of el paso. although his legal first name is robert, he has been known as beto, the nickname spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like roberto and alberto, since childhood. he was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the el paso-based punk group foss after graduating from columbia university in new york in 1995. o'rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to el paso from new york city. after working on several local political campaigns, o'rourke ran for the el paso city council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. he served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. in 2012, o'rourke, who speaks fluent spanish, announced his candidacy for the democratic primary in the race to represent texas 16th congressional district, a latino-majority district encompassing el paso and the surrounding communities. he managed to topple eight-term incumbent silvestre reyes in the primary and defeated his republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. while in congress, the texas democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the armed services and veterans affairs committees. on immigration, o'rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. in 2014, he called president obama's executive action creating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed congress. he also backed ohio rep. tim ryan's leadership challenge against then-minority leader nancy pelosi in 2016. o'rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust cruz in 2018. his robust senate bid in texas -- along with his obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. although he failed to unseat cruz, o'rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in texas -- including the state's large and growing latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. no democrat had come that close to winning a senate race in texas since 1988. despite the loss, o'rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. although he told 60 minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, o'rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. issues in his six years in congress, o'rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, lgbt rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights. he often called for improvements to the affordable care act, president obama's signature domestic policy achievement. during and after his senate campaign, o'rourke made immigration a central issue. he has routinely denounced the white house for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the u.s.-mexico border. he also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as dreamers, on a pathway to u.s. citizenship. during a fiery speech in el paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with president trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, o'rourke condemned mr. turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. we know that walls do not save lives. walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of mr. trump's nearby rallies. in the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. controversy in addition to the scrutiny o'rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a senate race, the texas democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in congress and personal life. although he had a generally liberal voting record in congress, o'rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left. in the house, he was a member of the pro-business new democrat coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the democratic party to support more audacious efforts, like the green new deal, to mitigate climate change. during his senate campaign, o'rourke refused to back medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 democrats have vouched their support for. medicare for all emerges as first litmus test for 2020 democratic contenders\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez introduces 2020 policy test with green new deal some candidness may also follow the lead of o'rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. in 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a dwi program the following year. o'rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the houston chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. what trump says mr. trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an o'rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the texas democrat's unsuccessful senate bid. i thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, mr. trump told reporters in december. when the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed o'rourke's great defeat in november.\n\njohn hickenlooper john hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 biography former colorado governor john hickenlooper grew up outside of philadelphia, the youngest of four children. he attended wesleyan university and received a bachelor's in english and a master's degree in geology. hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with buckhorn petroleum in the 1980s. but the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. there were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the wynkoop brewing co. the brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. in 2003, hickenlooper ran for mayor of denver, in his first ever campaign. considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. in 2010, hickenlooper became the first denver mayor elected governor in 120 years. he was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a democratic presidential bid this cycle, following washington gov. jay inslee. issues finishing his second term in the statehouse, hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. he left colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. it's that record that he touted in h is campaign video. i'm running for president because we need dreamers in washington but we also need to get things done, hickenlooper says in the video. i've proven again and again i can bring people together to produce the progressive change washington has failed to deliver. as governor, hickenlooper also signed an expansion of medicaid in 2013. he has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. hickenlooper has opposed a number of trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted hickenlooper so far.\n\njay inslee jay inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 biography born and raised in seattle, inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the university of washington in 1973 and a j.d. from willamette university college of law in oregon three years later. after working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the washington house of representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for congress in 1992. inslee represented the state's 4th congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called republican revolution of 1994. during the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional department of health and human services (hhs) director under president clinton. inslee ran for congress again in 1998 and defeated a republican incumbent in washington's 1st congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. during his congressional tenure, the washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the american economy's reliance on fossil fuels. inslee left congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in washington, defeating the state's republican attorney general in the general election. after winning reelection in november 2016 -- the same time mr. trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- inslee declared that washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. however, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in washington. what trump says mr. trump has yet to tweet about inslee or his presidential aspirations. in february 2018, however, the washington governor confronted the president in the white house about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. i just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. and let's just take that off the table and move forward, inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the east room. although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, mr. trump listened with his arms crossed while inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure\n\nbernie sanders bernie sanders on 2020: we're going to win 04:49 biography although he has spent most of his adult life in vermont, bernie sanders was born and raised in brooklyn, new york, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant jewish family. he attended one year at brooklyn college before transferring to the university of chicago and graduating in 1964. at the university of chicago, sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the congress of racial equality and the student nonviolent coordinating committee. he was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the vietnam war. he moved to vermont in 1968. sanders ran for governor of vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent liberty union party. he was elected mayor of burlington, vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. he was elected to the house of representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the senate in 2006. although technically still an independent, he caucuses with democrats in the senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. sanders unsuccessfully ran for the democratic nomination for president in 2016. however, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign. his campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual democratic nominee hillary clinton. since the 2016 campaign, some of sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the democratic party, such as his medicare-for-all proposal. issues sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the medicare-for-all bill with 15 other senators in 2017. he also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they american worker. he opposed nafta and the trans pacific partnership, trade deals which president trump renegotiated or withdrew from. sanders opposed the u.s. war in iraq, and remains a critic of american military interventionism. controversy more than two dozen of sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of december seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. a new york times story in early january reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which sanders apologized. politico also reported in early january that his former iowa campaign manager, robert becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees. sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. what trump says president trump has alternated between praising sanders and insulting him as crazy. as some of mr. trump and sanders' populist ideas overlap, mr. trump often said during the 2016 campaign that sanders voters would defect to him over hillary clinton in the general election. mr. trump also accused clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from sanders, and criticized sanders for eventually endorsing clinton. while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, mr. trump tweeted in july 2016. wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary, he wrote in another july tweet. in several subsequent tweets, mr. trump has called sanders crazy bernie. he has often referred to the 2016 democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.\n\namy klobuchar klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 biography amy klobuchar was born in plymouth, minnesota, in

from drinking, he retorted: have you? the moment quickly went viral, and kavanaugh later apologized. controversy klobuchar was the sole senator from minnesota during the resolution of the contested senate election from january to july 2009, which al franken eventually won. when franken was accused of sexual harassment in december 2017, klobuchar did not call for franken to step down, unlike many other senators. franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. i felt i was in a different role as his colleague, that i'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and i felt it was best to handle it in that way, klobuchar told cnn at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. what trump says a few hours after her announcement,

booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor ronald rice. during his seven-year tenure as mayor, booker was praised for attracting large companies to newark and revamping the city's downtown. but he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. the only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'meet the press,' newark's current mayor, ras baraka, said when he was a councilman during booker's mayoral administration. after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform

increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system. controversy although he has a liberal voting record in the senate and has been a staunch critic of the trump administration, booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. in what he touted as his spartacus moment, booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious senate confirmation of justice brett

law school at the university of california, hastings. upon graduation, harris stayed in the golden state and worked for the alameda county district attorney's office in oakland. in 2003, she was elected san francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. during her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. after winning a hotly contested race in 2010, harris became california's first female attorney general, as well as the first indian-american and jamaican-american to hold the post. during her two terms, harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. after sen. barbara boxer announced her retirement, harris launched a bid for her seat. in 2016, she defeated rep. loretta sanchez, also a democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent california in the senate. during her two years on capitol hill, harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the judiciary and homeland security and governmental affairs committees.

from some progressives for her law enforcement work. some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. critics have pointed to california's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. if kamala harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor lara bazelon in an opinion piece for the new york times. what trump says although mr. trump has not yet tweeted about harris, the white house has previously criticized the california senator. in the summer of 2018, the white house twitter account wrote,

minimum wage job at sears. she has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the university of houston. she began law school at rutgers university when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at harvard law school. massachusetts rep. joe kennedy iii and arkansas sen. tom cotton were among her students there. after the 2008 financial collapse, warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the troubled asset relief program, known as tarp. she served as the architect of the consumer financial protection bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as dodd-frank. in those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. but her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the republican party and among wall street bankers. such opposition derailed obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the cfpb. instead, she ran for the u.s. senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent massachusetts republican sen. scott brown--her first run at public office. warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. during a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. the problem is washington works great for those with influence. warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. we make our campaigns work through the people. controversy warren's claims of native american ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the senate. in an attempt to silence critics --namely, president trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, warren released the results of a dna test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of native american heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. the move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and native american groups. and it raised questions about how effectively warren will be able to compete with president trump. what trump says the heritage controversy put warren high on mr. trump's hit list. he frequently refers to her as pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a dna test. he later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize warren over the backlash to her dna video. she did very badly in proving that she was of indian heritage. that didn't work out too well, trump told fox news in an interview on new year's eve. we'll see how she does. i wish her well, i hope she does well. i'd love to run against her. warren frequently taunted mr. trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. asked by fox news whether warren would be able to win, the president said, well, that i don't know. you would have to ask her psychiatrist.\n\nkirsten gillibrand sen. kirstin gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 biography kirsten gillibrand,

democratic donors, including billionaire george soros, have said that they will not support gillibrand because of her position on franken. she has also distanced herself from the clintons. in november 2017, she said that president bill clinton should have resigned after his affair with white house intern monica lewinsky became public. what trump says president trump tweeted at gillibrand in december 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used! mr. trump tweeted. critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. you cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the oval office, gillibrand wrote on twitter in response.\n\njulián castro julián castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 biography julián castro was born one

housing and urban development secretary. during the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for hillary clinton, although clinton eventually chose virginia sen. tim kaine. castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting new hampshire and publishing a memoir, an unlikely journey: waking up from my american dream, in october. he announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president jan. 12. castro and his wife, erica, have two

matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. the need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. we all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. we all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, castro said.\n\ntulsi gabbard rep. tulsi gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 biography tulsi gabbard was born in american samoa in 1981, and her family moved to hawaii when she was 2 years old. her mother, carol, is a practicing hindu, a religion gabbard adopted. her father, mike, is a member of the hawaii state senate. after growing up in a politically active family, gabbard became a member of the hawaii house of representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. while serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the hawaii army national guard. she deployed in iraq and returned in 2006. after returning from her second deployment in 2009, gabbard ran for honolulu city council. she served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. she was elected to the house of representatives in 2012. she was the first practicing hindu in congress. issues gabbard is

about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. after her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. in 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. to try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, gabbard said at the time, according to cnn's kfile. as democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. gabbard apologized to lgbtq activists in the state when running for congress in 2012. she apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy.

chemical attack. gabbard called the u.s. bombing reckless and questioned whether assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other democratic politicians. in november, she said in a tweet that president trump is saudi arabia's bitch for announcing the u.s. will stand with saudi arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman's

i do … until i don't is very personal for lake bell, who wrote, directed and produced the romantic comedy.\n\nbell started working on the screenplay nine years ago. the plot revolves around three couples who are taking part in a documentary about marriage, directed by an eccentric and cynical filmmaker who believes marriage should be a renewable seven-year contract. bell stars as alice, a woman who runs a blinds store with her husband, noah, played by ed helms, in vero beach, florida, where bell spent part of her childhood.\n\nbell told cbs news when she started writing the film, she had a therapeutic need to investigate the institution of marriage.\n\ni really felt that marriage was archaic, she said. i did share the ideology and theories that the documentarian, vivian, depicted in the movie. i was sort of more of a vivian to start with, and during the writing of this film i met my husband, scott campbell, so it was kind of a beautiful lesson and continues to be.\n\nbell said her cynicism of stems from the fact that she was one and a half when her parents divorced.\n\ni was part of a pretty difficult divorce and i grew up with other family members and friends who were all kind of getting divorced, so it just felt like a doomed concept, and when i was starting to write the movie, i believed 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?' she said. so if you're with someone you love, why not just be with them, which is the fanny and xander ideology. every character in this movie does feel deeply personal in my unpacking of the subject matter. fanny and xander, played by amber heard and wyatt cenac, respectively, play a carefree hippie couple in an open relationship.\n\nwyatt cenac and amber heard play a couple in an open relationship in i do ... until i don't. the film arcade\n\nbut bell said in the process of the film, she started to change her mind about marriage.\n\ni fell madly in love with my husband and even though he's covered head to toe in tattoos, he's more traditional -- he's from the south -- and i remember being really afraid to take on this thing that i had never really understood, she explained. i did tell him, 'well, i am afraid, but i can't think of anyone else i'd rather be afraid with.'\n\nbell and campbell have been married for four years and together for seven, and she said what she appreciates about marriage is how much she has evolved.\n\nit's harder to grow if you're living in a single vortex, where no one is calling you out on your [expletive] and when the going gets tough, you don't fail, but when you're in a committed relationship, you're constantly looking in the mirror and at your flaws by way of your partner and vice versa, said bell. and we love therapy. you don't have to be a raging lunatic to go to therapy to improve. it's just self-love, and taking care of thyself is what really inspires you to take care of each other.\n\nbell said that to write the script, she envisioned herself as each character, but she was especially excited to play alice.\n\nit's really fun to take on characters who are not an obvious casting choice for me, she said. alice sort of apologizes for the space she takes up in the world and she's extremely low-status and she's repressed and that's just something i haven't gotten to do in my career.\n\nbell admitted she has an agenda in making this film.\n\nit has a happy ending and it's built that way and i always wanted it that way, she said. i really wanted this story and investigation to end with hope, because i think ultimately as a previous unromantic, i was hoping deep down to be proven wrong.
baltimore -- the maryland parents behind a controversial youtube channel featuring videos of them playing pranks on their children were sentenced to five years of supervised probation, cbs station wjz-tv reports.\n\nheather and mike martin each entered alford pleas to two counts of child neglect of their two youngest kids. their pleas mean they did not admit to any abuse but acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to prove it.\n\nprosecutors say a psychologist determined the kids were traumatized by these pranks. the judge didn't think they were funny either.\n\nthis was far beyond corporal punishment, frederick county state's attorney charlie smith said. this was egregious, abusive conduct, and i didn't think it was funny from the beginning, and, obviously, the judge didn't either.\n\nhundreds of videos on the couple's daddyofive youtube channel showed everything from smashing electronics to a fake robbery and other elaborate pranks where they appear to terrify their five children. the martins quickly reached 800,000 followers after launching the channel.\n\nwe were just messing around one day, having fun, joking around, and we ended up doing the prank, and we put it on youtube, and it blew up, mike martin told wjz in the spring.\n\nbut one video in particular, posted in april, changed everything for the family. it showed their son sobbing as they were screaming at him for spilling ink, which they actually did for the prank.\n\nthe video went viral, and outraged fans went on the attack, accusing the couple of exploiting their children. it triggered an international firestorm and an investigation by child protective services. eventually, they were charged.\n\nafter the controversy began, the couple removed most of their videos from the daddyofive channel. one of only two videos remaining is a public apology, which they posted on april 22.\n\nwe have made some terrible parenting decisions, heather martin said in the video.\n\nmike martin is the biological father of the two children at the center of the charges, and heather martin is their stepmother. the other three children in the videos are from heather martin's previous marriage.\n\nthe couple is not allowed to contact the two allegedly neglected children in any way without a judge's approval. they're back with their biological mother.\n\nthe couple claimed they made the videos to help provide a better life for their kids. they had hundreds of thousands of followers and made hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nthe couple has launched two new youtube channels since the controversy began, called mommyofive and daddyofive gaming.
on this valentine's day, new research shows a revolution is in the works when it comes to finding love that lasts. the concept is called slow love. marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship. now it's the finale, biological anthropologist helen fisher said thursday on cbs this morning.\n\nin her annual study with match.com, fisher saw signs of a new approach to the courtship process. from a national sample of more than 35,000 single adults, 66 percent said they've had one-night stands, 54 percent have had uncommitted friends-with-benefits relationships, and 56 percent said they've lived together with a partner before marriage.\n\nwhat's really happening is we're seeing an extension of the pre-commitment stage of love, fisher said. and americans seem to think that this is reckless, and it began to occur to me it's caution. these people want to know every single thing about a person before they tie the knot.\n\none of the main strategies is they first start out with just friends. and then they move into friends with benefits. don't tell anybody. secretive. non-committal. and then have the official first date, she added.\n\nfisher said singles today are terrified of divorce and want to make a solid partnership.\n\nso i began to think, with this long pre-commitment stage, maybe you're learning a lot, you're getting rid of what you don't want, so that by the time you walk down the aisle, you got what you want. you can keep what you want, she said.\n\nfisher has also done research with people who have been married for an average of 21 years. she said through brain scans, she was able to see three parts of the brain that become active in a long-term and happy marriage: [a] brain region linked with empathy, a brain region linked with controlling your own stress and your own emotions, and a brain region linked with overlooking the negative and focusing on the positive. what we call the positive illusions.

for 32 years, movie star annette bening has always stood out, in films such as valmont, bugsy, the american president, the women and 20th century women, earning four oscar nominations along the way (for her performances in the grifters, american beauty, being julia and the kids are all right).\n\ni've been asked to do really interesting characters in the midst of great stories with great writing, bening said. and great writing usually involves flaws. it's not about playing people who are strong. it's about trying to find the humanity in people.\n\nand she's at it again, this time on broadway, in arthur miller's all my sons. for bening, being on stage has been a kind of homecoming. my family's from the midwest. i was born in kansas. so, many of my relatives in iowa had this very backyard, she said of the play's setting.\n\nactress annette bening with correspondent serena altschul on the stage for all my sons. cbs news\n\nboth she and the production have been nominated for tonys this year.\n\nset in 1947, all my sons centers on the keller family, whose two sons were in world war ii. after one, a pilot, was reported missing, their mom, kate, can't accept even the possibility he could be dead.\n\ncorrespondent serena altschul asked, how do you feel about kate?\n\ni love her, bening replied. that's the pleasure we have as actors. we get to love the characters because we don't have to judge them.\n\nannette bening and tracy letts in the broadway revival of all my sons. cbs news\n\nbening said it's a role she always wanted to play, in part because the story mirrors events in her own history: my mom's family had two sons that went to the war, my uncle russell and my uncle roy. they both enlisted after pearl harbor. they were both in their late twenties.\n\nroy became a marine, russell a pilot. his plane crashed from mechanical failure. the body of his copilot was found, but my uncle russell's body was never found. so, there's a lot of personal connection in my family to the world that arthur miller was writing about.\n\nthe actress, a tony nominee for the broadway revival of arthur miller's classic drama, has an emotional connection to its story of a family's loss during world war ii. cbs news\n\nand, she says, she draws on that connection each night.\n\naltschul asked, do you get a certain catharsis when you relive what kate goes through every night? are you working through that loss, in a way?\n\ni have a theory that maybe if you're working in the right way, it is a cathartic experience. so afterwards, you feel unburdened, she replied.\n\nher first and only other time on broadway was in 1987's coastal disturbances. she earned a tony nomination then, too, and soon hollywood beckoned.\n\ni was lucky, she said of the great opportunities in her film career. and i also didn't start doing movies 'til i was almost 30. i wasn't a kid.\n\nin 1990, she met actor and heartthrob warren beatty on the set of the film bugsy. they married in 1992.\n\naltschul asked, how does one make a marriage work for 27 years?\n\nwell, i think mutual respect, and that we very much want the same things, bening replied. so, he's very tolerant of living with me!\n\nand you of him, right?\n\nyes. i would say yes, she laughed.\n\nthere were skeptics in the beginning; what do you say to them?\n\nwhat can i say? i don't know, we've been married 27 years. we have four children. i think that sorta says it all, doesn't it? bening laughed.\n\nannette bening and warren beatty arrive at the academy awards in this 2011 file photo. frazer harrison/getty images\n\nand, she says, together they created the life she dreamed of. i always wanted children, from when i was really little, like a little girl, seven or eight years old. and my children, who are now adults, they're in the stage of their lives where they're getting their education and they're working and falling in love. and it's also a very cool stage of parenting that i'm really enjoying.\n\nbening prefers to let her kids speak for themselves. for instance, her oldest, stephen, is outspoken as an advocate in the transgender community.\n\naltschul asked, what can you say to other moms wanting to help their children find themselves and be exactly what they feel they are?\n\nbening replied, well, it's what we all want to do as parents. and i think that the tricky part is, that your kids have to go through difficulties and pain. and i didn't even know it, but there was a part of me that thought, if i got it right, i could maybe parent my kids in such a way that they wouldn't have to experience pain, she laughed. which is, of course, ridiculous! you want to shield them.\n\nbut what you learn is how powerless you are. you have a lot that you can do to help and love your kids. and of course, you do anything you can to support them and love them. but they go through what they're gonna go through. and they have a right to do that. and there's a dignity to that.\n\nas her children move on, she says, for beatty and herself it seems like old times. my husband and i now, we have more time just for each other, and for work. and i can come and do this play in new york.\n\nhas he come yet?\n\nyes. an dhe's been incredibly supportive and enthusiastic.\n\nand he's not the only one. critics, audiences and, of course, the tony awards nominating committee are raving about bening's performance.\n\nbut, bening said, we don't talk about it.\n\nyou don't? no, we don't talk about it. we just focus on the work.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\narthur miller's all my sons at the american airlines theatre (through june 30) | ticket info\n\n\n\nstory produced by mary raffalli.\n\n\n\nsee also:

released its debut album, kissing to be clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's colour by numbers, which featured the single karma chameleon. it was all enough to snag culture club the best new artist win in 1983. the band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. during that time, though, george's drug addiction and relationship with culture club drummer moss took a toll on the band. throughout the years culture club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. a 2014 reunion tour -- with the original

the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before milli vanilli swooped up the best new artist honor at the grammys. the award was later revoked -- the only time a grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. morvan and pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any

correspondent erin moriarty investigates the disappearance of jennifer dulos, a connecticut mother of five, and the case against fotis dulos and michelle troconis in what does the other woman know? the disappearance of jennifer dulos airing saturday, february 13 at 10/9c on cbs.\n\nwhat does 46-year-old michelle troconis know? does she know what happened to jennifer dulos, the connecticut mother who vanished without a trace from her home on may 24, 2019? and if jennifer dulos was murdered, does troconis know how and where dulos' killer put her body? connecticut authorities believe troconis may hold the key to the mystery of the missing mom and can lead them to jennifer dulos' remains. they have charged her with conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with evidence in the case.\n\nin newly released portions of interrogation videos, troconis, the former girlfriend of jennifer's estranged husband, is seen answering questions, at times pleading with investigators. her attorney says he has seen no evidence that troconis knows what happened to jennifer and says she is simply a victim of overzealous investigators desperate to solve the case.\n\nmichelle troconis and fotis dulos sotiria kontouli\n\nmichelle troconis has a lot in common with the woman she is accused of helping to kill: tall, willowy, and talented, both women fell hard for the same man, fotis dulos, a handsome, charismatic home developer and daring athlete. by the time troconis met fotis dulos in 2016, his 12-year marriage to jennifer had run out of steam. they were essentially living separate lives in a huge home fotis had built in farmington, connecticut. fotis dulos thrived on excitement and athletic competition while jennifer mainly focused her energies into the day-to-day caring of five young children. once a playwright and co-founder of a theatre troupe, jennifer put her passions into loving and writing about her children, all under the age of 13.\n\nfotis, a waterskiing champion, hoped the same for his children and traveled with them to competitions. during his travels, he met and fell for troconis, who was also a talented athlete. he met her in miami and it was serious, says his sister, rena dulos kyrimi. he was very much in love. the problem was fotis dulos was still very much married and living with jennifer.\n\ntroconis never intended to become the other woman says her family. she thought the couple was already divorcing and didn't know the truth, they say, until long after she uprooted her life and moved with her daughter to connecticut.\n\njennifer dulos carrie luft\n\nafter jennifer dulos learned of her husband's affair in early 2017, she left him and moved their children into a rented home 70 miles away in new canaan, connecticut. the once-happy union became a bitter, contentious divorce and custody battle that drained fotis dulos of much of what mattered to him: money, work and, when he defied a court order and allowed his girlfriend to have contact with his children, he also lost shared physical custody.\n\non friday morning, may 24, 2019, jennifer, 50, vanished after taking her children to school. her suburban suv was later found abandoned a little over three miles from her home. soon after police found evidence of blood inside jennifer's garage, the missing person case became a homicide investigation. what investigators discovered next put jennifer's estranged 51-year-old husband on the top of the list of suspects. that's when his girlfriend michelle troconis became a person of interest as well.\n\nafter fotis dulos gave investigators his cellphone, they discovered that he had been on albany avenue in hartford, connecticut, the night that jennifer went missing. as they collected surveillance footage of the area, they saw a man who looked like fotis dulos dropping off black bags in trash cans on the street. and a woman seen leaning out of his truck appeared to be michelle troconis. what investigators later found in those bags convinced them they had jennifer's killer: zip ties coated with human blood and jennifer dulos' dna, two ponchos covered with copious amounts of blood and more dna belonging to jennifer dulos. as lead investigator sergeant ken ventresca of the connecticut state police later said, it's not every day someone throws out bloody evidence, bloody clothes, you know, cut up. i mean who does that?\n\nthe next day, both fotis dulos and michelle troconis were arrested and charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. seven months later, in january 2020, when investigators still could not locate jennifer dulos, they charged her husband with murder and upgraded troconis' charges to conspiracy to commit murder. kent mawhinney, a friend and sometime lawyer for fotis dulos, was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. all three pleaded not guilty. just weeks later, fotis dulos was dead after taking his own life.\n\nthe death of fotis dulos left michelle troconis in a precarious legal position, says her attorney, jon schoenhorn. i think the right expression here is, 'she's left holding the bag.' authorities still plan on pursuing charges including conspiracy to commit murder against troconis, leaving her facing the possibility of years in prison for the death of a woman she never met and whose body has never been found.\n\nlate last year, michelle troconis, two of her sisters and her father met with 48 hours in connecticut. troconis is very thin, with the weight of the past year etched in her eyes and face. although she declined to answer questions, her attorney and family answered an array of questions ranging from why troconis moved to connecticut in the first place to what she knew about jennifer dulos' disappearance.\n\nthey say that when michelle troconis moved with her young daughter to connecticut, she knew nothing about the difficulties in the dulos marriage. attorney schoenhorn says fotis lied to michelle, telling her that the couple was amicably divorcing.\n\nwell, hindsight, of course, is 20/20, right? schoenhorn said. ...had she even known about how contentious the relationship became between jennifer and fotis, she never would have moved up here. and fotis dulos didn't just lie to michelle, says her family. he lied to all of them as well.\n\nmichelle's youngest sister, claudia, insists michelle had no involvement in jennifer dulos' disappearance. she's never been a violent person, claudia says. she's never been revengeful, you know. ... she's a mother herself.\n\nbut what about the surveillance footage that appears to show michelle inside fotis dulos' truck as he is discarding that incriminating trash on albany avenue in hartford? schoenhorn says he knows of no evidence that michelle knew jennifer dulos was missing at that point or that she had any idea what was inside the black bags.\n\nschoenhorn says no physical evidence ties michelle to any of the evidence recovered from that night and points to those police videos that, he says, show michelle cooperating with police. she not only did not know what was in those bags, says schoenhorn, ...she told police this multiple times, she had no idea what he was actually doing.\n\nbut connecticut investigators say michelle troconis changed her stories over the course of three interviews and they believe she knows more than what she is saying.\n\ndoes michelle troconis know what happened to jennifer dulos? if she doesn't, it's just possible that fotis dulos took that secret to his grave, leaving his own children a terrible legacy of loss.

the smartest advice i've gotten about betting on the oscars is: don't put your money on what you like best. you're just begging to lose.\n\nkeep score: download our academy awards nominations ballot for your office pool or oscar party (pdf)\n\nthe trick is to project yourself into the head of the average academy voter, who – wanting you to keep buying tickets – is trying to project him- or herself into your (the average moviegoer's) head. so, it's a nutty feedback loop.\n\nsome people have said, why would they nominate junk like 'joker'? no one has a clue, especially me! but i do know joker won't win best picture, which is fine. i thought it was one unpleasant note hit harder and harder. but joaquin phoenix will take best actor, because he's the best unhinged movie actor in the world, and he's never had a part with fewer hinges.\n\ncementing the idea that borderline personalities are in is the lock for renée zellweger in judy. she nails judy garland who in the end was torn between sashaying onstage or jumping out the nearest window.\n\nthe best supporting turn was by joe pesci in the irishman in a non-joe pesci role – conflict-averse. but i'll still be thrilled when brad pitt wins for once upon a time… in hollywood.\n\nlaura dern has won every other award as a calculating divorce lawyer in marriage story. but the twice-nominated scarlett johannsen could sneak in as the classiest character in the slapstick nazi weeper jo jo rabbit, a hodgepodge that's well-liked in hollywood.\n\nbest director? i predict bong joon-ho for parasite, with its surreal metaphor for income inequality – beautiful people on top, underclass below – and underclass under the underclass waiting to pop out and say boo!\n\nbut best picture? 1917, the kind of movie hollywood adores: state-of-the-art, wedded to old-fashioned, lump-in-the-throat anti-war melodrama. new and old … that's what they like. that's what they think you'll like.\n\ni'll be watching for the edgier stuff – the complaints about lack of diversity, netflix, the president (don't forget him!), and also to see how presenters address the legacy of kirk douglas.\n\nyou will see a longing for change, side-by-side with a dread of change. bet on it!\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by robbyn mcfadden.
hilary duff's divorce from her ex, retired nhl star mike comrie, has been finalized.\n\nthe younger actress, who filed for divorce in february 2015 citing irreconcilable differences, will have to pay her ex $2,408,786.40. this specific number equals 50 percent of the value of the couple's beverly hills mansion, which duff will keep.\n\non top of the money, comrie will also get to keep a number of the couple's valuable vehicles, including a 2014 bentley and a 2013 mercedes suv, as well as some jewelry and several joint possessions.\n\nthe couple signed an enforceable prenuptial agreement before tying the knot, meaning they share no community property. anything either of them earned before, during, or after their marriage remains theirs. additionally, neither duff, 28, nor comrie, 35, are on the hook for spousal support.\n\naccording to legal documents obtained by et, the couple have also been awarded joint custody of their 3-year-old son, luca cruz comrie, even though duff initially asked for primary custody in her february 2015 divorce filing. they will also evenly split all child-rearing expenses.\n\nduff and comrie began dating in 2007, got engaged in february 2010 and tied the knot later that year, in august, during a ceremony in santa barbara. the couple welcomed luca, their only child, in march 2012.\n\nthe couple announced their amicable separation in january 2014, more than a year before duff would officially file for divorce. the actress opened up about the split in cosmopolitan last march.\n\nit wasn't working well enough to stay together, but there was still a lot of love involved, she said. it was just a slow set-in of us not being the match that we used to be. i'm lucky for the person he is and i am, and how we decided to handle this.
starbucks has crafted a brand focused not only on coffee, but also on living up to progressive ideals. now, that brand image is taking a hit following a racial bias incident at one of its stores.\n\nfewer consumers say they're as likely to buy food or drinks at starbucks (sbux) following the incident, according to new data from yougov brandindex, a service that tracks brand perception. last week, a philadelphia store manager had two black men arrested when they refused to leave after using the store's restroom without making a purchase.\n\nthe backlash from the incident -- which has sparked protests and apologies from its ceo -- caused the company's consumer perception to drop to its lowest since november 2015, when the chain got criticized for replacing a symbol-filled holiday cup with a simple red design. about 25 percent of consumers surveyed said they would consider making a purchase at starbucks on tuesday, compared with 28 percent on friday.\n\nbuzz about starbucks has also dropped into negative territory, yougov found. its buzz score, which is based on whether consumers say they've heard anything positive or negative about a brand, fell from 13 to -8 on tuesday.\n\nthere might be some people who are passing by a starbucks and might keep going, whereas before they might have stopped in, said ted marzilli, chief executive officer of data products at yougov.\n\nit's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the philadelphia arrest. however, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in los angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a los angeles store in january, even though a white man was given the entry code. neither were paying customers.\n\nit's interesting and ironic this is happening at starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, marzilli noted. it was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.\n\nby hitching itself to a progressive image, starbucks may cause consumers to be more critical of it because they're likely to expect actions that match its rhetoric. there's some sense of betrayal, marzilli said.\n\nstarbucks said it will close all of its stores on may 29 for racial bias training, which could cost the company about $7 million in lost sales.\n\nthe onus is on starbucks to follow through with things its ceo talked about, marzilli said. the store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of may is a long way away. that's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before starbucks can implement that day of training.
paul simon and art garfunkel may have been feeling groovy when they sang the 59th street bridge song all those years ago, but they've had many a rough moment since. this morning, on garfunkel's 76th birthday, rita braver talks with a rock music legend (this story was originally broadcast on november 5, 2017):\n\ncan you believe i'm still doing this?\n\nrandom house\n\nyes he is! more than 50 years after paul simon and art garfunkel first hit the pop charts, at 76 art garfunkel is touring solo.\n\nbraver asked, do you ever get tired of singing these songs, the ones that everybody wants to hear?\n\nnot really, he replied. i wouldn't do them if i didn't love them. i don't need to do this job. i do it only for love now.\n\ngarfunkel grew up in queens, n.y., his dad a salesman, his mom a homemaker.\n\nyou had two brothers, braver said. must have been pretty rambunctious in there.\n\nyeah, we fought all the time. that's what you do. what else do brothers do? they put a pillow over each other's heads, then they pound the pillow!\n\nbut garfunkel was the one with the special gift.\n\ni would sing what i heard on the radio -- 'they try to tell us we're too young,' nat king cole. and i observed about age five or six, i can sing. this is nice.\n\ndid you dream of becoming a professional singer? braver asked.\n\npaul simon and art garfunkel as tom & jerry, 1957. publicity photo\n\nnot at all, he said. i never actually thought that way until i met paul simon, when we were 11 and we met each other and practiced.\n\nthat grade school friendship would lead to one of the most popular duos in american musical history, and one of the most complicated, then and now.\n\ngarfunkel was often the lead singer, as well as arranger. but it was simon who wrote the songs that have become classics. and so, art garfunkel says, he had a purpose in writing his recent memoir, what is it all but luminous (knopf).\n\ni suppose, if i examine my inner mind, i would say, 'time to come out of the shadow of paul simon and establish yourself as a thinking artist who can sing.' i know myself to be a creative guy, and i think my profile out in show business is 'the guy over paul simon's right shoulder.'\n\nweb extra: read an excerpt from what it is all but luminous\n\nin high school, they performed as tom and jerry, but split during college, only to reunite in 1963 as simon & garfunkel.\n\ntwo years later they had a number one hit, the sounds of silence:\n\nthe hit songs and albums would keep on coming.\n\ntheir music was even used in the groundbreaking 1967 mike nichols film, the graduate.\n\nand then, nichols offered garfunkel a role in another film. he knew i wasn't an actor, but he was clever, garfunkel said. he drove by in his limo to my house on 68th street, rolls down the window and hands me a script: 'catch 22.' 'read this, artie, i see a part for you. look at nately, captain nately.'\n\nhe followed it up playing jack nicholson's best friend in carnal knowledge.\n\nleft: art garfunkel, alan arkin and martin sheen in catch-22. right: jack nicholson and art garfunkel in carnal knowledge. paramount/avco embassy\n\nbut as for simon & garfunkel? they would release their fifth and final album in 1970. as garfunkel put it in his book, the end of s&g slipped in on me. there never was an ending.\n\nbraver asked, do you have a better analysis now that you look back on it? or do you just like to think of it that way?\n\ni think the laughs were used up, he replied. we were tired of each other. all that studio togetherness, and when you finish, you have to go on tour together. when do i get a break from my funny friend? the jokes are not happening now.\n\ngarfunkel would weather some tough times. he stopped performing for a while after a brief, unhappy marriage. and later, he lost a long-time girlfriend to a drug overdose. but taking long walks helped.\n\nso did reading. i go from book to book, he said. i do about two books a month.\n\nhe's up to 1,160 books, all carefully arranged in his new york study. i told you, i'm a nutcase.\n\nart garfunkel with correspondent rita braver in the singer's library. cbs news\n\nthe study also holds photos of his family -- his two sons with second wife, kathryn, an actress and singer. they have been married since 1988.\n\nbraver asked, how did meeting her change your life?\n\ni got comfortable with life, he laughed.\n\nby then, he was also comfortable with his music again … and his old pal, paul simon. at their legendary 1981 concert in central park, half a million people cheered.\n\nto watch art garfunkel perform bridge over troubled water in the concert in central park click on the video player below:\n\nbut garfunkel, who can be fussy, saw it differently. in his book, the workaholic voted himself a c+, because i didn't get it as right as i wanted to get it.\n\nhe would have plenty of chances to get it right … two more tours with simon, and solo gigs, too.\n\nand then in february of 2010, he lost his voice.\n\nyeah, i finished touring with paul, i came home, and a month later i lost my voice, he said. my speech was very erratic. my singing was just not there.\n\nit would take four long, hard years to get it back. and today art garfunkel is savoring every moment.\n\nbut what about his relationship with his old friend? he says they are at one of their low points.\n\nyou think it'll get better? braver asked.\n\nis he watching this show? garfunkel said. paul, turn off the tv! yeah, it might. i think so. it might. we never know the future. i believe life is a surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nsee also:\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by kay lim.

vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless\n\nvice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless\n\nvice president joe biden acknowledged wednesday that the new obamacare marketplaces may not meet their original enrollment goals. still, biden -- who famously called the 2010 passage of the affordable care act a big f**king deal, said that the new marketplaces are nevertheless off to hell of a start.\n\nwe may not get to seven million, we may get to five or six, but that's a hell of a start, biden said while visiting a coffee shop in minneapolis, the minneapolis star-tribune reports. i'm here to say thanks.\n\nbiden was in minneapolis for a private democratic national committee fundraiser but stopped at moose & sadie's coffee shop specifically to talk about the affordable care act. he met with four women who were invited there to talk about the law, the star-tribune reported.\n\nthe obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace's popularity. yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in october, the significant technical problems with healthcare.gov and some state-based obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.\n\nlast week, the administration reported that nearly 3.3 million people have selected marketplace plans as of feb. 1. health and human services officials have said they are satisfied with the pace of enrollment.
treasury department spokesman tony sayegh is optimistic that tax reform, the next big push for the trump administration, can be achieved with bipartisan support.\n\ni'll be candid… one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high, sayegh said on the latest episode of the takeout podcast. and it's made us uncompetitive. i mean, that is a point that both republicans and democrats largely agree on. we're going to really tackle that tax rate.\n\nsayegh's boss, treasury secretary steven mnuchin, and national economic council director gary cohn have spent the last few months speaking with over 200 members of congress, including democrats, and hundreds of business leaders, trade associations, home builders and manufacturers in order to whip up support for their tax plan.\n\nbut how do you get at least 50 votes in the senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace obamacare failed to garner the support of all republican senators?\n\nthere is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth, sayegh argued, over a trout parmesan meal with cbs news chief white house correspondent major garrett and political director steve chaggaris. and that is the bottom line. and we again are forecasting some serious growth projections being able to be achieved if you enact tax reform.\n\nin april, the administration put out a one-page document laying out a rough blueprint of their goals: reduce seven tax brackets to three and repeal the alternative minimum and death taxes for individuals, as well as cut the business tax rate down to 15 percent. they also promised that more details would emerge in the coming months. sayegh says those are still being ironed out.\n\nfor now, the administration expects to get a cohesive bill in front of the house and senate committees of jurisdiction in the beginning of september, with mark-up completed by the first half of the month. after an effort to merge a house and senate tax reform bill together, it's going to get done by late october or november, sayegh said.\n\nit's going to get done this year. that is the emphasis, that is the focus, and that is what we have been working toward.\n\nfor more from major and steve's conversation with tony sayegh, download this week's podcast on itunes, stitcher, google play, or spotify. also, you can watch this week's episode on cbsn friday andsaturday nights at 9pm et/pt. new episodes are available via podcast every friday morning.\n\nfacebook, twitter, instagram: @takeoutpodcast\n\nemail: takeoutpodcast@cbsnews.com\n\nproduced by: arden farhi and katiana krawchenko
even as primary season continues, several senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent republicans and several incumbent democrats in danger of losing their seats. the blue wave may be coming for the house of representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the senate, where democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. here is an updated look at senate races to watch as november approaches.\n\narizona\n\n\n\nthe race to replace departing sen. jeff flake will put the theory that demographic changes are turning arizona blue to the test.\n\nphoenix-area rep. kyrsten sinema, the likely democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate democrat. according to fivethirtyeight, sinema votes in line with president trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. she is also a member of democrats' blue dog coalition, a group of more moderate congressional democrats. however, local democrats see sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state.\n\nthree republicans are vying to become the republican candidate for senate: rep. martha mcsally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand dr. kelli ward, and former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio. arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from ward, a former state senator who ran in the republican primary against sen. john mccain in 2016.\n\nsinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like ward or arpaio. however, mcsally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to sinema.\n\narizona's primary election is on august 28.\n\nflorida\n\nrepublican gov. rick scott, who is prevented from seeking a third term due to term limits, is challenging democratic sen. bill nelson in one of the country's most contentious races. state and national democrats are concerned about the prospects of victory for nelson, who has been in office since 2001.\n\nscott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.\n\npolling has shown the race to be close, with scott leading nelson by 3 percentage points in a cbs news poll from july. florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the senate.\n\nindiana\n\nsen. joe donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable democrat in the senate this election season. donnelly is running for re-election in a state mr. trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. the democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing medicare for all and abolishing u.s. immigration and customs enforcement.\n\ndonnelly is facing a challenge from mike braun, a republican business executive who sailed to his primary victory as an outsider candidate and spent $4.5 million in the final weeks of the race.\n\nmr. trump campaigned against donnelly during a may rally in elkhart, indiana, calling the incumbent sleepin' joe. meanwhile, donnelly continues to steadfastly project an image as a moderate, and even trump-friendly. in july, donnelly released an ad that quotes mr. trump's praise of the senator at a bill signing later in may.\n\nin an age of hyper-partisanship, it's unclear whether donnelly's tactics will be successful, or whether ruby-red indiana will elect a republican senator in november.\n\nmissouri\n\nsen. claire mccaskill is yet another endangered democrat seeking re-election in a state mr. trump won by an overwhelming margin. mccaskill has lucked out in her republican opponents in previous years; in 2012, the candidacy of republican todd akin was tanked by his comment that legitimate rape could not result in pregnancy.\n\nmccaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state republican party. gop gov. eric greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.\n\nmccaskill's republican opponent, state attorney general josh hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. mccaskill has also outraised hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to hawley's $1 million. early polling has generally shown mccaskill ahead, although a poll from the republican firm remington research in july showed hawley edging out mccaskill by two percentage points. mccaskill has also recently been knocked by hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour.\n\nthe november election will test mccaskill's luck, and her campaigning skills.\n\nnevada\n\nsen. dean heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only republican senator seeking re-election in a state that hillary clinton won in 2016. although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with mr. trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. in 2017, heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, which would have reportedly cost nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. heller said in august that republicans made a big mistake by tackling obamacare as their first major legislative move with trump in office.\n\nthe incumbent is facing democratic rep. jacky rosen, who was first elected in 2016 in a district that mr. trump won. however, rosen lacks name recognition across the state. early polling shows a tight race, with different polls showing either candidate ahead by one percentage point or less.\n\nnorth dakota\n\ndemocratic sen. heidi heitkamp is a major target for national republicans, although she has a relatively close relationship with mr. trump for a democrat. heitkamp was considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on air force one. mr. trump once called her a good woman. heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with mr. trump's policies.\n\nmr. trump's chumminess with heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her republican opponent, rep. kevin cramer, who has suggested that mr. trump was not targeting heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. however, in a june rally, mr. trump went after heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi.\n\neven with trump's hot-and-cold behavior, heitkamp is seriously vulnerable.\n\ntennessee\n\nrepublican sen. bob corker's departure has left tennessee open to democratic takeover. rep. marsha blackburn, the republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former gov. phil bredesen, a popular moderate democrat. bredesen is ahead of blackburn in early polling.\n\nblackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for trump, who endorsed her in may. at a rally in nashville in may, mr. trump portrayed bredesen as a tool of chuck and nancy. blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support mr. trump's agenda if elected. blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting trump's endorsement.\n\ndespite blackburn's trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. bredesen's campaign recently released an ad highlighting praise that he received from republicans when he was governor. blackburn is trying to make the election a referendum on trump, a strategy which may not work in her favor.\n\ntexas\n\nsmart money in texas is not betting that rep. beto o'rourke, the telegenic democratic congressman from el paso, will defeat sen. ted cruz. however, despite mr. trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around o'rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.\n\no'rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. he has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to cruz's $4 million. the cook political report has even rated the texas senate race as lean republican, which means they don't believe it is a lock for cruz.\n\nnonetheless, o'rourke is a long shot. no democrat has been elected statewide in texas in 20 years. as in arizona, o'rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a democrat.\n\nwest virginia\n\nsen. joe manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide democrat standing in west virginia, which voted for mr. trump by over 40 percentage points. if anywhere can truly be defined as trump country, it is west virginia, where formerly democratic gov. jim justice switched to the republican party in 2017 at a rally mr. trump.\n\nmanchin has made his reputation as a conservative democrat, voting to confirm justice neil gorsuch to the supreme court in 2017 and gina haspel as director of the central intelligence agency in 2018. he is a major target of republican efforts to get vulnerable democrats to vote for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh. manchin hasn't ruled out voting for mr. trump in 2020.\n\nhis willingness to embrace mr. trump may be enough to save manchin, who is facing republican state attorney general patrick morrisey in the general election. recent polling has shown manchin to be several points ahead of morrisey. however, if republicans - with the help of trump - are successfully able to portray manchin as just another democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly.\n\nhonorable mentions: new jersey, mississippi and california\n\nit's unlikely that democratic sen. bob menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in new jersey in november, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. after a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.\n\nmenendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. menendez will probably prevail against republican bob hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign.\n\ndemocratic sen. doug jones' victory alabama proved that the deep south is indeed vulnerable to a blue wave. sen. cindy hyde-smith was appointed to replace sen. thad cochran in april, and is now trying to win a december special election. she facing a challenge from the right from conservative state sen. chris mcdaniel. democrat mike espy, a former congressman and secretary of agriculture under president bill clinton, is also in the race.\n\nif no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if espy and mcdaniel are the top two candidates, mississippians may choose the moderate democrat over the conservative provocateur.\n\ncalifornia's senate seat will definitely remain in democratic hands. incumbent sen. dianne feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state sen. kevin de leon, who challenged feinstein from the left. however, feinstein and de leon are both on the november ballot, due to california's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.\n\ndespite decisively losing the primary, de leon was endorsed by state democratic party, and some progressives in the state hope that he can ride an insurgent campaign to victory over the 85-year-old incumbent.
a federal judge in texas ruled on friday the entire affordable care act is unconstitutional due to a recent change in federal tax law. the ruling came a day before the december 15 deadline to sign up for 2019 health coverage through the affordable care act's marketplace.\n\npeople can still sign up for coverage through saturday.\n\ncourt's decision does not affect this season's open enrollment, reads a notice on healthcare.gov, where people can sign up for coverage.\n\nthe trump white house has said that the law will remain in place for now. the ruling is certain to be appealed.\n\nwe expect this ruling will be appealed to the supreme court. pending the appeal process, the law remains in place, white house press secretary sarah sanders said in a statement.\n\nsanders said president trump is calling on congress to pass a measure that would replace the affordable care act, which is also known as obamacare. mr. trump, who campaigned on repealing the aca, said in a tweet that congress must act.\n\nnow congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy, get it done! he tweeted.\n\nsupporters of the law immediately said they would appeal. california attorney general xavier becerra expressed confidence that the ruling could be overturned, saying the aca has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the supreme court.\n\ntoday's misguided ruling will not deter us: our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all americans, said becerra, who is leading a coalition of states defending the aca.\n\na computer screen shows the enrollment page on healthcare.gov, on december 15, 2018. cbs news\n\ndemocrats will also have the majority in the house next year. democratic leader nancy pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the house of the incoming congress, said that the house will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject republicans' effort to destroy the affordable care act. this resolution would allow the house general counsel to defend the health care law on the chamber's behalf.\n\ndemocrats were able to retake the house in large part because they campaigned on health care issues, warning that republicans would try to strip away some of the more popular provisions of the aca, such as protection for pre-existing conditions. around 130 million people in the united states have pre-existing conditions, and without the aca, insurers would no longer be required to cover those conditions.\n\nif the law is invalidated, it could scrap other well-liked sections of the law, such as the part that allows parents to keep young adult children on their health care coverage until age 26.\n\nsome democrats in the house and senate support some version of medicare-for-all. progressives in congress may take the opportunity to try to pass a more comprehensive health care bill, although with republicans still controlling the senate, such a measure could die in the house.\n\nat issue in the case was the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. the penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the supreme court's decision in 2012 that the affordable care act was constitutional because of congress' ability to tax.\n\nwith no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of republican-led states, argued in the texas case. the plaintiffs also argued that the individual mandate is so essential to the entire law, so that if it's unconstitutional, the rest of the law must also be thrown out. u.s. district court judge reed o'connor agreed on that point, too.\n\njesse weber, an attorney and anchor on the law & crime network, told cbs this morning saturday that the ruling was not unexpected.\n\nthe affordable care act was all built on that penalty, weber said. the case will now likely go to the supreme court, where the five justices who previously voted to uphold the aca are still sitting. however, weber noted that the court now has a conservative majority, with the confirmation of supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh under mr. trump.\n\neveryone in 2019 is probably ok, because the appeals process takes some time, weber said.\n\ncaroline linton contributed to this report.
if the u.s. supreme court throws out the affordable care act, your finances and your future could pay the price.\n\none week after votes for the next president are cast, the supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a blockbuster dispute involving the fate of obamacare.\n\nat issue in the case brought by a group of republican-led states — which are backed by the trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate to have health insurance is unconstitutional, since congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. the justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.\n\nthe stakes are enormous — for all kinds of americans as well as the broader american economy.\n\nretiring early or starting a business might become too hazardous if your access to health insurance isn't guaranteed. you might have to wait a year before preexisting conditions are covered by an employer's plan. young adults could be kicked off their parents' policies. millions of people who buy insurance through the aca marketplaces or who now qualify for expanded medicaid coverage funded by obamacare in many states could lose their coverage as well.\n\neven if you were able to keep your health insurance, experts say you could face caps on your coverage that expose you to enormous medical bills. preventive care and birth control could cost you more. medicare beneficiaries could face higher premiums, deductibles and copays. insurers could cancel your policy retroactively for even minor mistakes on your application.\n\nin the decade since the aca became law, many americans have become so accustomed to the protections and savings afforded by the landmark legislation that they may not realize how much could change if obamacare were struck down. its effects on health care are so pervasive that nearly every american could be affected, according to the kaiser family foundation, which tracks health care issues.\n\nthe return of preexisting conditions\n\nthe trump administration and a group of republican attorneys general have asked that the entire law be thrown out. the supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on november 10 and could issue a ruling as late as june 2021.\n\nbefore the aca, insurers routinely used preexisting health conditions as a reason to deny coverage or charge people more for their insurance premiums. preexisting conditions typically included serious ailments such as cancer or heart disease as well as more common conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and obesity, and even temporary conditions including pregnancy. insurers denied about 1 in 5 applications for individual policies because of preexisting conditions, and some employer-provided group policies required people to wait up to a year before their preexisting conditions were covered.\n\nback then, many people who had health issues — or whose family members did — avoided changing jobs, starting businesses or retiring early because of the risk they couldn't find affordable health insurance.\n\npresident trump signed an executive order in september announcing a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, but the order alone can't force insurers to offer coverage if the aca is struck down.\n\nand america is a land of preexisting conditions. half of adults under age 65, or up to 133 million people, had health issues that could cause them to be denied coverage or charged exorbitant premiums, according to a 2017 government analysis.\n\nuse it — and lose it coverage\n\nhealth insurance is meant to help people pay their medical expenses and avoid potentially catastrophic bills. before obamacare, however, using your insurance could cause you to lose it.\n\nif someone with an individual insurance policy got sick, the insurer could scour the person's application looking for errors. even minor mistakes could cause the company to revoke the policy, a practice called rescission. under the aca, rescissions are allowed only if there's fraud or a material misrepresentation of facts.\n\npolicies also routinely had caps that limited how much insurers had to pay out over someone's lifetime. people who were sick enough could hit those caps and be on the hook for 100% of their medical costs afterward.\n\nother potential side effects\n\nmillions could become uninsured if the aca exchanges are shut down, obamacare's expanded medicaid coverage is rescinded, and insurers are no longer required to cover children under 26 on their parents' plans. some employers may continue dependent coverage, since young people in general tend to use less health care. but young people in poor health or with preexisting conditions could be shut out.\n\nwithout the aca, insurers could once again charge copayments or coinsurance for preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, annual checkups and birth control. medicare beneficiaries could again have to pay for certain services, including screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. the law also closed the infamous doughnut hole in medicare's prescription drug coverage that left many older people paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medication.\n\nending obamacare could increase medicare beneficiaries' costs in other ways. the aca reduced payments to medical providers and private insurers. reversing that could lead to higher deductibles and copays for part a, which covers hospital visits, and higher premiums and deductibles for part b, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.\n\non the other hand, fewer high-income beneficiaries would face premium surcharges if obamacare went away. private medicare advantage plans could reduce costs and improve coverage. also, a 0.9 percentage point increase in the payroll tax on higher-income workers would be repealed.\n\nthen again, increased medicare spending and reduced revenues will deplete the system's trust fund faster. the current insolvency date, with aca in place, is 2028; after that point, medicare's revenues won't be enough to cover all of its promised benefits.\n\nyou may not have thought america's health care system could get any more dysfunctional. if obamacare goes away, prepare to be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nliz weston is a columnist for the

nancy pelosi capped her unlikely comeback this past week surrounded by children. the california democrat was elected, once again, the speaker of the united states house of representatives, and become the most powerful woman in american history.\n\nthat's funny, isn't it? she laughed. sadly, i was hoping that we would have an american woman president just two years ago.\n\nwell, that didn't happen, said sunday morning anchor jane pauley. but speaker pelosi is the most powerful woman in american history, and the most powerful woman in american politics. but you can't make the government open?\n\nwell, the speaker has awesome power. but if the president of the united states is against governance and doesn't care whether people's needs are met or that public employees are paid or that we can have a legitimate discussion, then we have a problem, and we have to take it to the american people, she replied.\n\nspeaker nancy pelosi ushers in the 116th congress of the united states, with the children and grandchildren of legislators in attendance. cbs news\n\nspeaker pelosi ushered in a new era of divided government in the midst of a government shutdown – 800,000 federal government employees furloughed or working without pay, national parks and museums closed.\n\npresident donald trump is demanding $5.6 billion to fulfill his campaign promise of a wall along the mexico border. pelosi has vowed to block any funding to build it. a tense standoff between the president and democrats at the white house friday lasted two hours.\n\nsenate minority leader charles schumer reported the president said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years – a promise mr. trump confirmed at a press briefing later that day.\n\npauley asked pelosi, was that bluster? hyperbole?\n\nwell, i hope so, pelosi replied. but the fact is, he has said it again and again.\n\nare you recalibrating your assessment of how you can work with this president?\n\nwell, let me first say that our purpose in the meeting at the white house was to open up government, said pelosi. the impression you get from the president [is] that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish congress so the only voice that mattered was his own.\n\npelosi is described by friends and foes alike as a master legislative strategist. the first woman elected speaker of the house in 2007, she was a fierce critic of then-president george w. bush, but pelosi rounded up democratic votes to help him pass an economic bailout package.\n\npelosi again delivered the votes for the affordable care act in 2010, which republicans derisively called obamacare. that fall, they retook the house.\n\nnancy pelosi is arguably the most galvanizing and polarizing figure in politics. she would not argue, having been featured in thousands of attack ads.\n\nshe said, you go into the arena and you understand that you will be a target. and that isn't anything that should keep you out of the arena. and so i always say to women, 'just be yourself. be who you are.'\n\npauley asked, did you learn that from the experience of being a target?\n\nyeah, i think, i think so. if you're effective, you're a target. there's just no question.\n\nso, they have to undermine. but that doesn't bother me. that's their problem.\n\nthis fall she even faced a revolt from members of her own party, who called for a new generation of democratic leaders to take on president trump.\n\nat her december 11th meeting at the white house, mr. trump spoke to the press about the insurgency. nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, he said.\n\nbut going toe-to-toe in a televised standoff with the president may have helped seal the deal. she corrected the president – please don't characterize the strength that i bring to this meeting as the leader of the house democrats, who just won a big victory – and she left that meeting in shades and a flaming red power coat, making her a social media celebrity.\n\nshe'll cut your head off and you won't even know you are bleeding alexandra pelosi - about @nancypelosi #speakerpelosi pic.twitter.com/fkdxg9eqou — ryan graney (@ryanegraney) january 2, 2019\n\nthe result? on thursday, many of her staunchest critics ended up casting votes for pelosi.\n\ncounting votes is in her blood. she was born the daughter of a congressman, later the longtime mayor of baltimore, tom d'alesandro. nancy was the youngest of seven, and the only girl.\n\nmarried at 23, she had five children. while active in politics, she didn't begin a political career until age 47.\n\nshe said, when my youngest daughter, alexandra, was going into senior year, i [said], 'alexandra, mommy has a chance to run for congress. but you have one more year at home, so i'm hesitant to do that. if you don't think i should go, i won't, and i'm happy with that decision.' and she said, 'mother, get a life!' what teenage girl wouldn't want her mother out of the house three nights a week!\n\nwell, i had never heard the expression, 'get a life,' but then i did! she laughed.\n\nthree decades later, she once again has the top job in congress, with the best view in washington – from a capitol on edge.\n\njane pauley with speaker nancy pelosi, with a view from the speaker's office. cbs news\n\npauley asked her, will the next congress be remembered for impeachment, or will they be remembered for something else?\n\nwell, we will talk about what we talked about in the campaign for the people: lower healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs and preserving pre-existing condition benefit; building bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of america.\n\nso, impeachment not high on your agenda?\n\nwell, that would be depending on what comes forth from the special counsel's office. if and when the time comes for impeachment, it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way, pelosi said.\n\non thursday, the president had kind words for pelosi. i just want to start off by congratulating nancy pelosi on being elected speaker of the house, he said. it's a very, very great achievement. i think it's actually going to work out. i think it'll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking.\n\nspeaker nancy pelosi talks with president donald trump in the situation room friday, january 4, 2018, during negotiations over re-opening the u.s. government. cbs news\n\npauley said, president trump hasn't given you a nickname, that i know of.\n\nthat i know of, no!\n\nand to me, it means one of two things; either he doesn't regard you that seriously, that you need a 'gotta cut her down' nickname, or that he has some respect for you.\n\nwell, in either case it doesn't matter to me, pelosi laughed. what matters to me is that he recognize that the congress of the united states is the first branch of government, that we're a co-equal branch of government, and that we represent the people. and that when we go to the table to speak with him, we're respectful of the branch that he represents, the office of the president. and we want him to be respectful of the branch of government we represent. co-equal.\n\nso, you have to remind him of that periodically?\n\nno. i don't know. we'll see. we shall see. it isn't so much about him. it's about the office that he holds, the presidency of the united states. sometimes i think i respect the office he holds more than he does.\n\nas the first woman elected speaker of the house, her place in history was already secure. but her defining role in history may lie ahead of her.\n\nshe said, if hillary clinton had won and the affordable care act would be safe, i would've been happy to go home. i have options!\n\nyou would have retired?\n\nyeah, well, i don't know if i would retire. i would've gone home. yeah, i see my role as more of a mission than job tenure. and when the mission is accomplished, then i can have that satisfaction that when i was needed to get the job done, i was there to do it.\n\nnancy pelosi poses with female members of congress. cbs news\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by mark hudspeth.
with the supreme court poised to decide the future of the affordable care act and the senate set to confirm president trump's third appointee to the high court, judge amy coney barrett, health care was a key topic during thursday night's debate. mr. trump and democratic nominee joe biden were asked to detail their health care plans should the justices vote to kill the obama-era health care law.\n\nbiden said he would push for a version of the affordable care act that includes a public option, deeming it bidencare. biden said his health care proposal would also allow medicare to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies and reduce premiums.\n\nhe's never come up with a plan, the former vice president said. i guess we're going to get the pre-existing conditions plan at the same time we'll get the infrastructure plan.\n\nbiden conceded his plan will cost $750 billion over 10 years, but will reduce prescription drug prices and address surprise billing.\n\nmr. trump said the public option means socialized medicine.\n\nhe's talking about destroying your medicare and destroying your social security, and this whole country will come down, the president said.\n\nbiden pushed back, though, and stressed he split from the democratic presidential candidates who supported medicare for all, including his running mate senator kamala harris, who was his rival in the democratic primaries.\n\nhe's a very confused guy, biden said. he thinks he's running against somebody else. he's running against joe biden. i beat all those other people because i disagree with them.\n\nfor his part, mr. trump criticized the aca and praised republicans in congress for excising the individual mandate from the law. he also said he asked his administration to run [obamacare] as well as you can, and said the cost of premiums have declined.\n\nbut if the supreme court finds the individual mandate unconstitutional and rules the rest of obamacare cannot stand without the provision, mr. trump said he would put forth a brand new, beautiful health care plan — without offering any specifics.\n\nalways protecting people with pre-existing [conditions], the president said. we're going to do even better.\n\nmr. trump declined to put forth additional details. he has long promised to unveil a replacement for the aca but has not done so.\n\ndemocrats have raised concerns that, if confirmed to the supreme court, barrett would vote to overturn the aca. she has previously criticized chief justice john roberts' 2012 ruling upholding the law. during her confirmation hearings last week, barrett declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of the law, since there is a case on the aca is pending before the supreme court.\n\nhowever, the president has repeatedly said he wants the court to overturn the law. barrett is expected to be confirmed by the senate next week, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court.
mitt romney speaks on health care at the university of michigan, may 12, 2011.\n\nin an attempt to address perhaps his greatest political vulnerability, likely 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney on thursday said there are clear differences between the health care law he signed into law as massachusetts governor and the obamacare federal health care law disdained by republicans.\n\nromney said that while pundits have been pushing him to simply admit his decision to sign the massachusetts law was a boneheaded mistake, he would not do so. that's because, he said, it wouldn't be honest.\n\nsigning the law, romney said, was right for the people of my state.\n\nyet he argued that what was right for his state is not necessarily right for the nation. romney grounded his argument in the founding fathers' vision for america, saying they didn't want a king-like structure grounded in a central government but rather for americans to have the freedom to choose our life's course, our enterprises.\n\nthe founders, he said, chose for american power to be grounded in the states, and codified that impulse in the 10th amendment.\n\nthe obama administration, he said, citing the health care law, fundamentally doesn't believe in that american experiment. the administration distrusts the idea that states are where the power of government resides, he added.\n\ngerardo mora/getty images\n\nromney said that our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in a one sized fits all plan across the nation.\n\nromney, who has been stung by charges of flip-flopping in the past, said his federal health care proposal had not changed from 2008, when he last ran for president -- even though his decision to sign the law has seemingly gone from a political asset to a liability.\n\nthe plan i'm going to describe for you is the same, he said. i'm not adjusting the plan to reflect the political sentiment.\n\nspeaking at the university of michigan, romney defended the individual mandate in the massachusetts plan, saying it was necessary to address the free rider problem of state residents declining to buy health care and then showing up at hospitals for care, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\nhe cast the pre-mandate system as the big government approach, since paying for care fell to taxpayers. he contrasted that with the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty, which he cast as the personal responsibility option.\n\nromney then offered the outlines of his federal health care proposal, which, he said, would start with an executive order on his first day as president to help states get waivers to opt-out of the federal health care law. referring to slides, he said he would then look to repeal and replace that law with his proposal.\n\nthere are five planks in romney's proposal. the first is to give more power to states through medicaid block grants, more flexibility in dealing with the ill and uninsured and limits on federal standards.\n\nthe second is plank is to empower individual ownership, in part by giving a tax deduction to those who buy their own insurance. the third is to focus federal regulation, partially by allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\ncnbc\n\nthe fourth is to limit medical malpractice lawsuits. and the fifth is to make health care more competitive in part through co-insurance products that give consumers more of a stake in the overall cost of their care.\n\nromney said that more specifics about the plan would be forthcoming. but he argued that overall it lowered costs and meant less government spending than the obama plan, which he cast as a tax-raising, costly bureaucratic nightmare that forces an un-american federal mandate on the american people.\n\nrick santorum, one of romney's likely rivals, released a statement immediately following the speech deeming the massachusetts health care law the precursor to national socialized medicine.\n\nboth romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden, he said. romneycare has, in fact, not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts. it's done just the opposite. this is not a failure of execution, but a lack of foresight on governor romney's part to understand the implications of his policy proposals. we need leaders who believe in the american people again, not the power of government to solve our problems.\n\nduring a question and answer period following romney's address, he said the massachusetts law wasn't perfect, adding that there were a number of things the state could have done differently. but he said he was proud that he signed a law that helped get residents insured and was in the interest of the people of massachusetts.\n\nin advance of the speech, which the romney campaign billed as major, the conservative wall street journal editorial page hammered the massachusetts republican on the issue, writing: mr. romney now claims obamacare should be repealed, but his failure to explain his own role or admit any errors suggests serious flaws both in his candidacy and as a potential president.\n\n\n\nthose on the left, meanwhile, pointed to romney's past statements seemingly in support of a federal mandate, including a 1994 statement that he would back a federal bill that included a mandate. in 2007, romney said that once states try out their own plans, we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach.\n\n\n\nthe individual mandate is at the center of conservative constitutional challenges to the health care law.
just what kind of health insurance do federal judges and supreme court justices have?\n\nthat question seems fair to ask in light of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's ruling on friday striking down the affordable care act -- the 2010 law passed under president barack obama that expanded health insurance to millions of americans -- as unconstitutional. o'connor's decision looks certain to be appealed by a group of democratic state attorneys general, first to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit and then likely to the supreme court.\n\nwhile the aca's ultimate fate may depend on those courts, here's what to know about the health coverage federal judges and supreme court justices can typically expect.\n\nhundreds of plans to choose from\n\n\n\nlike the vast majority of federal employees of all ranks, the government's judges have the option of enrolling in plans offered by the federal employee health benefits system. it includes hundreds of plan choices throughout the u.s. -- far more than even the largest private employers. many plan options also have broad networks of providers, often nationwide.\n\nso finding coverage for specialists and out-of-network services isn't as tough a problem for judges as it can be in the often narrow networks aca enrollees rely on. and federal employees have the option of keeping their coverage into retirement, unlike many private employer plans.\n\nstill, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or supreme court justice would get. unlike the so-called cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nlike any employer offering health insurance, the federal government pays a good portion of employees' premiums. except for some negotiated union contracts with postal workers, the feds generally pay about 72 percent of premium costs. but that's less than the average 80 percent that private sector employers kick in.\n\neven judges pay premiums\n\n\n\nthat means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. they may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. in addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. as in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.\n\nbut recall the biggest difference: feds have dramatically more choices than most employees or people shopping the aca marketplaces for coverage.\n\nplus, with an annual salary of $255,300 for associate supreme court justices, this elite group of jurists likely doesn't feel the pain of out-of-pocket costs as much as the average aca recipient. the high court doesn't disclose how many justices opt for the federal employees health benefits program. they are allowed to receive coverage elsewhere, such as through a spouse's plan.\n\nwhatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. after all, we've been here before. the supreme court upheld the aca in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. but now that the trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.\n\nthe bigger the pool, the better\n\n\n\nstill, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. that's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. the large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.\n\nit's an ideal situation, one that the aca tried to replicate in many ways.\n\nnow, though, the fate of an estimated 20 million americans covered under the aca lies in the hands of these well-covered judges. judge o'connor's friday ruling that the aca is unconstitutional came in response to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of republican governors and state attorneys general.\n\nthe decision doesn't affect people currently insured in the aca marketplaces or those who have just signed up for 2019 coverage. ultimately, however, if the ruling holds it would dismantle the entire law -- that includes many of the popular aca components such as protections for people with preexisting conditions, mandated coverage of essential health benefits and zero-cost preventive care. medicaid expansion coverage under the aca would also be in jeopardy.\n\nthe judges, of course, would still have their federal coverage.
10:37 p.m. et the debate has ended. trump and clinton just shook hands -- they didn't at the beginning.\n\n10:34 p.m. et the last question came from an uncommitted voter in the audience. he asked the candidates if they can name one positive thing that each respects about the other.\n\ni respect his children, clinton said, adding that it says a lot about trump. i don't agree with nearly anything else he does or says.\n\ntrump said that her comment was a great compliment.\n\nhe added, she doesn't quit. she doesn't give up. i respect that. she's a fighter.\n\nrepublican u.s. presidential

take to meet americans' needs while limiting job losses and not damaging the environment.\n\ni will bring our energy companies back, said trump, who added that the epa is so restrictive it's putting energy companies out of business.\n\nclinton said, we've got to remain energy independent. she said she has a comprehensive energy plan that includes fighting climate change.\n\n10:29 p.m. et clinton said that she respects the 2nd amendment, but wants comprehensive background checks, to close the gun show loophole and charleston loophole.\n\n10:25 p.m. et candidates are asked what they would prioritize as the most important aspect of picking a supreme court justice.\n\nclinton said she wants to choose someone who understands the way the world really works and people who have real-life experience.\n\nshe added that she wants the supreme court to reverse citizens united, to understand that voting rights is still a big country in parts of the country and she wants the high court to respect the roe v. wade ruling.\n\nclinton slammed senate republicans for not taking up president obama's nominee of merrick garland to fill the vacant seat on the supreme court, and vowed to immediately move to ensure that we fill that if elected president.\n\ntrump said he has already proposed 20 possible nominees and said he would pick people who respect the constitution and the 2nd amendment.\n\n10:21 p.m. et trump is asked if his recent tweet referring a sex tape involving former miss universe alicia machado shows that he has strong discipline, but he seemed to deny talking about one and then talked about clinton's role as secretary of state during the 2012 benghazi attack.\n\nhere's the tweet:\n\ndid crooked hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) alicia m

help members of the black community and hispanic community.\n\nif she's president of the united states, nothing is ever going to happen...she's all talk. it doesn't get done.\n\nclinton said she started off as a young lawyer working to fight discrimination against black children in schools.\n\ni have a deep devotion...to making sure that every american feels that he or she has a place in our

american ground forces in syria, clinton said. i think that would be a very serious mistake. i don't think that american troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. i don't think that would be a smart strategy.\n\n10:10 p.m. et martha raddatz said that his running mate, mike pence, recently said that the u.s. should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the assad regime and that provocations by russia need to be met with american strength.\n\nhe and i haven't spoken, and i disagree, trump said.\n\n10:07 p.m. et trump said that clinton talks tough about russia and the u.s. nuclear program has fallen way behind.\n\nrussia is new in terms of nuclear. we are old, we are tired, we are exhausted in terms of nuclear, trump said.\n\nshe talks tough against putin and assad, he added. every time we take rebels, we're arming people...they end up being worse than the people...almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.\n\n10:04 p.m. et candidates are asked from an undecided voter what they would do if elected president about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo since it's reminiscent of the holocaust and the u.s. waiting too long back then to take action.\n\nthe situation in syria is catastrophic, clinton said, adding that she advocates a no-fly zone in syria to provide humanitarian aid to people suffering and to work with allies.\n\nclinton said she supports an investigation of the russians and syrians committing war crimes in

the children's health insurance fund, which has provided health insurance to 8 million kids, she said.\n\nclinton added that she worked to change the adoption and foster care system and she worked to rebuild new york after 9/11 and get healthcare for first responders.\n\nshe added, four-hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it.\n\n9:58 p.m. et anderson cooper asked trump if it was true that he posted a $916 million loss in his 1995 tax returns and he seemed to admit that he did, explaining that a lot of my write-off was depreciation.\n\nof course i do, trump said. her donors took massive write-offs.\n\ni understand the tax code better than anyone who's ever run for president, he said. i pay tax and i pay federal tax, too.\n\n9:54 p.m. et candidates are asked what specific tax provisions they will change to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. trump said he will cut taxes for the middle class, while he said clinton will raise everybody's classes massively.\n\ntrump said he would do away with carried interest, which he said helps the wealthy.\n\nhe lives in an alternative reality, clinton said. his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had.\n\nclinton alluded to the fact that trump might not have paid federal income taxes for up to 18 years, according to a recent new york times report about trump's 1995 tax returns.\n\n9:49 p.m. et martha raddatz said the leaked emails of clinton campaign chairman john podesta showed excerpts from clinton's paid speeches to wall street and that clinton said you need both a public and private position on certain issues. uncommitted voters asked if it's okay for politicians to be too-faced.\n\nclinton said that she was alluding to steven spielberg's movie about abraham lincoln. she said that in order to get the congress to approve the 13th amendment, clinton said he used a principled and strategic approach in which he used an argument with one group of people and another argument with another group of people.\n\nthat was a great display of presidential leadership, she said.\n\nclinton then began to shift the subject to news about the u.s. intelligence community accusing russia of hacking into u.s. political groups in an effort to undermine the election. she went on to accuse trump of having ties to russia and called on trump to release his tax returns. he said he'll release them when his audit is over.\n\n9:46 p.m. et clinton said that trump has repeatedly lied about not initially supporting the war in iraq even though that claim has been debunked.\n\nthat has not been debunked, trump responded.\n\nit has, in fact, been debunked. he said it on howard stern's radio show.\n\n9:42 p.m. et martha raddatz said that trump's running mate, mike pence recently said that trump's proposed muslim ban from last december is no longer their campaign's position. asked if that's correct, trump said, first of all, captain khan is an american hero.\n\nthe muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into some extreme vetting for certain areas of the world, trump said.\n\nasked again if the muslim ban is no longer his proposal, trump said, it's called extreme vetting.\n\nclinton said, we will have vetting that's as tough as it needs to be, but then she asked about trump's policy about banning people based on a religion, how do we do that?\n\nare we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? clinton said, adding that what trump has said was extremely unwise and dangerous.\n\nwhat donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, she said.\n\ndemocratic u.s. presidential nominee hillary clinton is seen during her presidential town hall debate against republican u.s. presidential

to combat islamophobia that's on the rise.\n\nthat's a shame, trump said, but he added that, there is a problem.\n\nwhether we like it or not, there is a problem, he said. we have to be sure that muslims come in and they report what's going on.\n\ntrump claimed that in san bernardino last year many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.\n\nif they don't [report], it's a very difficult situation for our country, trump said.\n\nclinton said that there have been some divisive, dark things said about muslims. she added that his demagogic behavior is dangerous and his rhetoric plays into the hands of the terrorists.\n\n9:35 p.m. et clinton was asked to address her husband's comments from this past week about obamacare being a crazy system. the former president later clarified the comment and said he supports the system.\n\nduring the debate, clinton defended president obama's signature healthcare law and said, 20 million people have health insurance.\n\ntrump is asked how he would replace obamacare. he said the u.s. would have so much competition in the insurance industry. he said he's going to block grant into the states.\n\n9:29 p.m. et an uncommitted missouri voter asked what the candidates will do to bring the cost down of healthcare and make costs better. clinton and trump argued over who would answer first. trump said, i'm a gentleman, and he let clinton answer first.\n\nclinton said she would save what works and what's good about obamacare and provide additional help to small businesses.\n\nif we repeal it as donald has proposed and start over again, all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody, she said.\n\ntrump said clinton wants to move to a single-payer plan like canada's. he added that it should be repealed and replaced.\n\n9:28 p.m. et trump wanted to stay on the issue of emails, but clinton wanted to move on to additional questions from voters. clinton said trump was trying to divert attention from the video of his lewd comments.\n\n9:25 p.m. et martha raddatz asked clinton if it was extremely careless of her to operate a personal email server as secretary of state in which 110 classified emails were exchanged.\n\nthat was a mistake. i take responsibility for using a personal email account. obviously if i were to do it over again, i would not, she said. i am very sorry about that.\n\nclinton said there's no evidence that classified information was hacked and ended up in the wrong hands.\n\n9:22 p.m. et trump said that clinton owes an apology for her thousands of missing emails. he then said, if i win, i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\n\nthere has never been so many lies, so much deception, he said.\n\n9:20 p.m. et clinton responded by repeating a line from michelle obama's 2016 democratic national convention speech, when they go low, we go high.\n\nclinton went on to say trump never apologized for mocking a new york times reporter's disability or to president obama for spreading the birther conspiracy -- that he was not born in the u.s.\n\nclinton said trump needs to give mr. obama an apology as well as the rest of the country.\n\n9:18 p.m. et the next question came from a guy named jeff from ohio on facebook. jeff asked: trump said the campaign has changed him. when did that happen? martha raddatz piggybacked onto the question and asked when trump walked off the bus on access hollywood at age 59, was he a different man then and did that behavior change?\n\nthat was locker room talk. i'm not proud of it. i am a person who has great respect for people, my family, the people of this country, trump said.\n\ntrump then brought up president bill clinton's past infidelities.\n\nwhen you look at bill clinton, he said, there has never been anyone in the history of this nation...who has been so abusive to women.\n\n9:16 p.m. et after clinton outlined how she would help americans, including minorities across the u.s., trump said, it's just words, folks. it's just words.\n\n9:14 p.m. et clinton responded and said with prior gop presidential nominees, she has disagreed with them on policies, but she said, i have never questioned their fitness to serve. donald trump is different.\n\nclinton said back in june, she said trump was not fit to be president and commander in chief.\n\nwhat we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women, clinton said. i think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.\n\nshe went on to say that trump has insulted women and members of other communities throughout the campaign.\n\n9:11 p.m. et trump is asked by anderson cooper if he understood that he bragged about engaging in sexual assault in his comments from 2005 that surfaced on friday.\n\nno, i didn't say that at all, trump said. i don't think you understand what i said...this was locker room talk.\n\ni apologize to my family and i certainly apologize to the american people, added trump, who then started talking about isis.\n\npressed further to say whether he had actually engaged in such behavior, trump claimed he hasn't.\n\n9:07 p.m. et a voter in the audience asked if the candidates can display appropriate behavior for youth. clinton, who won the coin toss to answer first, said it is very important for americans to make clear to children that our country is really great because we're good.\n\nwe are going to respect one another, lift each other up, said clinton, who added that she will be looking for ways to embrace diversity.\n\nshe said she has a positive and optimistic view of the country's direction.\n\ni agree with everything she said, said trump, who added that he is actually a politician.\n\ntrump, however, slammed obamacare, the situation involving trade and the u.s. border.\n\nwe have to bring back respect to law enforcement, he said.\n\n9:05 p.m. et both candidates entered the debate hall. the candidates didn't shake each other's hands.\n\n9:04 p.m. et moderators cnn's anderson cooper and abc news' martha raddatz are kicking off the debate now.\n\n9:03 p.m. et check out our live-blog of fact-checking throughout the debate tonight.\n\n8:52 p.m. et the debate -- a town hall meeting -- will begin in just a few minutes around 9 p.m. et.\n\n7:35 p.m. et donald trump just delivered a pre-debate statement with women who have accused president bill clinton of sexual assault or rape including juanita broaddrick. full story to come on cbsnews.com.\n\nhe shared the statement via a facebook live feed.\n\njoin me in st. louis, missouri - as i conclude my debate prep. posted by donald j. trump on sunday, october 9, 2016\n\nhillary clinton's communications director, jennifer palmieri, issued a statement on the event.\n\nwe're not surprised to see donald trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. hillary clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. if donald trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. as always, she's prepared to handle whatever donald trump throws her way.\n\n7:30 p.m. et the second general election debate between hillary clinton and donald trump is slated to kick off in about 90 minutes on the campus of washington unviersity in st. louis, missouri.\n\nthe debate comes about two weeks after the two nominees last faced off at their first debate and after major revelations have surfaced about trump's past.\n\nsince the video of trump making lewd comments in 2005 surfaced friday, many republicans have either condemned their nominee, withdrawn their endorsements or called for him to drop out of the race to allow mike pence to take over. trump released a video late friday attempting to apologize for his comments, but it didn't go far enough for many republicans.\n\nsince the first debate, the new york times has also reported that trump's 1995 tax returns, which it obtained, show that he posted a $916 million loss that year, which means he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.\n\nmeanwhile, wikileaks on friday leaked hundreds of emails that were hacked from some of the email accounts of john podesta, clinton's campaign chairman. one of the emails showed excerpts of clinton's speeches to goldman sachs.
with polls showing the democratic race tightening in the crucial leadoff states of iowa and new hampshire, chelsea clinton on tuesday took aim at bernie sanders -- her mother's chief rival for the nomination -- saying that sanders would dismantle the health care system as we know it.\n\nchelsea clinton, daughter of u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, participates in a panel discussion about early childhood education while campaigning for her mother in concord, new hampshire, january 12, 2016. reuters/brian snyder reuters\n\nclinton was campaigning in new hampshire on behalf of her mother, hillary clinton, ostensibly to tout the campaign's early childhood education plan. but she took sharp aim at sanders, who advocates for a single-payer system that would place control of health care in the hands of the federal government.\n\ni never thought we would be arguing about the affordable care act, or obamacare, in the democratic primary, clinton told democrats in manchester, one of three stops she made during her swing.\n\nshe said sanders would dismantle obamacare, the children's health insurance program, and medicare -- along with private insurance programs.\n\nclinton went even further, arguing that sanders' plan would empower republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income americans.\n\nsen. sanders wands to devolve the authority to set up state health insurance programs to individual state governors, clinton continued. now maybe if i lived in a place like new hampshire, with your governor, i would feel okay about that. but if i lived in a state that had a republican governor, particularly a republican governor who already turned down medicaid expansion matching funds, i don't think i would be comfortable, right? because i don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again.\n\nclinton also said her mother has a plan to pay for her higher-education proposals, unlike sanders, who proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. clinton has also proposed to make tuition at two-year and four-year public universities free.\n\nshe also, unlike sen. sanders, has articulated how she's going to pay for that proposal, chelsea clinton said of hillary clinton's plan.\n\ncurrently, there's a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what sen. sanders has proposed and how he's articulated paying for those proposals, clinton said. so that, to me, is troubling.\n\nlater, at a stop in portsmouth, clinton made a trip to g. wilikers toy store where she perused children's books for her 15-month old daughter, charlotte.\n\nclinton scooped up several books and a crochet owl hat to bring back to new york before heading over to the portsmouth brewery to host her final town hall of the day, where she faced a question about her mother's ties with wall street.\n\nshe has such a complex and nuanced plan, clinton said after referencing her mother's record from when she was a new york senator. that's why paul krugman and others have said hers goes the farthest to regulate and rein in wall street and to increase the chance that we will never have 2008 ever again.
president trump was in the spotlight tuesday night for a rare town hall in philadelphia with undecided voters, where he fielded questions on topics including the coronavirus pandemic and health care, which have been on the minds of many voters.\n\nhe made a variety of claims about the health care system, health care proposals and the scientific realities of covid-19. here are some of the highlights, as well as fact checking and context for his statements.\n\nmr. trump repeated a claim tuesday night he has made in the past — that covid-19 is probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine but would go away without the vaccine.\n\nwhen abc news moderator george stephanopoulos asked the president to clarify if he believes the virus will go away without a vaccine, mr. trump responded, sure, over a period of time.\n\nmr. trump said in february that the 15 coronavirus cases in the u.s. would soon be zero. he's also said repeatedly that the virus will eventually disappear, without citing evidence.\n\nbut public medical experts think this strain of coronavirus may be here to stay.\n\nabsent a vaccine, i think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with, bill hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at harvard university's school of public health, told usa today earlier this year. it is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory virai infections.\n\na new review in frontiers in public health says covid-19 will likely become seasonal eventually.\n\nmr. trump, who has not followed through on a pledge in july that he would have a health care plan ready and signed in two weeks, said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the affordable care act. he was responding to ellesia blaque, an assistant professor who lives in philadelphia, who told him she's paying $7,000 a year for life-saving medicine because of a condition she was born with, sarcoidosis.\n\nthat disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when i went to graduate school, into my brain, she said.\n\ni want to know what it is that you're going to do assure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we're supposed to do, can stay insured, she asked mr. trump.\n\nso first of all, you are taken seriously. i hope you are, he responded. and we are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. we're not going to hurt preexisting conditions. and, in fact, just the opposite.\n\nbut while the president has claimed he would protect preexisting conditions, his administration has been trying to kill the affordable care act in the courts.\n\nin june, the trump administration asked the supreme court to overturn obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so, the rest of the law, which includes preexisting condition protections, should be struck down.\n\nwhen stephanopoulos pointed this out to the president, mr. trump responded, doesn't matter. i have it already, and it's a much better plan for you, and it's a much better plan.\n\nwhile he said he has the plan already, stephanopoulos noted that mr. trump has been in office for 3 1/2 years and has not yet presented a plan to replace obamacare.\n\nmr. trump said this summer that he was working on an executive order to protect those with preexisting conditions.\n\nit's still unclear when that health care plan, which mr. trump said would be signed weeks ago, will be released. white house chief of staff mark meadows said the plan has a legislative component and an executive action component.\n\nmr. trump also claimed herd mentality will help rid the u.s. of the virus.\n\nand you'll develop — you'll develop herd — like a herd mentality — it's going to be herd developed — and that's going to happen, the president said tuesday night. that will all happen. but with a vaccine i think it will go away very quickly. but i really believe we're rounding the corner. and i believe that strongly.\n\nstephanopoulos pointed out that dr. anthony fauci disagrees with this, but mr. trump insisted other doctors like scott atlas agree with him.\n\nthe reality of a herd immunity, which appears to be what the president meant by herd mentality, is not so clear. the scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection, which seem to make it possible to be reinfected.\n\nthe herd immunity strategy would also yield far more deaths, as stephanopoulos pointed out.\n\nthe president claimed he in fact up-played covid-19, after telling washington post journalist bob woodward he always wanted to play it down.\n\ni didn't downplay it. i actually in many ways up-played it in action, the president told the voter who asked him why he would downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.\n\nthe president has long cited his move to restrict travel from china as one of those actions. but the president was also slower on other needed measures.\n\nfor weeks, reporters pressed him on using the defense production act to ramp up production of much-needed medical supplies before the president took action. he also claimed the virus would go from 15 cases down to zero quickly, and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear. he has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing a mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of covid-19.\n\nmr. trump, who typically forgoes wearing a mask himself, said there are a lot of people who think that masks are not good. a voter had asked why he doesn't wear a mask more often himself and why he hasn't imposed a national mask mandate.\n\nnow there is — by the way, a lot of people don't want to wear masks, he said. there are a lot of people think the masks are not good. and there are a lot of people that as an example —\n\nasked who those people are, the president responded that masks aren't good for waiters.\n\nbut mask-wearing has proven to decrease the likelihood of transmission of covid-19. centers for disease control director robert redfield went as far to suggest in congressional testimony wednesday that masks might be more effective in fighting the virus than a vaccine for some americans.\n\nthe cdc says masks are most likely to reduce the spread of covid-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.\n\ni might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when i take a covid vaccine, redfield said wednesday. ... if i don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. this face mask will.\n\nmr. trump also said tuesday night that biden has agreed to a bernie sanders-style health care plan. if you look at what they (democrats) want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of pre-existing conditions.\n\nwhile biden and sanders did release a platform to ensure universal health care, it is not sanders' medicare for all plan. the platform recommends an affordable and government-run public option health care plan to be made available through the obamacare exchanges.\n\nbiden's own proposal calls for building on the affordable care act and for increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums for americans. biden's plan would also offer coverage premium-free to individuals who would qualify under medicaid expansion, but whose states have chosen not to expand medicaid.\n\nbet noted that the uncommitted african americans who asked mr. trump questions at the philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on a range of topics from health care to inequality. blaque, the voter suffering from sarcoidosis, told cnn later that the president did not answer her question, and she's now decided who's getting her vote.\n\ni'm going to vote for biden, she said.
tuesday is the last day to sign up for obamacare in 36 states, while another 14 and washington, d.c. have later dates. the federal health insurance program — accessible at healthcare.gov — has seen a crush of signups as the open enrollment deadline approaches, and coronavirus cases continue to surge.\n\nover 915,000 people signed up for obamacare from november 29 to december 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the centers for medicare & medicaid services' weekly enrollment snapshot. that's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year.\n\naccording to cms, about 8.3 million people enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled in the program during the 2020 open enrollment period, over 2 million of whom were new consumers. and, as of june 2019, 14 million people who were made newly eligible for coverage under the aca's medicaid expansion, adopted by 39 states, enrolled in coverage, according to data from the kaiser family foundation.\n\nmore than 300,000 people have now died from the coronavirus in the u.s., according to data from johns hopkins university. the u.s. has set records for covid-19 hospitalizations for eight days in a row, and the number of patients requiring intensive care is up 80% from a month ago.\n\ncoverage for those who make the deadline will begin january 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, president trump, leaves office. mr. trump campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.\n\nin june, when close to half a million americans had lost health insurance through their employer due to the economic shutdown brought on by the pandemic, the trump administration urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act, which authorized obamacare. by august, the number of americans who had lost their health insurance jumped to six million — or, at least 12 million when spouses and children are taken into account, according to research from the economic policy institute.\n\nat the center of the case before the supreme court is the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate, an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire aca unconstitutional.\n\nthat argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the supreme court. last month, chief justice john roberts and justice brett kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by president trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the republican-led states.\n\nroberts said he believes that if congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the supreme court job's to do so. it's hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act, roberts told texas solicitor general kyle hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law.\n\na final decision from the court is expected by june.\n\nanalysts and advocates who follow obamacare sign-ups say interest in the program has only grown stronger as the coronavirus pandemic holds its grip on the nation, the associated press reports.\n\npresident-elect joe biden has nominated california attorney general xavier becerra to serve as his first secretary of health and human services. becerra was a leading advocate for passage of the aca as california's attorney general, and has defended the law in federal court, including before the supreme court.
it wasn't a matter of if, but more like how much. health care analysts and actuaries have been predicting for weeks now that affordable care act exchange members would likely see premium increases for 2017 around 10 percent on average.\n\npreliminary reporting shows those predictions are accurate. in a study of 14 major metro areas by the kaiser family foundation, premiums for the second-lowest-cost silver medical plans (the plans that tax credits are based on) are expected to rise an average of 11 percent in 2017. in the cities kaiser studied, complete data was available on insurer premium change requests. it found the changes range from a decrease of 13 percent in providence, rhode island, to an increase of 18 percent in portland, oregon.\n\nthe situation is dire for low-income consumers. according to a commonwealth fund study released thursday, low-income adults who qualify for medicaid under the affordable care act but live in a state that hasn't expanded medicaid will likely pay higher out-of-pocket costs for less comprehensive insurance coverage.\n\nthe kaiser analysis also shows that so far, marketplace premiums are rising faster for 2017 then they have in years past.\n\nwhy?\n\na major factor relates to one of obamacare's greatest strengths. now that people with preexisting conditions qualify for coverage, insurers may have underestimated the amount of health care services these people need. in addition, special subsidies given to insurers in the beginning of obamacare have come to an end. that's on top of rising health care costs in general, especially prescription drug costs.\n\nadded dave dillon, fellow at the society of actuaries: insurers developed rates for the exchanges back in 2014 with no data. at best it was an educated guess, he explained. it's no wonder lots of insurers underestimated their costs.\n\npremium increases are also expected to hit employer-sponsored plans in 2017, but employers often offset those rises by passing on the costs to employees in the form of higher deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket payments.\n\nwhat can you do if you're looking at a big jump in your premium?\n\ncheck, check and check again if you qualify for a subsidy. the government estimates that 87 percent of people who buy marketplace plans can receive a subsidy or premium tax credit to help lower costs. check with healthcare.gov and update your income information each year to make sure you're getting the assistance you qualify for.\n\nbe willing to change plans. true, all the jumping around in the marketplaces is making it hard for insurers to estimate costs going forward, but from the consumer perspective, this is one of the best options you have to keep premiums down.\n\nwhile many insurers have put in requests to raise premiums, a lot of marketplaces have new entrants that are offering competitive or below-market rates. that's why it's so important to shop the exchanges every open-enrollment period.\n\nin addition, consumers should be willing to drop a metal level to save money, advised dillon. according to his calculations, consumers can save approximately 15 percent in premium costs by shifting from gold to silver, or from silver to bronze plans. such a drop will likely mean more out-of-pocket costs, so based on your health care needs, you'll have to calculate if the savings on premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs makes sense.\n\nknow your options. having a thorough knowledge of your exchange options can help you when it comes to applying for subsidies. individual exchanges often change their benchmark plans -- those that qualify for government subsidies. if you stay in your plan from the previous year thinking it will still be the benchmark plan, but then the benchmark plan shifts to a different carrier, you may lose your subsidy.
in an unprecedented maryland election, three polling centers will be open tuesday in a special election between democrat kweisi mfume and republican kimberly klacik in a congressional race dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nofficials have been urging the electorate to vote by mail for weeks, after roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed earlier this month to registered voters in the state's 7th congressional district to choose a candidate to finish the term of the late rep. elijah cummings. he died in october.\n\nafter thousands of wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible — in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic.\n\nthe election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. more than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in.\n\nmfume, a 71-year-old democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before cummings.\n\nbaltimore resident kyle baylor said he planned to drop off his ballot with a vote for mfume at the post office. baylor cited mfume's experience.\n\nhe has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what i've seen, he seems to care about the issues of baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need, baylor said.\n\ndemocrats outnumber republicans by more than 4-1 in the majority-black district, which includes a significant portion of baltimore, as well as parts of baltimore and howard counties.\n\nmfume supports stronger gun-control measures, such as reauthorizing a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2005. he also is focusing on the root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. he has made health care a priority, particularly lower prescription drug costs.\n\ni believe very much in improving and strengthening obamacare, mfume said in a recent interview.\n\nklacik, a baltimore county republican central committee member, generated buzz with appearances on fox news. her social media posts last year showing trash and blight in baltimore prompted a call for her to appear on the network's program fox & friends. president donald trump went on to describe the 7th congressional district in tweets last year as a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live, at a time when cummings was the powerful house oversight committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president at the time.\n\nklacik, 38, has campaigned on economic development. she wants to help struggling parts of baltimore through a federal program known as opportunity zones. supported by trump, the program focuses on increasing private investment in distressed communities with tax incentives for people who invest in real estate projects and operate businesses in designated low-income communities.\n\nto me, the only way you're going to lift people out of poverty is with employment, and i think that's what really made me want to run for the seat, because i could see the need for career opportunities, not just jobs but actual careers, klacik said in a recent interview.\n\nthe winner will serve the remainder of cummings' term into january. the winner also will run as an incumbent in the state's june 2 primary to be his or her party's nominee for a full term. for the upcoming primary, voters also will be strongly urged to vote by mail.
it all started years ago, during the push for then-president bill clinton's impeachment, when lindsey graham, then a house member, was presenting the case to senators, including arizona's sen. john mccain.\n\ncongressman graham, on the most solemn occasion, said, 'you know, where i come from, any man calling a woman at 2 a.m. is up to no good,' mccain said in march of 2017, explaining the history of their friendship on cnn. i knew right then that lindsey graham was a guy i wanted to spend time with.\n\nit was a friendship that would remain strong to the very end. mccain died on saturday at 81.\n\namerica and freedom have lost one of her greatest champions, graham tweeted saturday night. ….and i've lost one of my dearest friends and mentor.\n\ni will need some time to absorb this, but i want cindy —and the entire mccain family — to know they are in my prayers.\n\ni will need some time to absorb this, but i want cindy —and the entire mccain family — to know they are in my prayers. — lindsey graham (@lindseygrahamsc) august 26, 2018\n\nthe two men hit the campaign trail together in 2000, during mccain's first presidential bid for the gop nomination. that race didn't go mccain's way, but when south carolina voters promoted graham to congress' upper chamber in 2003, they collaborated on legislation that would have major impacts on foreign policy. their senate gang once included now-former sen. joe lieberman, an democrat-turned-independent, until his retirement announcement in 2012. they were, the three amigos. when lieberman left the senate, that trio became a duo.\n\nwhen mccain cast the deciding vote against legislation graham introduced to overhaul the affordable care act in september 2017, wrecking republican chances of obamacare repeal, some questioned whether their friendship would weather the storm. president trump tweeted mccain had, let his best friend l.g. down! it would be the first of many verbal attacks mr. trump would make over mccain's vote in the months ahead.\n\nbut graham made it clear their friendship was much deeper than politics or any single bill.\n\nmy friendship with @senjohnmccain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is. — lindsey graham (@lindseygrahamsc) september 22, 2017\n\nhe is one of my dearest friends in the world, and john mccain can do whatever damn he wants to, he's earned that right, graham said on cnn during a health care debate the same month.\n\nto any american who's got a problem with john mccain's vote, all i can tell you is john mccain was willing to die for this country, and he can vote any way he wants to, and it doesn't matter to me, the south carolina senator said.\n\nwhen mccain announced he had brain cancer in july 2017, the revelation rocked washington, d.c. — but it particularly touched graham. it was graham who, after being on the phone with mccain, broke the news to a meeting of fellow senators discussing health care.\n\nthis disease has never had a more worthy opponent, graham told reporters following the diagnosis.\n\nthe two appeared on cnn together before the cancer diagnosis in march, and described their camaraderie.\n\nhe is loyal to his friends, said an emotional graham, fighting tears. he loves his country. and if he has to stand up to his party for his country, so be it. he would die for his country. i love him to death.\n\nhere is a glimpse of their friendship, in photos:\n\nflorence, : republican presidential hopeful john mccain (l) leaves a leaflet on the door of a house where no one was home while campaigning door to door with rep. lindsey graham, (r-sc), (r),12 february, 2000, in florence, south carolina. mccain will spend the weekend campaigning through south carolina and atlanta, georgia on his tour bus the straight talk express.

washington — the federal health insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, reopened monday for a special enrollment period that will run through mid-may as part of efforts by president biden to ensure that americans in need of insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic have access to health care.\n\nhealth care is a right, not a privilege — and i will do everything in my power to ensure that all americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve, mr. biden said in a statement. that is especially critical in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has already taken the lives of more than 470,000 of our fellow americans and infected more than one out of every 12 additional americans, often with devastating consequences to their health.\n\nthe special enrollment period, which extends to may 15, allows americans in need of health insurance to sign up for coverage through healthcare.gov. mr. biden signed an executive order in late january allowing the department of health and human services to establish the special enrollment period for uninsured and underinsured americans to seek coverage through the federal marketplace in light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.\n\nwe will get through this crisis if we look out for one another and work together to expand coverage, lower costs and ensure that health care truly is aa right for all americans, the president said.\n\nmr. biden vowed during the 2020 presidential campaign to preserve and expand the affordable care act, which he helped shepherd through congress while serving as vice president. in addition to the special enrollment period, the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced friday it is launching an education campaign that begins today focusing on increasing awareness of the added time to sign up for coverage, as well as the assistance available to those who qualify to pay for premiums.\n\npresident biden was clear: we need to strengthen the affordable care act and give more americans access to health care, especially during this pandemic, which has further demonstrated the importance of having the right coverage, health and human services acting secretary norris cochran said in a statement.
on wednesday night in atlanta at the fifth democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former president obama made on friday cautioning against radical change. during an interview with stacey abrams, mr. obama said, this is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. they like seeing things improved, but the average american doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\n\nthe remarks were first reported by the new york times.\n\ncbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson says several of the candidates were asked about this over the weekend but did not bite.\n\nsenator cory booker says he wants to stop delineating left from right and said the nominee should have the full support of the party to defeat president trump. senator elizabeth warren, whose tagline is big, structural change, said she is so grateful for what obama did on healthcare and the consumer financial protection bureau. mayor pete buttigieg said he agreed with the premise of mr. obama's comments and said the role of activists is to lead the country forward but politicians must still balance competing constituencies.\n\nthe candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the roughly eight million voters who went for mr. obama in 2012 and mr. trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among african americans and latinos, a major problem for hillary clinton in 2016. democrats scored big wins in louisiana and kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. but in both cases, the democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as medicare for all.\n\nmr. obama was also a topic of discussion at the debate in july when candidates argued over whether or not obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. on friday, mr. obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with abrams.\n\ni don't take it as a criticism when people say hey, it's great, obama did what he did and now we want to do more. that's the point.\n\nis president obama right – do americans want more gradual change?\n\nin this special debate edition of trail markers, the cbs news political unit gives a rundown of what to watch for from the 10 presidential candidates who made it to the stage plus other political news of the day.\n\nfrom the candidates\n\njoe biden\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson while democrats are united in criticizing mr. trump for asking the ukrainian government to investigate the biden family, it's a much more personal topic for the former vice president.\n\nwith the house impeachment hearings in full force, biden has continued to defend himself and his son, hunter, from the trump administration's allegations of wrongdoing in ukraine. the keen interest the administration has taken in the bidens is now a main topic of the former vice president's trail speeches, where it is cited as proof that the president thinks biden would be his toughest general election opponent.\n\nat wednesday's debate, biden can be expected to try and turn mr. trump's accusations into an advantage. and the former vice president also says that russian president vladimir putin and north korean dictator kim jong un are worried about a potential biden presidency. north korean state media recently called biden a rabid dog, a phrase biden laughs at.\n\nby highlighting both mr. trump's request to ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries—whom he calls thugs—biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like kim and putin tick. will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other democrats?\n\ncory booker\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter jack turman at a nevada democrats first in the west event sunday night, new jersey senator cory booker said the presidential election is not about left or right. it is about right and wrong. at the last debate, booker kept his focus on mr. trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow democrats. and at a california democratic party convention in long beach this past weekend, booker reiterated that democrats need to concentrate on winning back the white house instead of infighting. i'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing i'm going to stop is us tearing each other down, booker told reporters. after months of struggling in the polls, will booker look to throw some punches at his democratic competitors? or will he continue to focus on mr. trump?\n\npete buttigieg\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter jack turman south bend mayor pete buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, elizabeth warren and bernie sanders, on health care in the last debate. in contrast to warren and sanders' embrace of medicare for all, which would eliminate most private insurance plans, buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.\n\nbuttigieg specifically asked warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the massachusetts senator has been loath to admit. your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this, buttigieg said at the last debate.\n\nahead of wednesday's debate, warren has released two more plans on health care: one indicating that her plan would not increase taxes on middle class families and the other detailing a health care bill that includes an expansive public option that she says she would work to pass before medicare for all. meanwhile, two polls in the last week, including a cbs news battleground tracker poll, showed buttigieg rising in iowa. and with less than 80 days until the iowa caucus, buttigieg's competitors may start redirecting their fire toward the millennial mayor. how will buttigieg fend off potential attacks now that polling shows him in the top tier of candidates?\n\n\n\ntulsi gabbard\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter jack turman hawaii representative tulsi gabbard, who memorably dinged california senator kamala harris at a debate earlier this year, went on the attack against elizabeth warren in the last debate. gabbard has redirected her focus to hillary clinton since then, a response to the former democratic nominee's insinuation that the dovish congresswoman is a favorite of the russians. gabbard's campaign lawyer released a letter to clinton, who recently indicated that she could still run for president, saying that she defamed gabbard and demanded a retraction. will gabbard try to criticize warren again and will she continue to go after clinton?\n\nkamala harris\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter tim perry heading into the debate, kamala harris has seen a sharp decline in her poll numbers and has had to make major layoffs and changes with her staff. when asked how she plans to prepare for such a crucial debate, harris jokingly said prayer, but added, i'm going to just be present.\n\nwhile pete buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, harris took her first jab at the south bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at african americans. though harris laughed at the report, she warned that the democratic nominee must have to have the ability to unify the party and the country, and added and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are. is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?\n\namy klobuchar\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson if the past is any indication, a solid debate performance by klobuchar could lead to more money and a bounce in the polls. the minnesota senator had her best fundraising spree ever after the last debate, quickly raising $1.1 million dollars.\n\nsince then, other candidates like harris and former housing secretary julian castro have changed their campaign strategies to free-up cash and refocus their efforts. klobuchar, meanwhile, recently boasted in new hampshire that while her campaign prides itself on being frugal, they were looking to add staffers and offices, at least in iowa. the big moments for klobuchar at the last debate were her strong but polite criticisms of some progressive policies, such as medicare for all and forgiving student loans. klobuchar argues that she can deliver better, more politically realistic policies, such as a public option for healthcare and free community college. what will be the key policy difference she highlights this time?\n\nbernie sanders\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter cara korte the big question in last month's debate for bernie sanders was how he would perform just a few weeks after his heart attack, a test he passed easily. since then, sanders has seen bumps in polling while warren has struggled.\n\nhow can he keep that momentum rolling in the debate? essentially, just by maintaining his status quo. his campaign argues that folks at home know bernie sanders. they know that his signature policy is medicare for all. they know that he's 78 years old.\n\nthe sanders campaign says their path to victory is all about turnout, particularly among those who have never voted before. young people, the working class, and people of color are the wind in sanders' sails.\n\nare those the voters watching on debate night? perhaps. but it's more likely sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. still, sanders needs those committed democrats watching every debate night closely. can he win them over with a winning debate performance? he hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?\n\ntom steyer\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak tom steyer's ad blitzes have kept him on the debate stage, but the billionaire climate activist will likely need earned media to rise above his middle-of-the-road polling numbers. the debate stage is an opportunity for him to tout his status as the earliest candidate to call for mr. trump's impeachment. but with campaign scandals in both iowa and south carolina since the last debate, steyer could himself be a target for any opponent looking to score easy points.\n\nelizabeth warren\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak over the past month, elizabeth warren has faced more criticism than at any point since the early days of her campaign. the drama began at the last debate when her opponents swung at her from all sides.\n\nsince then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for medicare for all and get congress to pass it. but that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. with the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original medicare for all bill, warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. but while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, buttigieg's recent polling surge in iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood. will her rivals continue to pile-on warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like biden and buttigieg?\n\n\n\nandrew yang\n\nvia cbs news political unit associate producer ben mitchell while andrew yang's poll numbers continue to hover somewhere between 2% and 4% in the early states, the campaign insists they're exactly where they want to be right now. yang is still bringing in plenty of donations, his campaign is hiring new people every week and voters are still getting to know him, campaign staffer argue, which leaves room for growth. they also point to other campaigns that are hemorrhaging support and money.\n\nbut in the latest cbs news battleground tracker, just 12% of all voters in the early primary and caucus states through super tuesday say they are considering yang. the campaign has done well to build support in online communities, but it is trying to spread the candidate's message to a wider audience. last week, the yang campaign launched a 7-figure ad buy in the early primary states with glossy ads focused on his health care policies and economic populism.\n\na strong debate performance, coupled with the massive buy, could provide a one-two punch for yang and help him connect with voters who really haven't paid much attention to him yet. he will likely stick to his vision of human-centered capitalism to help workers navigate the changing economy and talk about his plan for a new way forward in the 21st century, but voters could also hear more personal stories from yang. he's recently started branding himself as a parent and a patriot in his ads and on the\n\nstump. but will this message resonate enough with voters to give the candidate a needed boost?\n\nstate-by-state\n\niowa\n\nsince entering the race last spring, former joe biden has slipped eight points in iowa, according to the latest cbs news battleground tracker poll. biden continues to lead nationally and remains a top-tier candidate for his party's nomination, but in interviews during the first two weeks of november with a dozen top democratic leaders, officials and strategists, many expressed concerns to cbs news campaign reporters musadiq bidar and adam brewster about biden's standing in iowa.\n\ni wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs, said former democratic political operative grant woodard, who worked on hillary clinton's 2008 iowa campaign. a top iowa democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the intensity of support that other candidates have shown, adding, if he's not in the top three it's over.\n\nsome democratic leaders and officials cited other hurdles for biden, such as his struggles with fundraising compared to other top candidates, issues with his campaign's organizing ability, and lackluster performances from biden at campaign stops in iowa. while several democratic leaders and officials echoed that the campaign is in trouble, many acknowledged that biden has been able to hold on to his initial supporters.\n\nbiden repeatedly outpolls mr. trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like michigan and pennsylvania. and a clear majority of democratic voters say the ability to beat mr. trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. jesse harris, biden's senior iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get biden in front of as many iowans as possible. in an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, biden's team in iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and democrats, but also independents and republicans.\n\nelsewhere in iowa…\n\nsenator bernie sanders opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in iowa says bidar. the campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. this comes after congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez campaigned for sanders in iowa this month.\n\nover the weekend, the sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring ocasio-cortez. we're building the largest grassroots movement of working class iowans our state has ever seen, said sander's iowa field director michael fasullo in a statement. with these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in february.\n\nand senator kamala harris announced monday that she will be spending thanksgiving with her family in iowa. bidar notes that harris has spent four days in iowa this month and is scheduled to spend five days in the hawkeye state during the week of thanksgiving. according to the latest cbs news battleground tracker, harris is polling at 5% in iowa, tied for fifth place with amy klobuchar. harris's campaign says they have knocked on more than 200,000 doors in iowa since august. day by day and door by door, we are continuing to grow our network of supporters, volunteers, and precinct leaders that form the heart of our campaign, said iowa organizing director erin phillips.\n\ngovernor's mansion\n\ndemocrats win in louisiana\n\ndemocrat governor john bel edwards will be the first democrat governor to win reelection in louisiana since 1975, after defeating republican eddie rispone by just over one percent on saturday. and after almost two days of no public acknowledgement from mr. trump's twitter account, edwards spokesperson eric holl told cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro the president called to congratulate edwards in private. at his election night watch party, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice reports edwards only mentioned trump briefly in his remarks: you didn't just vote for me, you voted for four more years of putting louisiana first...and as for the president, god bless his heart.\n\nwhile mr. trump invested no small degree of political capital in the louisiana and kentucky only to watch republicans come up short, neither deep-red state is expected to be competitive in 2020's presidential race. still, national parties are looking for takeaways from saturday's result.\n\nthe democratic congressional campaign committee released a statement this weekend touting edwards' emphasis on expanding medicaid. governor john bel edwards earned a second term by working to make health care more affordable and accessible for the people he serves in louisiana...house republicans are likely reconsidering just how eager they are to rubber stamp president trump's reckless agenda in washington, said dccc chairwoman cheri bustos in a statement.
colorado sen. michael bennet is the latest democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on cbs this morning on thursday that he's running for president.\n\nmy plan is to run for president, bennet told cbs this morning co-anchor john dickerson. i think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.\n\nbennet, 54, overcame a bout with prostate cancer earlier this year. he was diagnosed in april and quickly underwent surgery, which his office said was completely successful and would require no further treatment. he told cbs his diagnosis was very clarifying, saying he was disappointed at the possibility of never being able to run.\n\nthat gave me a chance to think about whether i really wanted to run or not, he said.\n\nwhile he faces an uphill fundraising battle with his delayed entry into the already jam-packed field, bennet is optimistic about his political future.\n\ni wouldn't do it if i didn't think i had a chance to win, bennet, the 22nd democrat to enter the race, told the colorado independent shortly after his diagnosis. i think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. but i think everyone in the field is a long shot.\n\nasked about the packed field of challengers he now faces, bennet told cbs that it's phenomenal we have an array of candidates that we have calling it a competition of ideas.\n\nthe democratic party doesn't stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the american people think, argued bennet. a process like this is long overdue in the democratic party.\n\nin a nearly 4-minute long campaign video released thursday morning titled 7,591 words (a nod to the word count of the u.s. constitution) bennet makes the case that politics and governing aren't the same thing.\n\nwhen campaigning never stops, governing never begins, he adds.\n\nbennet acknlowedged in his campaign appeal that while he may lack in national name recognition because i don't go on cable news everyday, he came to washington because he wants to pay attention to what would help the people who sent me there make their lives better.\n\nso you may not know me, but over the years i've learned a lot about what americans struggle with.\n\nthe senator refers to himself as a pragmatic idealist, looking to herald in a new era of progress for washington. he told dickerson that he has a tendency to tell the truth to his constituents in colorado and now wants the chance to do that with the american people.\n\nconsidered a relatively moderate democrat, bennet has represented colorado in the u.s. senate since 2009. before entering politics, he spent seven years in the private sector where served as director of the anschutz investment company. it was there that he managed the consolidation of three major movie chains into the regal entertainment group.\n\nin 2003, bennet became the chief of staff to then-denver mayor john hickenlooper, who is also running for the democratic presidential nomination. he left hickenlooper's office in 2005 to become superintendent of the denver public school system, where he helped pass a merit pay system for teachers. he was later appointed to fill the senate seat vacated by ken salazar in 2009 and promptly re-elected the following year.\n\nin a departure from his fellow democratic contenders, bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like medicare-for-all.\n\ni don't think 180 million americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union, said bennet.\n\nbennet was born in new dehli while his father served as an aide to the u.s. ambassador to india. his father then went on to take posts in the carter and clinton administrations, while his grandfather was an adviser to franklin roosevelt.
control of the senate hinges in part on a race in missouri. democratic sen. claire mccaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, josh hawley. missouri voted for president trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. cbs news contributor and host of npr's morning edition, steve inskeep, took a road trip down historic route 66 for three meals with missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.\n\nbreakfast: cuba, missouri\n\nthe trip started before dawn at shelly's route 66 café in the small town of cuba, missouri – where friends gather, and strangers are made to feel welcome, their slogan goes.\n\nbreakfast at shelly's route 66 café in the small town of cuba, missouri cbs news\n\nthere we found a group of small business owners, veterans, and retirees who all support the president. however, sue greenstreet is feeling dread. she's on medicare.\n\nif they put everyone on medicare, we seniors will be next in the line for bullet in the head… because they can't afford medicare for everyone… it would not work, greenstreet said.\n\nacross the table, diane nickel fears social unrest.\n\nthere's riots and people have become so divided. instead of being american citizens, they decided to either be one side or the other. i think that that is just horrible, nickel said.\n\ncuba is decorated with murals showing famous moments in the town's history, like an 1864 battle during the civil war. it's a town that knows something about a divided country.\n\nlunch: ferguson, missouri\n\n\n\nferguson, missouri, a red area of the map, is where michael brown was killed by a police officer in 2014. cathy and jerome jenkins kept their restaurant open during the protests that followed.\n\ntoday, their street has recovered and the jenkins would like to see more black-owned businesses.\n\nmy concerns about the community would be equal opportunities, jerome said.\n\n\n\nlunch at cathy's kitchen in ferguson, missouri cbs news\n\nif you've ever just went in to open something', there's so many papers, there's so many things you've got to do. there's so many taxes you have to file every month. it's like the system is made to be difficult, cathy said, sounding a bit more like a republican than a democrat. i don't want anyone ever to think that i think a republican can't help me….it does sound like we have a few things in common, right?\n\njust not their view of obamacare, which cut the jenkins' insurance costs. they want to elect a democratic congress to stop the president's attacks on it.\n\nhe's doing things that i cannot even explain, so it's almost hard for me to speak because i can't believe that anybody else doesn't see it! jerome said.\n\ndinner: st. louis, missouri\n\nat st. louis's schlafly tap room, inskeep met flight attendant jana wayne, who didn't vote in 2016, and bartender shea bandera, who voted for donald trump. both say he's done a better job than they expected. but for bandera, there's one thing he doesn't agree with the president on: climate change.\n\nit's already affecting us right now. i mean, we're having record floods, we're having record hurricanes, bandera said.\n\ndinner at schlafly tap room in st. louis, missouri cbs news\n\nover at the bar at schlafly's, inskeep met a progressive couple who favors democrats, but they know much of their conservative state will not.\n\nthe president is encouraging lack of empathy. like, lack of empathy, lack of respect, karen clodfelter said.\n\nthis isn't a zero sum world that we live in, her, partner john shepherd, said of what he hopes republicans will understand. and it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. if i have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. not just mine – everyone's.\n\nwe'll find out soon which party gets their voters to show up in missouri. president trump will be holding rallies in the state twice before election day.
senate republicans unveiled a discussion draft of the bill thursday of their plan to repeal and replace obamacare that would end the health care law's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, cut back an expansion of medicaid, but would keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the house-passed bill.\n\nhere's the full text of the discussion draft of the bill.\n\nthe 142-page measure would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower income recipients to help them buy insurance. this differs from the house bill, which tied its tax credits to age. obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. the senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free health savings accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for planned parenthood.\n\nmedicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. the senate bill would also slash funding to medicaid from what republicans call gimmicks that drive up federal costs. president trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut medicaid, medicare or social security.\n\nsenate majority mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, aims to hold a vote on the legislation before lawmakers leave at the end of next week for the week-long july 4 recess.\n\nobamacare isn't working. by nearly any measure, it has failed, and no amount of 11th-hour, reality-denying or buck-passing by democrats is going to change the fact that more americans are going to get hurt unless we do something, he said on the floor after the bill was posted. republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer, d-new york, noted that the president had asked for a bill with more heart than the house bill, but this bill, schumer said, is every bit as bad as the house version and maybe meaner. the way this bill cuts health care is heartless, he said on the floor.\n\nthis bill will result in higher costs, less care and millions of americans will lose their health insurance, particularly through medicaid, schumer added.\n\nrepublicans need a simple majority to pass it, rather than a supermajority since they're using the budget reconciliation process. they may still have to rely on vice president mike pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. the senate currently has 52 republicans and 48 democrats. that means if all democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from republicans can torpedo it. even if republicans are successful in getting it through the upper chamber, they would then still need to reconcile it with version passed by the house in early may, reach a bicameral agreement with house republicans, and hold votes in the house and senate on that version again.\n\na cost estimate of the bill from the nonpartisan congressional budget office (cbo) is expected to be released by early next week. white house staff met with senate republican staffers wednesday night on capitol hill to review the bill.\n\non thursday morning, the senate republican conference sat through a closed-door briefing for an hour and a half to learn about the bill's substance. many inside the meeting didn't actually see the text even though it was posted online.\n\nyou've seen the text? moderate sen. lisa murkowski, r-alaska, asked a reporter. well, you've seen it before we've seen it.\n\nsen. john mccain, r-arizona, called it a good proposal overall, but that there's a lot to absorb.\n\nsenators who emerged from the meeting didn't appear entirely confident it would pass next week.\n\ni think we have a long way to go before we know the answer to that question, sen. tim scott, r-south carolina, said when asked if it could pass next week, adding that the draft version could be modified before a vote happens. i'm open to moving forward on the legislation. we have a lot of time now -- seven days -- to figure out what parts we like about it, what parts we plan to keep. this is only a draft legislation. we're going to make a lot of changes over the next seven days.\n\nseveral senators are already expressing concerns about the proposal.\n\nat first glance, i have serious concerns about the bill's impact on the nevadans who depend on medicaid. i will read it, share it with governor sandoval, and continue to listen to nevadans to determine the bill's impact on our state, said sen. dean heller, r-nevada, in a statement. heller is up for re-election next year and is considered by democrats to be one of the most vulnerable republicans.\n\nsen. rand paul, r-kentucky, didn't appear to be a fan of the bill.\n\nconservatives have always been for repealing obamacare, and my concern is that this doesn't repeal obamacare, paul told reporters. what i've seen so far is that it keeps 10 out of 12 regulations, it continues the obamacare subsidies, and i think ultimately will not bring down premiums, because instead of trying to fix the death spiral of obamacare, it simply subsidizes it with taxpayer money to insurance companies. so for those reasons, it looks a lot like obamacare instead of a repeal of obamacare.\n\nsen. bill cassidy, r-louisiana, said he's happy that the bill makes an effort to lower premiums immediately, but he said he wants to ensure that as medicaid is scaled back, we don't lose the the ability for lower-income folks to be able to afford insurance.\n\nsen. lindsey graham, r-south carolina, said in a statement that he needs to carefully review the text first, but would prefer to address health care reform in a bipartisan manner, accusing democrats of being unwilling to negotiate with republicans.\n\nthe house bill, which narrowly passed in a 217-213 vote on may 4, would significantly reduce the funding for obamacare subsidies, revamp tax credits so that they're tied to a person's age, freeze the medicaid expansion in 2020 and allow states to seek waivers from a rule that requires states to offer essential benefits in their plans and a provision that prevents insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more money compared to healthy people. instead of obamacare's insurance mandate, the house republican bill would incentivize people to have continuous coverage. should coverage be interrupted for more than 63 days, insurers would be able to charge a 30 percent penalty over the original premium for one year.\n\nthe cbo didn't release its cost estimate on the house bill until may 24, which projected that 23 million more people would be without health insurance over the next decade under the bill.\n\nthe senate's version was supposedly crafted by a working group consisting of 13 republican men -- and no women -- but one of the group's participants, sen. mike lee, r-utah, said even he had been left in the dark. lee said the measure was apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the republican leadership in the senate.\n\nother senate republicans voiced frustration that the process had been too secretive and out of the public eye. senate republicans don't intend to hold any committee hearings on the bill, despite their commitment to so-called regular order.\n\nnearly three-quarters of americans said senate republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a cbs news poll released tuesday. a quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. it also found 57 percent said obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place.\n\ncbs news' nancy cordes and alan he contributed to this report.
president trump delivered his second state of the union address tuesday, feb. 5, 2019, from the house chamber. the white house released the president's remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nmadam speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states, and my fellow americans:\n\nwe meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. as we begin a new congress, i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans.\n\nmillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.\n\nthe agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda. it is the agenda of the american people.\n\nmany of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america's interests first.\n\nthere is a new opportunity in american politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. victory is not winning for our party. victory is winning for our country.\n\nthis year, america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america's mission, and the power of american pride.\n\nin june, we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d. eisenhower called the great crusade — the allied liberation of europe in world war ii. on d-day, june 6, 1944, 15,000 young american men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. here with us tonight are three of those heroes: private first class joseph reilly, staff sergeant irving locker, and sergeant herman zeitchik. gentlemen, we salute you.\n\npresident trump recognized world war ii veterans in the audience at the state of the union address, feb. 5, 2019. cbs news\n\nin 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon. half a century later, we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: buzz aldrin. this year, american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets.\n\nin the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.\n\nwe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\n\nbut we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\n\ntogether, we can break decades of political stalemate. we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future. the decision is ours to make.\n\nwe must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\n\ntonight, i ask you to choose greatness.\n\nover the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.\n\nin just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.\n\nwages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who i promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps. the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. african-american, hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. more people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.\n\nwe passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.\n\nwe virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.\n\nwe eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.\n\nmy administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.\n\nwe have unleashed a revolution in american energy — the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. and now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\n\nafter 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day. members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.\n\non friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. an economic miracle is taking place in the united states — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.\n\nif there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. it just doesn't work that way!\n\nwe must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.\n\nthis new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.\n\nnow is the time for bipartisan action. believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.\n\nin the last congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic va reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\n\nand just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. last year, i heard through friends the story of alice johnson. i was deeply moved. in 1997, alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. she had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.\n\nalice johnson wipes away a tear as president trump talks about commuting her sentence for a nonviolent drug offense during his state of the union address, feb. 5, 2019. cbs news\n\nalice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. she served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.\n\nin june, i commuted alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.\n\nwhen i saw alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, i knew i did the right thing.\n\ninspired by stories like alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law. this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african-american community. the first step act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. now, states across the country are following our lead. america is a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nwe are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee. in 1996, at age 30, matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. now, matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act. matthew, on behalf of all americans: welcome home.\n\nas we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.\n\nthe congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.\n\nnow is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\n\nas we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the united states. we have just heard that mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. i have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.\n\nthis is a moral issue. the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all americans. we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. i want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.\n\ntonight, i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.\n\nno issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\n\nmeanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.\n\ntolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.\n\nhuman traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\n\ntens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.\n\nthe savage gang, ms-13, now operates in 20 different american states, and they almost all come through our southern border. just yesterday, an ms-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city. we are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.\n\nyear after year, countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.\n\ni've gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.\n\nhere tonight is debra bissell. just three weeks ago, debra's parents, gerald and sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their reno, nevada, home by an illegal alien. they were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. also here tonight are gerald and sharon's granddaughter, heather, and great‑granddaughter, madison.\n\nto debra, heather, madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. but i will never forget, and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon, that it should never happen again.\n\nnot one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\n\nin the last 2 years, our brave ice officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.\n\nwe are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ice special agent elvin hernandez. when elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic. at the age of eight, elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. elvin says: if i can make sure these young girls get their justice, i've done my job. thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.\n\nspecial agent hernandez, please stand: we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement — and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice.\n\nmy administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.\n\nit includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. in the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. i'll get it built.\n\nthis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.\n\nsan diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.\n\nthe border city of el paso, texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. now, with a powerful barrier in place, el paso is one of our safest cities.\n\nsimply put, walls work and walls save lives. so let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make america safe.\n\nas we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.\n\nno one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before.\n\nas part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\n\nto build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.\n\nwe are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end.\n\ntherefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods — and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us — i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs.\n\nanother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta.\n\ni have met the men and women of michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, indiana, new hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta. for years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. but no one ever tried — until now.\n\nour new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement — or usmca — will replace nafta and deliver for american workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding american agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the usa.\n\ntonight, i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.\n\nboth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure.\n\ni know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. this is not an option. this is a necessity.\n\nthe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nalready, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\n\nbut we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.\n\ni am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients. we should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.\n\nno force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom. in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids. scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years. together, we will defeat aids in america.\n\ntonight, i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.\n\njoining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, grace eline. every birthday since she was 4, grace asked her friends to donate to st. jude children's research hospital. she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. last year, grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. immediately, she began radiation treatment. at the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. when grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: last day of chemo. grace — you are an inspiration to us all.\n\nmany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. my budget will ask the congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.\n\nto help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for america's children. i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\n\nthere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.\n\nto defend the dignity of every person, i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.\n\nlet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of god.\n\nthe final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security.\n\nover the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. for years, the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies.\n\nas part of our military build-up, the united states is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.\n\nunder my administration, we will never apologize for advancing america's interests.\n\nfor example, decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. while we followed the agreement to the letter, russia repeatedly violated its terms. that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, or inf treaty.\n\nperhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding china and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.\n\nas part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam.\n\ntwo weeks ago, the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela, and its new interim president, juan guaido.\n\nwe stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair.\n\nhere, in the united states, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. america was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.\n\none of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east.\n\nour approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel — and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem.\n\nour brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years. in afghanistan and iraq, nearly 7,000 american heroes have given their lives. more than 52,000 americans have been badly wounded. we have spent more than $7 trillion in the middle east.\n\nas a candidate for president, i pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nwhen i took office, isis controlled more than 20,000 square miles in iraq and syria. today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.\n\nnow, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis, it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home.\n\ni have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan. our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.\n\nin afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups, including the taliban. as we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.\n\nabove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the uss cole — and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.\n\nwe are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley, whose son, navy seaman craig wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole.\n\nmy administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran.\n\nto ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal. and last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\n\nwe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.\n\njust months ago, 11 jewish-americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. officer matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.\n\ntonight, we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet. he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps. today is judah's 81st birthday. judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. suddenly the train screeched to a halt. a soldier appeared. judah's family braced for the worst. then, his father cried out with joy: it's the americans.\n\na second holocaust survivor who is here tonight, joshua kaufman, was a prisoner at dachau concentration camp. he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks. to me, joshua recalls, the american soldiers were proof that god exists, and they came down from the sky.\n\ni began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchik. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.\n\nwhen american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.\n\nthey did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.\n\nwhy did they do it? they did it for america — they did it for us.\n\neverything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before.\n\nthink of this capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.\n\nhere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.\n\nwhat will we do with this moment? how will we be remembered?\n\ni ask the men and women of this congress: look at the opportunities before us! our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. our most exciting journeys still await. our biggest victories are still to come. we have not yet begun to dream.\n\nwe must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.\n\nwe must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans. we do the incredible. we defy the impossible. we conquer the unknown.\n\nthis is the time to re-ignite the american imagination. this is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.\n\nthis is our future — our fate — and our choice to make. i am asking you to choose greatness.\n\nno matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\n\nwe must keep america first in our hearts. we must keep freedom alive in our souls. and we must always keep faith in america's destiny — that one nation, under god, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!\n\nthank you. god bless you, god bless america, and good night!

washington — the senate judiciary committee is set to convene monday for the first day of confirmation hearings for judge amy coney barrett, president trump's nominee to the supreme court, in what is expected to be a fiercely partisan battle over the future of the high court.\n\nexpected to last four days, monday's hearing will feature opening statements from the panel's 22 members, as well as introductions of barrett by indiana senators todd young and mike braun, and patricia o'hara, the former dean of notre dame law school.\n\nmr. trump nominated barrett, a judge on the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals, to succeed the late justice ruth bader ginsburg on the supreme court last month. if barrett, 48, is confirmed, she will be mr. trump's third appointment, and her addition to the nation's highest court will expand its conservative majority to 6-3.\n\nthe republican-controlled senate is charging ahead with barrett's confirmation at a pace that is uncharacteristic of the upper chamber, as they and mr. trump want her confirmed before the general election on november 3. but democrats are casting barrett's nomination as illegitimate, citing the proximity to election day.\n\nin addition to the short timeline, the recent covid-19 diagnoses from three republican senators, two of whom serve on the judiciary committee, has further roiled the confirmation process. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell canceled legislative activity until october 19 after senators mike lee, thom tillis and ron johnson tested positive for the coronavirus, but this week's hearings are proceeding as planned, with members having the opportunity to participate remotely.\n\nstill, republicans hope to hold a final vote to confirm barrett in the last week of october.\n\nhere is what to expect for barrett's confirmation hearings:\n\nthe senators to watch\n\nthere are 22 members on the judiciary committee — 12 republicans and 10 democrats — and each will have their chance to question barrett directly later in the week.\n\nsome members of the committee are in tough reelection fights: chairman lindsey graham of south carolina, and republicans joni ernst of iowa and tillis of north carolina.\n\neyes will also be on senator kamala harris of california, the democratic vice presidential nominee. a former prosecutor, harris garnered attention for her questioning of justice brett kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings in 2018.\n\nshe is expected to participate in the hearings remotely from her senate office, her office said, citing judiciary committee republicans' refusal to take commonsense steps to protect members, aides, capitol complex workers and members of the media.\n\ncovid-19 and the confirmation process\n\nmr. trump nominated barrett to the supreme court in a ceremony in the white house rose garden where there was limited social distancing and few wore masks. dr. anthony fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, described the ceremony to cbs news as a super-spreader event because so many of the attendees, including the president and first lady melania trump, soon tested positive for covid-19.\n\nlee, of utah, and tillis both tested positive for the virus after attending the white house event, and it's unclear whether they will participate in the hearings in person or remotely.\n\ngraham, who leads the committee, publicly refused to take a covid-19 test when challenged by his democratic opponent last week to do so.\n\nthe hearings will be a venue for democrats to air their criticisms of republicans' response to the pandemic, as well as to gauge how the senators — and barrett — react to the public safety threat. barrett contracted the virus and recovered from it over the summer, according to the washington post. the white house said on october 2 she tested negative after the september 26 event.\n\nwhat to expect from democrats\n\nalthough barrett is expected to garner support from most, if not all, 53 republican senators, most democrats will likely oppose her confirmation. barrett has only been on the federal bench for three years, but she has conservative bona fides and credits the late justice antonin scalia with shaping her judicial philosophy.\n\ndemocrats, meanwhile, are concerned that she would rule to kill the affordable care act, chip away at abortion rights and expand the scope of the second amendment.\n\nsenator dianne feinstein of california, the ranking member of the committee, has been criticized for questioning barrett's catholic faith during the 2017 confirmation hearings for barrett's nomination to the federal appeals court on which she currently serves. if feinstein or any other democrats ask questions about how barrett's faith influences her decision-making on critical issues like abortion, republicans may take the opportunity to paint them as being anti-catholic.\n\ndemocrats are also fuming that the confirmation process is happening so close to election day, four years after republicans blocked the confirmation of judge merrick garland to the supreme court because it was an election year. democrats are expected to question barrett about her judicial record, but they also may use their time to excoriate their republican colleagues for choosing to hold the hearings now.\n\nwhile democrats have few procedural tools at their disposal to block barrett's nomination, senate minority leader chuck schumer on sunday vowed to deny republicans the quorum needed for a vote by the judiciary committee and on the senate floor.\n\ndemocrats are also mounting a fight over materials they claim are missing from her questionnaire submitted to the committee.\n\nthe issues will barrett will be questioned on\n\nsenate democrats have made the future of obamacare a focal point of their opposition to barrett's nomination, especially since the supreme court is set to hear a challenge to the obama-era healthcare law november 10, just seven day after the election.\n\nto bolster their case against barrett, democrats cite an essay she wrote in 2017, in which barrett was critical of chief justice john roberts' majority opinion in the blockbuster 2012 supreme court case upholding obamacare's individual mandate.\n\nbarrett wrote roberts pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. his decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that chief justice roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.\n\nbut the dispute before the justices this term raises different issues than the 2012 legal challenge to obamacare, making it more difficult to discern how barrett may rule.\n\nso far, at least one democrat on the committee, senator chris coons of delaware, has committed to asking barrett about obamacare.\n\nin addition to the affordable care act, barrett will likely be pressed about roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nin the two abortion cases she was involved in during her tenure on the 7th circuit, she joined the dissent in ruling to deny requests for the the full appeals court to rehear disputes.\n\nin 2018, when the 7th circuit weighed whether the full court should rehear a case involving a challenge to an indiana abortion law that requires fetal remains to be cremated or buried after an abortion, barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc authored by judge frank easterbrook. in his dissent, easterbrook took issue with a panel decision striking down a different statute that prohibits abortion based on sex, race or disability.\n\nthen, in 2019, barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing of a challenge to an indiana law that would have required doctors to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion. a three-judge panel found the law was unconstitutional.\n\nbarrett has written that abortion is always amoral, and in 2006, she signed on to an anti-abortion newspaper advertisement that opposed abortion on demand. in 2013, barrett's name also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the group university faculty for life, which said we affirm our full support for our university's commitment to the right to life.\n\nbut as a nominee to the 7th circuit, barrett told the judiciary committee she would follow all supreme court precedent without fail and during a speech at notre dame in 2013 said it's very unlikely the high court would overturn roe, according to the student newspaper the observer.\n\nto get a broader understanding of barrett's views on abortion, democrats will likely ask whether she believes roe and planned parenthood v. casey, a major abortion case from 1992, were rightly decided, as well as for her views on stare decisis, the legal principle that says courts must follow precedent.\n\nbut it's unlikely barrett will divulge her views on abortion or those cases, as nominees typically avoid weighing in on issues that may come before them as a jurist.\n\nthe election\n\ngarland's failed confirmation in 2016 is providing the backdrop for barrett's nomination fight. while democrats say voters should have a voice in choosing the president who fills ginsburg's seat, republicans argue this vacancy is different from the fight in 2016, as the same party controls the senate and the white house.\n\nbut also casting a shadow over barrett's confirmation hearing are possible legal showdowns stemming from the november election, as mr. trump has predicted the outcome of the presidential race could be decided by the supreme court.\n\nthat prospect has been the backbone of the president's insistence on the senate confirming barrett before election day.\n\nsenate democrats will likely push barrett to commit to recusing herself from any election-related disputes that come before the high court. but it's unlikely she will do so, as each individual justice decides whether to sit out a case.
phoenix — in his second day on the campaign trail, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg stood in strong contrast to many of his democratic rivals in the presidential race. he criticized not only their campaign strategies but their policies.\n\nhe spent tuesday in arizona — a state president trump won in 2016 — where he said you don't often see presidential candidates.\n\nthe fact is, president trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country, bloomberg told reporters. that's a big problem for our party, and i am determined to change exactly that.\n\nhe sees a chance for democrats to flip the state if they make it a priority, just as he is.\n\nthe move to start in arizona comes as bloomberg is taking the path less traveled in the presidential race. he will not appear on the ballot in some early-voting states, such as new hampshire, and he has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like iowa.\n\narizona has also been a focus of priorities usa, a democratic super pac seeking to mobilize latinos in arizona and florida.\n\nbloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to medicare for all and a wealth tax.\n\nfellow billionaire tom steyer has urged bloomberg to support a wealth tax, but bloomberg said other countries have failed to show it can be successful.\n\non health care, bloomberg called medicare for all — which is supported in some form by most of the democratic candidates — a solution to the problem. he said it's better to tweak obamacare and restore some of the cuts that were taken away. former vice president joe biden has a similar stance.\n\nmedicare for all would destroy our hospital system. doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans, he said. people want to keep their private plans.
washington -- protecting his signature domestic achievement, president barack obama on friday vetoed legislation to repeal his health care law, saying the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.\n\nrepublican lawmakers have pushed many repeal measures since 2010, when obama signed the health care program into law. this was the first of those bills to clear congress and reach his desk.\n\nrepublicans have argued that the law doesn't work and promised to override the veto next year.\n\nit's no surprise that someone named obama vetoed a bill repealing obamacare, house speaker paul ryan, r-wisconsin, said in a video released friday. this law will collapse under its own weight or it will be repealed...next year, if we're sending this bill to a republican president, it will get signed into law. obamacare will be gone.\n\nin his veto message to congress, obama disagreed. obama said the affordable care act includes fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that have made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable and more patient-centered. and it is working.\n\nthe veto was expected. but republicans claimed victory with the vote, arguing that they met two goals by finally passing a repeal bill: keeping a promise to voters in an election year, and showing that they are capable of repealing the law if a republican wins november's presidential election.\n\nthe bill would have ended the law's medicaid expansion and subsidies and would eliminate the tax increases imposed under the law. the legislation would also cut federal funding for planned parenthood.\n\nthe senate passed the measure last year under special rules that protected it from a democratic filibuster, and the house passed it this week.
vice president mike pence on friday delivered remarks at an event for rick saccone, the gop nominee running in the special election to fill the seat vacated by former rep. tim murphy, r-pennsylvania, which is being held on march 13. conor lamb is the democratic candidate running for the seat.\n\npence urged pennsylvania voters to turn out at the polls next month. he argued that with saccone in office, congress would end budget cuts to the nation's armed forces and would pass funding to build a border wall.\n\nthe vice president attacked the democratic challenger for not revealing his positions on issues such as obamacare.
supreme court to hear legal challenge to affordable care act the u.s. supreme court will take up a legal challenge to the affordable care act. at issue in the case is the constitutionality of the law's individual mandate. the justices will hear the case in october, meaning it is likely to become a major issue during the presidential campaign. cbs news chief legal correspondent jan crawford joins cbsn with more.
donald trump's longtime adviser roger stone said monday that the gop presidential nominee should release his tax returns.\n\nin an interview on 610 wiod miami radio's fernand amandi show, stone was asked if trump is making a mistake by not releasing his returns.\n\nyes, i think he should release his tax returns immediately, stone said in the interview, first reported by buzzfeed.\n\nhis comment came after trump's new campaign manager, kellyanne conway, reversed her position that trump should release his tax returns.\n\nin april, conway told cnn that she'd like see trump's returns become transparent, but in multiple interviews on sunday, she said he shouldn't while they remain under audit.\n\nso now that i'm on the inside, i know something i didn't know then. he's under audit. he's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on cnn's state of the union.\n\ntrump made it clear several months before conway's interview with cnn in april that his returns are under audit and that he wouldn't release them until it is completed.\n\nthe audit on trump's returns, however, from 2002 to 2008 is complete, and conway was asked about releasing those returns.\n\nthis entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: i don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told cnn.
republican-led legislatures in wisconsin and michigan in lame duck sessions are aiming to limit the powers of incoming democratic governors in their states, prompting sore loser allegations from opponents who say lawmakers are undermining voters. but the moves also raise broader questions about whether such efforts have become the new normal in a political environment in which state bodies are becoming more partisan--and more powerful.\n\na month after longtime wisconsin gov. scott walker lost his re-election bid to democrat tony evers, republican lawmakers moved forward with legislation to curb his successor's power over a key economic development agency and over state litigation, including a lawsuit over obamacare. the measure, which will be voted on tuesday, would also limit early voting to two weeks. another proposal to move the date of the 2020 presidential primary, so as not to coincide with the re-election of a conservative state supreme court justice, did not advance out of committee.\n\nand in michigan, where democrat gretchen whitmer defeated incumbent gov. rick snyder, republicans put forth proposals to give the legislature authority in legal fights and to create a commission to oversee the state's campaign finance laws, according to the detroit news. the moves come nearly two years after the republican legislature in north carolina made similar efforts, some of which are being challenged in court, to lessen the power of democrat roy cooper, after he narrowly defeated gop incumbent gov. pat mccrory.\n\nhow do you stop the descending spiral? says wisconsin democratic strategist joe zepecki. every two years this just gets worse and worse...what you're seeing is more behavior in state legislatures and at the state level that is similar to what we're seeing in congress.\n\nas congress becomes increasingly mired in gridlock, states have become increasingly empowered and motivated to act on issues of national importance. and more state legislatures have fallen under one-party control; after the 2018 midterm elections, only one state -- minnesota -- has a divided legislature. democrats control 19 legislatures while republicans control 30. and after democrats made gains in governorships via november's elections, 13 states have one party controlling the executive and the other in charge of the legislature.\n\nin wisconsin, republicans have had full control of the state for the past eight years. and in michigan, republicans have had full control since 2011. democrats in those states, both of which are also critical to the 2020 presidential contest, argue that republicans are dismissing the will of voters during lame duck sessions.\n\nthere's nothing that says a state legislature can't come in and pass legislation, says zepecki. it's a long standing norm in this country to respect the will of elections and move on to the next legislative session.\n\nin a statement, evers called the moves unfettered attempts to override and ignore what the people of wisconsin asked for this november...this is rancor and politics as usual.\n\nrepublicans insist that the measures are a way to balance government, and point to legislative moves in 2010 to extend union contracts during the lame duck before walker took office, though that measure did not limit the power of the governor. for all the talk about reigning in power, it really doesn't, walker told reporters monday, according to the milwaukee journal sentinel.\n\nbut gop senate majority leader scott fitzgerald acknowledged the political underpinnings at play. we trusted scott walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the legislature. we don't trust tony evers right now in a lot of these areas, he told a conservative radio host.\n\nrepublicans want to make sure they are not going to appear to be lap dogs and lay down. they are saying yes, evers won, but it's not a mandate and he can't arbitrarily throw out everything they've worked on for eight years. that becomes laying down the political gauntlet, says republican strategist brandon scholz, asked about the politics at play. if roles were reversed, and democrats were fortifying things they'd worked on for eight years, republicans would say the same thing.\n\nthere's very little decorum left, scholz says. everything is going to be a political fight.
