depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.\n\nthen there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.\n\nhave no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's reevaluating their lifestyle.\n\non wednesday, u.s. news and world report released its annual rankings of the best diets for 2019, revealing the mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.\n\nmore:mediterranean is the best way to eat in 2019, according to new diet rankings\n\nmore:need a new diet this new year? here's how to pick one and stick with it\n\nmore:how to get fit and stay in shape in the new year\n\neach diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on u.s. news and world report rankings. we've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. while doing this study they took into account the diet being relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease.\n\nhere are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity instagram captions in 2019.\n\nketogenic\n\nperhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the ketogenic, or keto, diet. celebs like kourtney kardashian, al roker and vinny guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname keto guido on the new seasons of jersey shore) have popularized the diet. ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. so, instead, it burns fat. the keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. u.s. news & world report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.1/5 weight loss | 1.5/5 healthy\n\npaleo\n\nthe philosophy of this diet is in the name. the paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our paleolithic ancestors. in case you need to brush up on your high school science, the paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. and, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the paleolithic era, paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. those who follow the paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to stone age-approved meals.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.5/5 weight loss | 2.7/5 healthy\n\nalkaline diet\n\nacid is the enemy of the alkaline diet. the thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. you may be thinking: what else is there to eat? the alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. these are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a ph value of 7, which is neutral, or above. foods with a ph value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. that said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the ph values of your food will change the overall ph balance of your body. it will do that naturally. however, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.1/5 weight loss | 3.0/5 healthy\n\nwhole30\n\na popular diet that spurred a new york times bestselling book, whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. a head of broccoli? go for it. a piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? not so much. the program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life. this program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.4/5 on weight loss | 2.4/5 on healthy\n\nmediterranean\n\nthe mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the mediterranean. the diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on bad cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. for example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. in essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.0/5 on weight loss | 4.9/5 on healthy\n\nflexitarian\n\nthink of the flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. the term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. new york times columnist mark bittman (who also wrote vb6: eat vegan before 6:00) has a big role in popularizing this diet. bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. an easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says dawn jackson blatner, the author of the flexitarian diet and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.4/5 on weight loss | 4.7/5 on healthy\n\nlectin-free\n\nwe can trace the popularity of this diet back to kelly clarkson's praise of the plant paradox cookbook by dr. steve gundry. she said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. an extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. an extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. it's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.\n\nu.s. news & world report: no ranking available
thomas maresca\n\nspecial to usa today\n\nseoul — when north and south korea meet tuesday for the first time in two years, both sides hope the talks will lead to improved relations beyond next month's winter olympics near here.\n\nat the same time, u.s. and south korean leaders vowed that the dialogue won't weaken their hard stance against the north's burgeoning nuclear and missile programs.\n\nthe will to enhance north-south relations must be backed up not by words, but by practical actions to foster inter-korean reconciliation and unity, and reunification, the north's official korean central news agency (kcna) said in an editorial sunday.\n\n\n\nthe two koreas will meet in the border village of panmunjom, located in the demilitarized zone that has divided the korean peninsula since a war ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty.\n\nnorth korea alerted the south over the weekend that it will send its veteran negotiator on inter-korean relations, ri son gwon, to lead its five-person delegation to the meeting. ri has represented pyongyang for cross-border military talks since 2006.\n\n\n\nthe meeting will discuss the north's potential participation in the winter olympics being held feb. 9-25 in pyeongchang, south korea, as well as ways to ease the tensions after several months of provocative missile launches by the north and the isolated country's sixth nuclear test in september.\n\n\n\nboth sides appear to hope that the olympics can be a platform for improving relations between the neighbors.\n\nmore:kim jong un's purported birthday is no holiday in north korea\n\nmore:china clamps down on north korea trade as part of u.n. sanctions\n\nnorth korean dictator kim jong un said in a new year's day address that the olympics would be a good occasion to show the greatness of the korean people and suggested that pyongyang was willing to send a delegation to the games.\n\n\n\nchang ung, north korea's representative to the international olympic committee, told reporters at beijing's international airport on saturday that his country is likely to participate in the winter games, japan's kyodo news agency reported.\n\nnorth korea would likely send figure skating pair ryom tae ok and kim ju sik to the games. they captured a bronze medal last february at the asian winter games in japan.\n\n\n\nsouth korean president moon jae in has repeatedly said he wants the pyeongchang olympics to be a means for re-engagement and conflict resolution with the north.\n\n\n\ni will strive to make the pyeongchang olympics the 'peace olympics' and furthermore to peacefully resolve the north korean nuclear issue so that this can be a year when peace is cultivated on the korean peninsula, moon said friday.\n\n\n\nmoon also said he wouldn't take a soft stance with the north and vowed to strengthen south korea's military. i won't be weak-kneed or just focus on dialogue, as we did in the past, moon said.\n\nthe remarks were seen as way to placate conservatives in south korea, who are skeptical of talks with the north.\n\ncritics in south korea have expressed concern that the north will use the olympics as a way to skirt international sanctions and try to drive a wedge between seoul and washington.\n\nthe united states agreed to south korea's request to delay joint military exercises during the winter games last week during a phone call between president trump and moon.\n\nthe two leaders agreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against north korea and to not repeat mistakes of the past, the white house said.\n\ntrump said over the weekend that he supported north korean participation in the olympics and hoped the talks would extend further.\n\ni would love to see them take it beyond the olympics, he said. and at the appropriate time, we'll get involved, trump added, while at the camp david presidential retreat saturday.\n\ntrump said he would be willing to speak directly with kim, but doubled down on his tough talk against north korea's communist leader.\n\nhe knows i'm not messing around, not even a little bit, trump said.\n\nnikki haley, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, said trump's comments didn't indicate a change in policy. there is no turnaround, she said sunday on abc's this week.\n\nwhat he has basically said is, 'yes, there could be a time where we talk to north korea, but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. they have to stop testing. they have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.' ... what we're trying to do is make sure we don't repeat what's happened the last 25 years, she said.\n\ntuesday's agenda in sorting out matters related to the olympics includes whether the north's delegation would travel to the games by land and whether the two koreas will march under a unified korean flag during the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nalso at stake are the costs of accommodations and other expenses. the international olympic committee has said it is willing to cover north korea's costs if pyongyang takes part in the games, but some have questioned whether that would violate united nations sanctions imposed on the north for its missile and nuclear tests.\n\nsouth korea's unification minister, cho myoung gyon, hoped the discussion of the olympics paves the way for better ties.\n\nit is good that the resumption of inter-korean talks could set the tone for an improvement in ties between the two koreas, and better relations could become a small catalyst for helping resolving the north korean nuclear issue, he told reporters friday.
nancy armour\n\nusa today sports\n\nthere are no failed coaches in the nfl, only ones who haven't been rehired yet.\n\nat least, that's how it seems at this time of year. as sure as there will be a flurry of pink slips around the nfl after the end of the regular season, so it is, too, that the various wish lists will look remarkably similar, the names on them all familiar.\n\nmike shanahan, 63, has been off the sidelines for two years, and you can still see the smoke from the dumpster fire he left in washington. he might have two super bowl rings, but he's won only one playoff game without that guy named elway.\n\nnfl coaching carousel: breaking down every hire\n\nchip kelly's final season in philadelphia was such a train wreck eagles owner jeffrey lurie didn't bother waiting for the end of the season to get rid of him. his questionable personnel moves (yeah, demarco murray was a huge upgrade over lesean mccoy), personality quirks and 6-9 record this year were bad enough, but you cross a line when you mess with a team's annual holiday party.\n\ndoug marrone is not exactly what you'd call loyal or successful, and pat shurmur has been less than overwhelming as a head coach and an offensive coordinator.\n\nyet if rumors and league sources are to be believed, all of them are candidates for some of the six jobs – and counting – that are available. should sean payton decide he needs a change of scenery, or the new orleans saints make that decision for him, the coaching carousel will screech to a halt to let him board, too.\n\nprobably even let him have his pick of horses.\n\neven tom coughlin, who is 69 and three years removed from his last winning season, surely got a few phone calls after saying tuesday he's not necessarily done with coaching.\n\nbell: one pressing question for every nfl playoff team\n\nthe nfl is a bottom-line business, no question. but when owners are spending the equivalent of a small country's gdp on player salaries, they tend to be leery of taking a flyer on someone who could as easily be the next marty mornhinweg as he could be bill belichick.\n\nor, put more simply, you don't let your 16-year-old have the first test drive of your new ferrari, even if he or she did just ace the driver's test.\n\nthere are owners who will take a chance on highly regarded coordinators, especially if they're familiar with them or the coach-to-be has the right connections. but more often than not, they'll go with someone who's got experience -- even when that experience ought to come with a disclaimer and anti-nausea pills.\n\nhow else to explain norv turner being a head coach for three teams despite having seven winning seasons in 15 years? or eric mangini landing on his feet after his new york jets ended the 2008 season in a tailspin.\n\nafc wild-card matchup previews: chiefs at texans, steelers at bengals\n\nheck, rex ryan was out of work for all of two weeks despite winning 26 games in his last four seasons as jets coach. should ryan find himself out of work if the buffalo bills falter again next season, you can be sure another team will be waiting to snatch him and his penchant for lofty promises.\n\nsee, owners are always certain it will be different with their team. that the mistakes a coach made in his first stop will help him avoid similar pitfalls in the second. or third. maybe even fourth.\n\nafter all, belichick wasn't the second coming of vince lombardi when he was in cleveland. far from it. pete carroll looked as if he was better suited for the college game until he went to seattle. the folks in philadelphia would probably give just about anything to have andy reid back right about now.\n\nbut more often than not, they are the exception to the rule.\n\nhiring an experienced coach, even one with baggage, might seem like a shortcut to success. just remember that the guy who seems like the answer to all of your problems was once the source of someone else's.\n\nfollow nancy armour on twitter@nrarmour\n\nphotos: nfl coaching carousel
it's easy to want clarity on what the philadelphia eagles have to do following a season that will mercifully end sunday.\n\nbut first, the eagles have to decide on their quarterback, their head coach and their general manager.\n\nonce they do that, they can decide how to fix a season that went horribly wrong in so many ways.\n\nrest assured, something will change on a team that is 4-10-1 heading into its finale against the washington football team on sunday night. it's even likely that eagles president and ceo jeffrey lurie already knows what he wants to do.\n\nwhere could he go? five potential nfl landing spots for carson wentz if he leaves eagles\n\neric bieniemy is ready to be head coach:which nfl team will finally take him?\n\nthe eagles' dream has already been messed up.\n\nhere is a look at each possible scenario for the eagles' offseason:\n\n1. keep the status quo\n\nthe easiest solution, of course, is for lurie to keep general manager howie roseman, head coach doug pederson and quarterback carson wentz as the starter.\n\nthat way, the eagles can keep the framework in place in which wentz remains the franchise quarterback. it will then be up to roseman to improve the players around him and pederson to coach them better.\n\nthat seems to be the preference of pederson, who again on friday expressed confidence that he will return for 2021. he said he will meet with lurie, as he always does after a season, early next week.\n\nbut if pederson is returning, he said his priority is fixing wentz, who will finish the season sitting for the last 4 1/2 games while rookie jalen hurts took over.\n\nwentz completed a career-low 57.4% of his passes before he was benched dec. 6 in favor of rookie jalen hurts. he also threw an nfl-high 15 interceptions and has been sacked a league-high 50 times.\n\nit's a big dropoff from his previous four seasons.\n\ni think these last four games have allowed carson to just kind of take a step back and just evaluate and just see and work on some things that we've helped him with, and things that we continue to help him with as we move forward, pederson said.\n\nthat's probably been the biggest thing that's come out of these last couple of weeks. listen, i've got a ton of confidence in carson wentz and always have. our offseason is going to be geared towards getting things fixed as quarterbacks, and obviously as a team, and that falls on my shoulder.\n\non the one hand, the eagles can make the case that much of wentz's struggles stemmed from the injury-ravaged offensive line in which jason kelce was the only starter to make it through the entire season in addition to a wide receiver corps led by rookies and first-year players.\n\nthe eagles will end up using 14 different line combinations in their 16 games, an nfl record. two starters – left tackle andre dillard and right guard brandon brooks – missed the entire season. and three others – right tackle lane johnson, left guard isaac seumalo and left tackle/right guard jason peters – missed at least seven games.\n\npeters, who will turn 39 years old in january, is the only one in that group who's not expected back.\n\ni look at the injuries and that's something we've got to talk about in the offseason, pederson said. we've got to discuss that and see if i need to change up practice or if i need to maybe practice harder or be more physical in training camp.\n\nthe quarterback, whether it's wentz or hurts, will also have an entire offseason with young receivers in jalen reagor, john hightower and quez watkins.\n\nthat didn't happen last spring because of the pandemic.\n\nthe more you do things, the more repetition, the more chemistry, is always better, reagor said. getting an offseason, being able to do otas, will only make us better because we'll be around each other more, so it's kind of self-explanatory.\n\nbut if lurie truly believes in roseman and pederson – they did lead the eagles to their first-ever super bowl victory just three years ago – he could bring in a senior-type adviser to help with the draft, free agency and other type of decisions.\n\nhe could also force pederson to give up play-calling duties on offense. pederson has been reluctant to give up play-calling duties in the past, even though he admitted doing just that from time to time during the season.\n\n2. fire roseman\n\nroseman's draft record has been spotty at best since he got full control over personnel decisions in 2016.\n\nto his credit, roseman hit on all five his 2018 draft picks, most notably with tight end dallas goedert and defensive end josh sweat, along with running back miles sanders in the second round of 2019.\n\nbut he also missed badly on several others, most notably with cornerbacks sidney jones and rasul douglas in the second and third rounds, respectively, of the 2017 draft, and wide receiver j.j. arcega-whiteside in the second round of 2019.\n\nthose misses are glaringly evident on this team.\n\nthe most egregious part about arcega-whiteside, who was a healthy scratch in four games this season, is that seattle took dk metcalf seven picks after arcega-whiteside. metcalf has 1,282 yards receiving this season. arcega-whiteside has 45.\n\nand while reagor has a chance to be a good nfl wide receiver, roseman, picking 21st in the first round, took reagor over justin jefferson, who went with the very next pick to the minnesota vikings.\n\njefferson has 1,267 yards receiving while reagor, who missed five games to have thumb surgery, has 381.\n\nbut roseman's problems don't stop there.\n\nthe eagles are expected to be as much as $70 million over the salary cap in 2021, meaning that they'll have little flexibility to go after a marquee free agent even after releasing several veterans and/or restructuring contracts.\n\nwentz's contract, meanwhile, is quickly becoming an albatross. if the eagles were to release wentz, he would count $59.2 million in dead money against the salary cap. that would add another $25 million to their estimated $70 million cap deficit.\n\nif they were to trade wentz, the eagles would still be on the hook for a $34 million dead money charge for 2021.\n\nthe eagles experienced a similar situation with wide receiver alshon jeffery this season. he would have counted $26 million in dead money had he been released last spring. ideally, that would have happened because jeffery was already in decline and coming off foot surgery.\n\ninstead, the eagles kept jeffery, even as he missed eight games to start the season. he has just six catches for 115 yards in seven games. roseman also traded for desean jackson in the spring of 2019. he will end up playing in only eight of a possible 33 games.\n\na new general manager would certainly have quite a mess to clean up.\n\nthe eagles have 12 players who will count at least $10 million against the salary cap next season. that means that many veterans, such as tight end zach ertz, jeffery, jackson, defensive tackle malik jackson, likely won't be returning.\n\nbut it could also mean defensive tackle fletcher cox, defensive end brandon graham, right tackle lane johnson and perhaps even right guard brandon brooks will have to rework their contracts in order to stay.\n\nperhaps that new gm is already on staff as the nfl network reported last week that former kansas city chiefs and cleveland browns gm john dorsey has been working as a consultant for the past few months.\n\nif there is a change at general manager, whether it's dorsey or someone else, that will likely mean a new coach is coming, too. then again, if it's dorsey, it's possible that pederson could stay. pederson was the offensive coordinator under andy reid when dorsey was the general manager in kansas city.\n\nstill, if the franchise goes with a new general manager and head coach, it's likely the eagles might be trying to get high enough in the draft to take a quarterback in either ohio state's justin fields or byu's zach wilson, assuming that clemson's trevor lawrence will go first overall to jacksonville.\n\nbut that also means at least a few years of rebuilding, a luxury that roseman and pederson likely won't get even if they do return.\n\n3. fire pederson\n\nit's possible that lurie could decide that a coaching change is necessary.\n\non the one hand, wentz had by far his worst season, and pederson either couldn't or wouldn't get him on the move more; pederson said earlier in the season that wentz was dynamic.\n\nthen there was this from sanders when asked what went wrong this season: just not a lot of smart football throughout the whole season through all positions, throughout the team. as far as offensively, not very good execution from everybody, including myself, a lot of turnovers, including myself. i feel like a lot of things went wrong.\n\npederson didn't have a lot to work with, and it's safe to say that no one expected wentz to regress as much as he did.\n\non the other hand, if lurie and/or roseman were to determine that hurts is the answer at quarterback, then perhaps lurie might want to go after oklahoma coach lincoln riley, who coached hurts in 2019, one year after he coached kyler murray, who's now a rising star with the arizona cardinals.\n\nlurie has always envisioned the eagles as an innovative, cutting-edge offensive team. it's why he hired chip kelly as head coach in 2013 after watching kelly's fast-paced offense at oregon.\n\nbefore that, it was andy reid and his west coast offense that he learned from mike holmgren, who was a disciple of bill walsh.\n\neven pederson fit that bill when he was hired in 2016.\n\nso if lurie and/or roseman were to determine that quarterbacks who can throw and run, such as hurts and murray, are the wave of the future, then it's quite possible that he would want an innovative young coach to develop hurts.\n\nif it's not riley, then it could be chiefs current offensive coordinator under reid in eric bienemy. after all, they have helped patrick mahomes become the top quarterback in the nfl.\n\nbut there will be changes, whether it's in players, pederson's coaching staff, pederson himself, or the front-office structure.\n\neven the players know this.\n\ni would love for everybody to be here, but this is the way this business is, sanders said. we're going to have a whole different team next year and that's how it is every year.\n\nhonestly, i wish everybody could stay ... i hope i'm still here.\n\nsanders' return is one of the few things that's practically guaranteed.\n\ncontact martin frank at

mark zuckerberg is doing away with new year's resolutions like learning mandarin and overcoming public speaking fears for something more long-term.\n\nthe facebook chief executive announced thursday in a blog post that he plans to focus on goals in 2020 and beyond.\n\nrather than having year-to-year challenges, i've tried to think about what i hope the world and my life will look in 2030 so i can make sure i'm focusing on those things, zuckerberg wrote.\n\nthis shift comes after a trying 2019 for the tech giant. in july, facebook was fined a record-breaking $5 billion by the federal trade commission for violating consumers' privacy.\n\nnow, the road ahead looks more like helping small businesses and philanthropic efforts for the next generation.\n\nby then, if things go well, my daughter max will be in high school, we'll have the technology to feel truly present with another person no matter where they are, and scientific research will have helped cure and prevent enough diseases to extend our average life expectancy by another 2.5 years, he said.\n\npolitical ads:facebook will still allow but give users options on what they see\n\nfacebook says:it's cracking down on deepfakes, manipulated media\n\nwhat you can do to stop its spread:facebook disinformation in the 2020 presidential election\n\nso what's on facebook's radar for the next decade? the tech executive's goals includes five focus areas:\n\ngenerational change\n\na new private social network\n\ndecentralization of opportunity\n\nthe next computing platform\n\nnew forms of governance\n\nbut the biggest question stemming from zuckerberg's top five is: how should we govern the large new digital communities that the internet has enabled?\n\nover the years, facebook has been in the hot seat for its many controversial policies and initiatives as tensions continue to rise around the push to break up big tech.\n\nplatforms like facebook have to make tradeoffs on social values we all hold dear – like between free expression and safety, or between privacy and law enforcement, or between creating open systems and locking down data and access, he said.\n\ni don't think private companies should be making so many important decisions that touch on fundamental democratic values.\n\nand with that, zuckerberg introduced his solution of the creation of an independent oversight board. the board's focus will be to handle appeals for content decisions.\n\nwhile, this is just one of many proposed solutions surrounding zuckerberg's 10-year plan, the road to 2030 looks quite ambitious. it could even include more accountability.\n\nthis decade, i hope to use my position to establish more community governance and more institutions like this, zuckerberg said. if this is successful, it could be a model for other online communities in the future.
john anderson\n\nfor green bay press-gazette\n\ni am looking for news on the (green bay) packers search for a (general manager) but instead am struck cold by the headline in this very paper — sears to close green bay store.\n\nthis cannot be. this is not right. this is … this is heartbreaking.\n\nsears has closed hundreds of stores across the country the past few years, i know this. it's not a new headline. however, until today (monday), i hadn't considered the possibility that corporate decision-makers would shutter this sears. my sears!\n\nthis isn't just some sears store to me any more than lambeau field is just some stadium or john wayne is just some cowboy or frank sinatra is just some singer.\n\nno. where most see just a department store, i see family history.\n\njan. 10:sears 'will consider all other options' if refinancing fails, ceo eddie lampert warns\n\njan. 4:is your local kmart or sears closing?\n\ni don't make it from infancy in iowa to the sportscenter anchor desk at espn without this sears. does not happen. my life is tethered to the brown brick building at the corner of military and mason. actually, it's sixth street, but we won't worry about the precise location until i learn to ride a bike and my mom needs to know exactly where i am at all times.\n\nmy mother is a 24-year-old widow with a 3-year-old daughter and a 6-month-old son. it's november 1965 when her husband, my father, is killed in a car crash on a gravel road in rural iowa.\n\ni will never know my kenny anderson. my sister can recall some. my mom has all the memories, and in 1965, there are some hard days.\n\nthe three of us live in a small house in mason city, iowa. a place made famous as river city by music man composer meredith wilson. there are good neighbors on either side of us. dear friends who help look out for us.\n\na few months pass and in february 1966, larry neville, the neighbor on the left as you face our front door, gets transferred to be head of the appliance department at a new sears store in green bay. larry was born in green bay and this is a chance for him and his wife, verna, to return home.\n\nthat summer, my mom takes us to green bay to visit the nevilles. there's something about it that feels right. something warm and inviting. i wonder if it would have felt that way in winter?\n\nby the end of the year, mom needs a change. iowa is home and all of her family is there, but so too is my father's memory. change can't erase all the sadness, but it can take away the everyday reminders. change is a chance to reset and move forward.\n\njan. 4:100+ kmart, sears stores to close this spring\n\ndec. 31:sears bought few national tv ads during the holiday season, data show\n\nso as 1967 dawns, she follows the nevilles' lead and we move.\n\nit is january. it is cold. but it still feels right.\n\nmy sister and i will grow up green bay: the packers, paper mills, kennedy elementary school, lombardi, southwest, fish on fridays.\n\nthe sears store has made it so.\n\nfrom there, my sears tale is mostly retail. everything a kid could possibly imagine needing — clothes, winter clothes, shoes, sporting goods, records. and everything he can't imagine needing — carpet, drapes, house paint, tires and tools.\n\nas i grow up, i wear out sears' indestructible toughskins jeans like they are brown paper bags. the holes i make in the knees are patched with swaths of denim transplanted from pairs of jeans i'd outgrown the year before. the denim cycle of life if you will.\n\nmy mother remarries. my father is gone but i have a dad, walter collins, the best man i've ever known. he loves us unconditionally. he also loves tools on the condition they are craftsman tools from sears.\n\ntools are birthday gifts and christmas gifts for dad and my stepbrothers.\n\nfor my sister, there are barry manilow albums (yes, i know the lyrics but only because she played them loudly and repeatedly) and andy gibb 45s.\n\ndec. 26:is 2018 the end of the road for sears or toys r us?\n\ndec. 20:here are the 26 retailers and apparel companies most at risk in 2018\n\nmom? if it has a bow on it, she'll love it.\n\nfor me — what wouldn't i like to have? but if i must pick just one thing, then it's the football shirt (these are the days before the nfl cashed in on merchandising) with an action photo that looks remarkably like john brockington on the front.\n\nthe building with the giant swan-like s on its side is our destination.\n\nmy friends and i have bikes and allowance money.\n\nwe've biked the route a thousand times, beginning from my house on biemeret street (as vexing to spell today at age 52 as it was when filling out forms in grade school).\n\naround the corner and down katers drive we go. hang a right on langlade. then a left through the parking lots of a restaurant and gas station/convenience store. be careful at the intersection of ninth and military. i can still hear my mom imploring me to this day, please, be careful when crossing at ninth and military!\n\nthe whole trip is a ride past buildings that remain today but places that are long gone: the village inn, western gas station, red owl, st. agnes bakery, the water tower, ponderosa, van boxtel ford.\n\nfinally, we arrive at sears. always the backside of the store. military and sixth. the merchandise pick-up entrance by the automotive garage bays. come to think of it, i'm not sure i've ever gone in the front door of the place. we shop, we look, we loiter, we even, sometimes, buy. childhood at its best.\n\neventually, we graduate to the city bus and trips to port plaza mall. then we graduate high school and college and i move to oklahoma, arizona and connecticut. i have a family of my own. and when our house needs a new washer and dryer, naturally, we go to sears.\n\nand i tell my kids for the umpteenth time about the sears in my hometown. they know the one. the one that brought nana and auntie les and dad to green bay.\n\nit's more than a store. it's my story.\n\njohn anderson is a journalist and an anchor of espn's sportscenter. this column first appeared in the green bay press-gazette.
orrin g. hatch\n\nright now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in latin america, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. joshua holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding american citizen, was arrested by venezuelan authorities in june 2016 and jailed on false charges. his health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\njosh's story is the nightmare of any american traveling abroad.\n\nmore:iran unrest threatens tehran's tyrants. can protesters drive them out?\n\nmore:on immigration, trump is positioned to do what obama and bush couldn't\n\njosh first flew to venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, thamara caleno holt, a young venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. in clear violation of the vienna convention, venezuelan authorities not only denied josh medical attention but also barred access to u.s. consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nfor months, josh's case has languished in venezuelan courts. and while venezuelan authorities dither, josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. with his case scheduled to move to trial in january, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if u.s. officials will even be able to help josh in legal proceedings. the venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nthe tragedy is that josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. i know josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. as a case in point, josh served for two years as a mormon missionary in washington prior to his marriage. it was in this setting that he learned spanish and developed a deep love for the hispanic people, culture and customs. that he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nfrom the time of josh's arrest last year, i have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. i have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of state rex tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with venezuelan authorities. i even raised the issue of josh's captivity with president trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on venezuela and called on president nicolas maduro to set josh free.\n\nas a leader looking to do what is good and just, president maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of josh and thamy on humanitarian grounds. this action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. with this gesture of goodwill, the governments of venezuela and the united states could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nthe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and i invite president maduro to take the first step. doing so would bring relief to the holt family and usher in a new era of u.s.-venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\n\nmore:the second 'persian spring' is upon us. here's how we can make it last.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nvenezuela and the united states have significant policy differences, to be sure. but working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent american and his wife, who is herself a native of venezuela. josh and thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\n\nas the senior member and former chairman of the senate judiciary committee, i recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. but i believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\n\nthat's why president maduro should release josh and thamy holt. he must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\n\ni call on him to help us bring josh home.\n\norrin hatch is the senior senator from utah, and president pro tempore of the united states senate.
wendy r. sherman\n\nopinion columnist\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. he was forced to postpone his trip to kyiv, ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in iraq. as fraught as pompeo's visit to kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, iraq trumped kyiv after the new year's eve attack on the u.s. embassy in baghdad.\n\nit is president donald trump's failed policy toward iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\n\niraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 u.s. invasion that upended the middle east and cost so much in u.s. lives and treasure. but iraq also created strange bedfellows. the u.s. troops worked alongside iraqi and iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the islamic state terrorism group. and even as washington was confronting iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in iraq, where tehran holds considerable sway.\n\nthat uneasy balance was destroyed when trump withdrew from the joint comprehensive plan of action, better known as the iran nuclear deal. like other critics of the agreement, trump believed it should have resolved all of america's issues with iran. trump believed we were giving tehran benefits without a requisite return. he thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\n\ntrump policies devastate us interests\n\nlike much of trump's national security and foreign policy, his iran approach is tactical and not strategic. the results have been devastating to u.s. interests. iran's most extreme hard-liners, the iranian revolutionary guards corps (irgc) and quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the united states couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\n\niran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. indeed, the irgc has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under trump's sanctions. and iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\n\nlearning to manage conflict:as iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\n\nin iraq, iranian-backed militia, led by kataeb hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. a rocket attack by the kataeb hezbollah militia last friday killed an american contractor and injured many. the trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the new year's eve attack on our embassy.\n\nmost would agree that the united states had to respond in some way to the death of an american, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\n\nregardless, if the trump administration really understood the dynamics of iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the u.s. embassy. administration officials might have worked more closely with the iraq government to think through the best way forward. instead, in essence, trump walked into iran's trap.\n\nfor many americans, the baghdad militia chants of death to america echoed the takeover of the u.s. embassy in tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\n\niran nuclear deal was solid progress\n\nthe immediate emergency at our embassy in baghdad has subsided. kataeb hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to america. they want the 5,000 u.s. troops out of iraq.\n\nnonetheless, perhaps even pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\n\ntrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw american troops from just about everywhere. but a withdrawal from iraq at this moment only serves iran's desire to exert greater control over iraq. to much of the world, it would signal u.s. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\n\neven some of the harshest critics of the iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. the iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. such a capability would project even greater iranian power in the middle east and deter the ability of washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\n\ndiplomatic amateur hour:sondland's impeachment testimony proves trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\n\nconcerted action to curtail iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. had trump stayed in the iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the u.s. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\n\nthree years into his presidency, donald trump owns the events and outcomes in iraq and iran, as he does in north korea, afghanistan, venezuela, the middle east, russia, china and hong kong. having diminished our state department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\n\nthe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of state's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\n\nwendy r. sherman, a professor and the director of the center for public leadership at harvard kennedy school, was undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2011-15 and led u.s. negotiations on the iran nuclear deal. she is a member of usa today's board of contributors and the author of not for the faint of heart: lessons in courage, power and persistence. follow her on twitter: @wendyrsherman
washington – marking a dramatic conclusion to a bitter election, vice president mike pence is set to preside wednesday over a special joint session of congress that will cement president-elect joe biden's election win – and a loss for president donald trump and himself.\n\nthe scene sets the stage for perhaps the most contentious electoral vote count in 144 years after trump worked two months to overturn biden's nov. 3 election victory.\n\nthe usually perfunctory joint sessions have had past moments of tension. vice president al gore oversaw his presidential election loss against george w. bush after a fiercely fought recount battle in florida decided by the supreme court.\n\naudiotape:trump is heard on recording pressuring georgia secretary of state to 'find' votes\n\nas trump encourages protests wednesday in washington – and republicans in congress oppose certification – this year's session could be the most divisive since the election of 1876.\n\nfurther heightening the tensions is an audiotape obtained by the washington post in which trump pressures georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse his loss to biden in georgia.\n\nat wednesday's joint session of congress, pence, serving in his capacity as president of the senate, will be tasked with opening the electoral certificates from each state alphabetically to count the votes. at the session's conclusion, pence, like gore 20 years ago, is supposed to announce the winner.\n\nbiden defeated trump 306-232 in the electoral college vote dec. 14,but procedural fireworks are expected throughout. a faction of house republicans, led by mo brooks, r-ala., intends to object to electoral votes from some states. sen. josh hawley, r-mo., sen. ted cruz, r-texas, and 10 other senators said they will sign on to the objections.\n\nmore:a dozen republican senators plan to object to certification of biden's election win over trump\n\nthe effort lacks the votes in the democratic-controlled house and the republican-led senate. although it wouldn't be the first time a president-elect's electoral votes were contested by members of the opposing party – it happened in 2001, 2005 and 2017, each led by democrats – none of these instances had the level of republican resistance expected wednesday.\n\nhere are some of the past dramatic and controversial moments in congress' counting of electoral college votes:\n\n1877: hayes-tilden dispute comes close to constitutional crisis\n\nthe election of 1876, won by republican rutherford b. hayes over democrat samuel tilden, remains the most fiercely contested in u.s. history – even after the 2000 election and last november's election.\n\n'it really is over now': the 24 hours that probably thwarted trump's effort to overturn the election\n\nthe two parties in florida, south carolina, louisiana and oregon both claimed victories and submitted electoral votes from rival slates of electors, presenting a constitutional crisis before congress.\n\na fight also ensued over the electoral votes of vermont, won by hayes but contested by tilden.\n\ncongress established a bipartisan electoral commission to reach a solution. through the compromise of 1877, hayes emerged the winner after he appeased southern democrats by agreeing to pull federal troops out of the south and ushering in the end of reconstruction.\n\n'the moment of truth': the electoral college prepares to hand trump the loss he refuses to accept\n\nhayes won vermont, florida, south carolina and louisiana, leading him to a 185-184 electoral win, the narrowest in u.s. history.\n\nwe came within two days of having simultaneous inauguration ceremonies, which would have been intolerable because you can't have two presidents, said ned foley, director of the election law program at ohio state university's moritz college of law. it was a very dicey situation.\n\n1961: nixon declares rival kennedy the winner\n\nvice president richard nixon, who lost to democrat john f. kennedy in the presidential election months before, presided over the joint session of congress on jan. 6, 1961, that declared his rival kennedy the winner.\n\nkennedy won the popular vote by a narrow 113,000 votes and the electoral college by a wider 303-219. the republican party challenged results in 11 states.\n\nthe only state that had an outcome change was hawaii – from nixon to kennedy. the state initially certified nixon as the winner, but a post-election recount found kennedy won hawaii by 115 votes.\n\nit meant votes from rival slates of hawaii electors – one for kennedy, the other for nixon – were presented to congress. nixon, as president of the senate, counted hawaii's three electoral votes for kennedy and recognized the massachusetts democrat as the new president.\n\nspeaking from the house chair, nixon noted it was the first time in 100 years that a candidate for president was forced to announce the result of an election that he lost. he said he could not think of a more striking and eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system.\n\nin our campaigns, no matter how hard fought they may be, no matter how close the election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win, nixon said. it is in that spirit that i now declare that john f. kennedy has been elected president of the united states, and lyndon b. johnson vice president of the united states.\n\n1969: vp humphrey misses vote for nixon\n\nlike nixon and gore, vice president hubert humphrey was in line to preside over the certification of his own loss in 1969. nixon defeated humphrey in the election in 1968.\n\nbut humphrey, the democratic vice president of lyndon b. johnson, did not attend the joint congressional session. it's the most recent time in u.s. history that the senate speaker pro tempore, sen. richard russell, d-ga., had to fill in for the vice president as congress counted electoral votes.\n\n'democracy prevailed': joe biden passes 270-vote threshold to win electoral college\n\nhumphrey was in oslo, norway, attending the funeral of trygve lie, the first elected secretary-general of the united nations.\n\nif pence were to miss the joint session, sen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, the speaker pro tempore, would lead the meeting.\n\nthe session on jan. 6, 1969, had another distinction: rep. james o'hara, d-mich., filed the first formal objection to the electoral college count in u.s. history when he opposed one of north carolina's 13 electoral votes that went to segregationist george wallace. sen. edmund muskie, d-maine, humphrey's running-mate, signed on.\n\nthe vote for wallace came from a faithless north carolina elector who was pledged to vote for nixon. o'hara's effort failed in the senate and house, and the single electoral vote went to wallace.\n\n2001: gore declares bush the winner and gavels down objections\n\nas democrats decried that a conservative supreme court robbed their candidate of a win in florida, gore presided over the certification of his loss against bush in 2001.\n\nit came less than one month after gore, who won the popular vote over bush by 540,000 votes, lost when the supreme court stopped recount efforts in florida. bush won the state by 537 votes.\n\nmembers of the congressional house black caucus spent 20 minutes objecting as they sought to block florida's 25 electoral votes. each time, gore slammed his gavel to quiet his house allies.\n\nany objections to votes submitted by a state's electoral slates require support from one house member and one senator to be considered. no senator signed on to their effort.\n\nthe whole number of electors appointed to vote for president of the united states is 538, of which a majority is 270, gore said as he declared his opponent the winner. george w. bush, of the state of texas, has received for president of the united states 271 votes. al gore, of the state of tennessee, has received 266 votes.\n\nhe added, may god bless our new president and our new vice president, and may god bless the united states of america.\n\n2005: sen. boxer signs on to house objection\n\nin the joint meeting of congress to certify bush's win over democrat john kerry, rep. stephanie tubbs jones, d-ohio, received a senate signature to object to the electoral votes from ohio.\n\nit came from sen. barbara boxer, d-calif. the two democrats raised concerns about voting irregularities. kerry said he did not support the effort.\n\nif a senator signs onto a house objection of the electoral votes, the two chambers will meet for no more than two hours before voting on the objections. the same would happen wednesday if hawley, cruz and other republican senators object to biden's victory in a state.\n\ni hate inconveniencing my friends, but i believe it is worth a couple of hours to shine some light on these issues, boxer said at the joint sessions led by vice president dick cheney.\n\ntheir objection lost handily, receiving just one vote in the senate – boxer's – and 31 votes in the house, all from democrats.\n\n2017: biden to democrats: 'it is over'\n\nfour years ago, on jan. 6, 2017, the roles were somewhat reversed from this week's dynamics: biden presided over trump's win over democrat hillary clinton.\n\nhalf a dozen democratic house members raised formal objections to the electoral college vote count, but they lacked the backing of any senators. biden repeatedly slammed the gavel on debate, saying the objections could not be entertained.\n\nthe objections were based on russian election interference, allegations of voter suppression or what democrats considered to be illegal votes cast by republican members of the electoral college.\n\nrep. pramila jayapal, d-wash., said, mr. president, even as people waited hours in georgia...\n\nbiden stopped her: there is no debate. there is no debate. if there is not one signed by a senator, the objection cannot be entertained.\n\njayapal responded: mr. president, the objection is signed by a member of the house but not yet by a member of the senate.\n\nit is over, biden said as republicans applauded.\n\nreach joey garrison on twitter @joeygarrison.
ap\n\natlanta (ap) — the college football playoff is here to stay.\n\nthe national championship game is still trying to make its mark.\n\nthe 4-year-old title game remains a bit of an afterthought compared to the well-entrenched bowl system, from its lack of a catchy name to its scattered timing to its scaled-backed format.\n\nevery sport has its elements that fans might want to change or tweak or adjust, said burke magnus, espn's executive vice president from programming and scheduling. college football may have a few of those as well.\n\nthe four-team playoff began with the 2014 season, replacing a bcs system that matched the top two teams in a national championship game while leaving the bowls largely unchanged.\n\nnow, the six major bowls — rose, sugar, cotton, orange, peach and fiesta — rotate a pair of semifinal games that are generally played on new year's day, long the traditional end to the college football season.\n\nthe four major bowls that are not semifinals each year essentially divvy up the best of the non-playoff teams, also creating some attractive matchups. and, of course, the remaining bowls — a staggering 33 in all this season — are still around to provide a smorgasbord of postseason games/television programming from mid-december to the first day of the new year.\n\nby the time the national championship game rolls around — monday night's alabama-georgia matchup falls exactly a week after the semifinals, though the timing varies from year to year — it almost feels extraneous to the season.\n\nbill hancock, executive director of the college football playoff, doesn't view it that way.\n\nwe see it as a three-game package, he said. the championship game becomes the iconic event. it is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nthis season's semifinal games were highlighted by a thrilling rose bowl , in which georgia rallied to beat oklahoma 54-48 in a double overtime. the television ratings were huge, an average of 27 million viewers across espn and espn2 — a 39 percent increase over last year's early semifinal.\n\nthe ratings dipped for the nightcap, alabama's methodical 24-6 victory clemson in a rematch of the last two national championship games, but the 21.1 million viewers were still a 10 percent increase over the previous year's second semifinal.\n\nthe national championship game will surely surpass the sugar bowl ratings, but it may have a hard time matching those rose bowl numbers — especially given the all-southeastern conference title game.\n\nlast year's national championship game drew about 26.7 million viewers.\n\nthe semifinals are obviously important, sec commissioner greg sankey said. this year, you had two traditional games on new year's day that i think magnified it.\n\nbut, he quickly added, i don't look at this game as taking a back seat to anything.\n\nthe tv ratings highlight some of the challenges facing the championship game.\n\nnew year's day remains the capper to the season for many college football fans. most of them have the day off from work and it's simply ingrained in the culture to cap off the holiday season by plopping in front of the television to take in games that stretch from morning to midnight. the rose bowl, which traditionally kicks off late afternoon eastern time, is almost guaranteed huge ratings.\n\nthe rose bowl has the best television window in sports, magnus said. ever. period. not college football. sports.\n\nthe national championship game is a prime-time affair, which provides a ratings boost, but there are plenty of other viewing options on a monday night. and since many people have to work the next morning, the lack of a competitive game can be a real drain on the numbers.\n\nthe format of the national championship game also gives off a vibe that this game isn't as important as the bowls, which are played while schools are on their holiday breaks. teams often spend up to a week at the bowl sites, meeting incessantly with the media and taking part in a wide range of promotional and charity events.\n\nbut, with classes resuming at the start of the new year, the national championship game is merely a long weekend . the teams arrive on friday, hold one big session with the media on saturday, get in their last practice, and then turn their attention to the game.\n\norganizers have attempted to spice things up for the fans.\n\nin atlanta, a series of concerts was held throughout the weekend at centennial olympic park, though frigid weather put a damper on things. borrowing a page from the super bowl, breakout star kendrick lamar is set to perform as part of the title game's first-ever halftime performance.\n\nstill, the college football playoff is up against some of the same issues as the final four in men's basketball.\n\nfor hoops fans, there's nothing like the saturday semifinals, with back-to-back games a mere half-hour apart, matching the four best teams in the land. the national championship game, played two nights later in the same venue, often comes across as a letdown.\n\nthat's even more of an issue for college football. over its first four years, the championship game has been held anywhere from week to 11 days after the semifinals, a gap will continue to vary from year to year depending on how the calendar shakes out. organizers are still tinkering with the format.\n\nin 2019, for instance, the peach and fiesta semifinal games are set to be played on saturday, dec. 28. the championship game will be held on jan. 13 — a whopping 15 days later.\n\nhancock believes time will settle many of the issues facing the championship game.\n\nthis'll be the 80th year of the final four. it's the fourth cfp, he said. i'm really proud of the position where we

a new episode of mlb network presents focuses on mets manager terry collins, who reached the world series for the first time in his four-decade professional baseball career in 2015. the program covers collins' career as a minor-league utility player — during which he once rode the bench for 52 straight games — and his prior stints as a big-league manager in both houston and anaheim.\n\nbut the last segment dives into the 2015 world series, and specifically collins' decision to leave matt harvey in to pitch the ninth inning of the deciding game 5. collins intended to take harvey out for closer jeurys familia, but harvey argued his way back to the mound only to allow a walk and a double to the first two batters he faced. the royals tied the game that inning and went on to win the series with a 7-2 victory in 12 innings.\n\ncollins talked about his decision in the show, saying that he still believes it was the wrong one but he has moved on:\n\ni saw the passion in his eyes — 'i want this game.' that's why i think he's great, and i think that's what's going to make him great: he wants to compete. and he wants to compete on the biggest stage, and in the biggest moment. so i gave him that chance…. i don't know what would have happened after that, but in my mind, we should have made the change. i had my bad three days. i let it bother me for three days and then i said, 'look, you've got to move on. you're going to kill yourself over this, and it's too late. it's over.'\n\nmlb network presents: terry collins, a life in baseball debuts tuesday night at 9 p.m. et.
trying to get out of the garden state? you may not be alone.\n\naccording to an annual study from united van lines, new jersey was the top state people were moving out of in 2018, while vermont topped the list as the top state people moved to.\n\nthe company, which has tracked interstate moves for the study since 1977, used data from the more than 200,000 household moves it completed in 2018 within the 48 contiguous states and washington, d.c.\n\nthe data showed that roughly two-thirds of new jersey moves were outbound in 2018. new jersey has been in the top 10 for outbound moves for the past 10 years, united van lines said.\n\nillinois (65.9%), connecticut (62%), new york (61.5%) and kansas (58.7%) rounded out the top five list for states people were leaving.\n\non the other hand, over 7 in 10 moves in vermont were inbound in 2018. among the other states that people moved to: oregon (63.8%), idaho (62.4%), nevada (61.8%) and arizona (60.2%).\n\naccording to united van lines, the data overall shows a growing number of moves to western and southern regions, while northeastern states saw a growing number of moves away.\n\nthe data collected by united van lines aligns with longer-term migration patterns to southern and western states, trends driven by factors like job growth, lower costs of living, state budgetary challenges and more temperate climates, michael stoll, a public policy professor and economist at ucla, said in a statement.\n\ncareer changes accounted for about half of all moves across the country, according to a survey from united van lines. retirement, lifestyle change and family were also among top reasons for moving in some regions.\n\nidaho welcomed the highest percentage of movers seeking a new lifestyle at roughly 25 percent, while new mexico led the way for retirees with 42 percent of movers wrapping up their careers.\n\nunlike a few decades ago, retirees are leaving california, instead choosing other states in the pacific west and mountain west, stoll added.\n\nfollow ryan miller on twitter @ryanw_miller\n\nmore:2018 year in review: 50 stories from 50 states that moved us\n\nmore:beto o'rourke, freekah and other words you've been saying wrong all year\n\nmore:blood pressure drug recalls, mollie tibbetts, toys r us and roseanne: our most-read stories of 2018
maria puente\n\nusa today\n\na prankster climbed up a mountain in los angeles overnight to welcome the new year sunday by altering the world-famous hollywood sign to read hollyweed, police say.\n\nlos angelenos recovering from new year's eve celebrations might have been blurry-eyed as the sun came up on mount lee but they couldn't have missed noticing there was something wrong with the familiar 350-feet-long sign.\n\naccording to sgt. guy juneau, the watch commander for the los angeles police department's security services division (which handles security for public buildings and facilities), a lone gentleman made his way up the mountain, scaled a protective fence, clambered over the sign and placed two tarps covering the two os.\n\nit now reads 'weed,' juneau told usa today. he escaped but (the stunt) was captured on security video footage.\n\nbut by 10:45 a.m. p.t., the tarps had been removed and all was right once again on the hollywood sign, according to cbs los angeles' live coverage.\n\npolice are investigating and if the man is arrested, he will be prosecuted for misdemeanor trespassing, juneau said.\n\nbut it isn't the first time the sign with its 45-foot-tall letters has been vandalized; juneau says there's an incident at least once a year.\n\nit's thrill-seekers, looking for media attention, he said. it's l.a., part of our l.a.-crazy, he added, chuckling. but seriously, he said, we can't have the sign saying that.\n\npolice had to press to restore the sign quickly; finding work crews on a holiday proved difficult, he said.\n\nthe prankster may have had a political motive: celebrating california voters' approval in november of proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana, beginning in 2018.\n\nbesides hosting the sign, the mountain also is host to the communications towers used by police and fire departments, he said, which is why the police have an officer assigned to keep watch up there.\n\nand by the way, he said, it's very dangerous to climb up this mountain, located in the hollywood hills section of the santa monica mountains. the sign was put up in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real-estate development.\n\nhe took a risk, juneau said of the tarp-wielding climber. he could have been killed.\n\nif the police were unamused (or trying to be), los angelenos on twitter were laughing in their new year lattes.\n\nas someone named caesar tweeted, it might be a sign of a coming good year.\n\nsomebody changed the hollywood sign to hollyweed and if that doesn't mean that 2017 will be a good year then idk what does, he posted.
frisco, texas — the cowboys, after a week of uncertainty, announced sunday evening that jason garrett's contract will not be extended.\n\nno, the official statement from jerry jones did not say the cowboys were firing—or even terminating—their head coach of the last decade.\n\nbut for the first time in more than 12 years, garrett is no longer an employee of the dallas cowboys.\n\nthe cowboys said the team would not seek a new agreement on a contract extension with garrett. jones included a statement thanking garrett for more than 20 years with the cowboys as a player, assistant coach and then head coach.\n\njason garrett's legacy with the dallas cowboys will always be that of someone who strived for greatness every day that he walked through the door, and as someone who instilled the virtues of enthusiasm, hard work and appreciation for the profession in all of the men who played with him and for him, jones said in the statement. he is, and always will remain, a cherished member of the dallas cowboys family.\n\ngarrett texted his assistant coaches shortly after the team released a statement, a person familiar with the situation told usa today sports on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly comment on garrett's message. the head coach thanked his assistants for their time, reiterating his pride in what they accomplished during the cowboys' 8-8 2019 season and prior campaigns.\n\nassistants were not formally notified about garrett's future before jones' statement to reporters, the person said. even coaches whose contracts expired earlier last week continued to report to the star on friday after their contracts ended. not until saturday were they told by text message they no longer needed to come in. this was all part of a curious timeline that led to the team interviewing ex-nfl coaches marvin lewis and mike mccarthy, per multiple reports, before officially announcing garrett's exit sunday during the third quarter of the wild-card game between the eagles and seahawks.\n\nbut jones had long hinted at a departure. the cowboys chose not to extend garrett before 2019 as he coached the final season of his five-year deal.\n\nopinion:here's where the cowboys should look for their next head coach\n\nduring the season, too, jones consistently suggested garrett's future with the cowboys wasn't a given. he praised coaches who beat the cowboys in the aftermath of losses. he declared that dallas got outcoached following a 13-9 november loss in new england. he told usa today's jarrett bell in december that generally, my radar is turned on to other coaching candidates. jones praised coaches like urban meyer and baylor's matt rhule, also giving the not-so-convincing vote of confidence that garrett will be coaching in the nfl next year.\n\nthe cowboys part ways with their nine-year coach after he completed his fourth 8-8 season with the club. the cowboys crushed the redskins 47-16 to end the season, but dallas still finished outside the playoff picture. garrett had been the longest-tenured head coach in the nfl who had not won a super bowl and second-longest-tenured coach in franchise history.\n\ngarrett's cowboys went 85-67 from when he became the interim coach in november 2010 and then assumed the mantle in 2011. dallas won its division in three of the last six seasons but never advanced past the divisional round. since the cowboys' three super bowls in the 1990s, the team hasn't even advanced to a conference championship in 24 years.\n\nthat measuring stick was important to both jerry jones and vice president stephen jones, the two said at training camp in july, as garrett entered the final season of his five-year contract without an extension. the joneses stated their roster was more talented than the 2018 club that went 10-6, then beat the seahawks in the wild-card round. they wanted postseason production to reflect that belief.\n\nthe cowboys started the season hot with the first 3-0 open of garrett's career. but games against the struggling giants, redskins and dolphins weren't indicative of how the cowboys would perform against playoff contenders. dallas beat just two teams with a winning record and never again won in consecutive weeks after the 3-0 start. they raced to the league's best offense,averaging 431.5 yards per game. but four times they dropped matches by 4 points or fewer.\n\nyou want to be able to handle yourself well at those critical moments and we've done a good job in that in the past, garrett said. sometimes this year we have not done a good enough job.\n\nnfl newsletter:sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\neven so, jones longed for garrett to shepherd what the front office considered a talented roster over the hump. garrett has been a long-term, very important, pleasant part of my life, jones said in a more than 29-minute session with reporters on dec. 29. if he's coaching 10 more years for the cowboys or if he's not, he's done that. we've had that kind of life together.\n\nin a weak nfc east, jones maintained hope for a fairy-tale turnaround. the cowboys starters stayed mostly healthy through the season. quarterback dak prescott posted career bests with 4,902 yards and 30 touchdowns, and the offensive line allowing the fewest percentage of sacks on dropbacks of any team this season.\n\ndallas failed to translate that good fortune to wins.\n\nit cost garrett his job.\n\nplayers said they couldn't focus too much on criticism of garrett.\n\nhe's not the only one getting criticized, defensive end demarcus lawrence said after the cowboys lost control of the nfc east in december. we're all getting criticized.\n\nadded prescott of garrett's expiring contract: i think it's the last game on my [contract] as well so i'll be damned if i speak on anybody else's future or their place.\n\neven garrett declined to entertain speculation, maintaining that he did not think about his future much and would not yet. the coach who always told his cowboys players to focus on the moment — to have a good wednesday, to ready for one good series, to think only about the immediate next opponent — said he thought not a whole lot about his future. absolutely he wanted to continue coaching in the nfl and, if possible, with the cowboys.\n\nbut i have no idea, he said, if he would get that opportunity.\n\nhe knows now.\n\nfollow usa today sports' jori epstein on twitter @joriepstein.\n\nif you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you. join our facebook

david swanson\n\nreviewed.com\n\nintroduced in 2012, dolby atmos introduced moviegoers to immersive, three-dimensional audio. many consumers may be aware of the name, but aren't quite sure how it works, what the requirements are, or how to bring it into their home theater systems. samsung came to ces this year on a mission to change that.\n\nwith dolby atmos, during the mixing for a film or video game, engineers record and isolate each individual sound — from birds chirping to tires squealing — and convert them into an object. each sound object is then assigned a particular location within the theater from which to emanate, using one or more speakers to establish the location.\n\nhands-on with samsung's wireless dolby atmos soundbar\n\nwhat this means is that sounds are no longer two-dimensional, coming from one plane—left, right, or behind the viewer—but instead seem to come from all over the room. as many as 128 discrete audio tracks are isolated for theaters, requiring up to 64 speakers—a dealbreaker for even the most hardcore home audio enthusiasts. to bring dolby atmos home, the industry came up with upward-firing speakers, which allow audio to bounce off the ceiling. this helps blanket the room with sound, replicating much of the movie theater experience.\n\nalthough various manufacturers have licensed the dolby atmos name for home speaker systems over the past year, at ces samsung electronics introduced a first-ever wireless soundbar package utilizing dolby atmos technology: the hw-k950. we took a look, and bent an ear.\n\nto be clear, this is not just another soundbar.\n\nbuilding on samsung's wireless audio 360 series, the hw-k950 is both samsung's first soundbar to feature dolby atmos and the industry's first soundbar package to include a pair of atmos-capable wireless rear speakers in the box. combined, the set-up delivers powerful 5.4.1-channel sound that envelops viewers from all sides.\n\ncoming in at 47 inches wide, the soundbar is 3.25 inches in height (not 2.1 inches tall, as reported elsewhere), making it well-suited to tvs 55 inches or larger. three of the hw-k950's five speakers fire out, toward the viewers, and two project upwards.\n\nthe subwoofer is wireless (though it plugs in for power), and measures 17.75 inches in height. two rear speakers measure a modest 7.75 inches high and each has two forward and two upwards-firing speakers. at ces, samsung had a looped demo playing for the crowd in a small room near its main booth, but due to crowd noise and tight quarters it wasn't a real, fair test of the system's audio capabilities.\n\nthe key innovation here is the wireless design, which means you don't have to worry about hiding messy speaker wire. this also opens up new speaker placement options, which is important since speaker positioning is a vital component of optimal dolby atmos playback.\n\nthe soundbar package is only available in black for now, but samsung says it's continuing to expand the array of colors and styles for additional speakers, and the company promises an improved app for phones, tablets, and gear s and s2 smartwatches, for multi-room speaker placements.\n\none potential drawback is that the system is not compatible with the competing audio technology, dts:x. but initial releases for home video appear to be encoded with both formats, so this may not be an issue—especially assuming the dolby format is supported long-term.\n\nthe three-dimensional effect of dolby atmos produces a more realistic audio environment that attentive moviegoers can't help but notice. while existing movie theaters have been slow to invest in the technology in the u.s., filmmakers are eager to utilize dolby atmos. dolby says several dozen movies and tv series have been released for home consumption in the format — a number sure to multiply in the months to come. video games, like star wars: battlefront, have also begun to capitalize on the increased spatial freedom.\n\nconsumers have also been hesitant to upgrade to dolby atmos at home. the technology requires not just receiver upgrades, but new speakers as well. samsung's complete hw-k950 package delivers 5.1.4-channel sound and wireless satellites, and additional wireless speakers are available in patterns and colors that make them easier to integrate into home environments. in short, the hw-k950 appears to offer a practical and seamless solution for most living rooms. it's an attractive option for audio enthusiasts who have ruled out ceiling-fitted speakers at home.\n\nkeep in mind you'll still need to pony up for a dolby atmos compatible receiver, and pricing and a ship date for the hw-k950 have not yet been announced. while we're guessing it won't be cheap, at least the good news is you won't have to invest in a new blu-ray player at the same time.\n\nfor more in-depth ces coverage, head to reviewed.com.
few events in american history transformed our nation as momentously as the ratification of women's right to vote 100 years ago. as we approach the centennial in august, the usa today network is launching an ambitious commemoration of this major step toward the universal right to vote.\n\nwe'll provide much more than a history lesson. our project – women of the century – will inspire women, girls and their allies to work toward a better america.\n\nwe know that ratification of the 19th amendment a century ago resonates today, its echoes evident in efforts to advance women's rights in our laws, workplaces and societal expectations. the past and present are connected in an ongoing effort to secure women's futures.\n\nstarting in february, through the combined power of 260 newsrooms across the usa, we will explore this constitutional change, what it has accomplished and what's left to be done.\n\nwe'll do it through interviews with trailblazing american women from across all 50 states and the district of columbia, live events designed to empower and enfranchise, stories that cover the movement's victories and shortcomings, augmented reality experiences that bring alive the suffragists in their struggles and triumphs and much more.\n\nwe believe it's vital that you are a part of this ambitious project.\n\nin january, we ask our readers and viewers to nominate women from their towns, cities and states who have made a difference on a state or national level in areas such as arts & literature, business, civil rights, education, entertainment, law, media, nonprofits & philanthropy, politics, science & medicine and sports. we'll use your input and the help of historians, scholars and other experts to highlight more than 500 women who have inspired us over the past 100 years.\n\nyou can get started nominating women at usatoday.com/womenofthecentury/.\n\nwe won't focus solely on women in the public sphere. we are excited to announce that in connection with women of the century, the usa today network is launching womankind, an extension of our humankind franchise, to celebrate unsung women who make the world a better place through their good work and example.\n\nwe invite you to nominate women – or even yourself – on this form.\n\nwe're excited to serve as a gathering place for you to discover and remember the women who changed american history and to support and honor the women of today who keep the fight alive.
usa today\n\nyou're reading the opposing view, one of two perspectives in today's debate. for our view, read the choice between democracy and trump is easy.\n\nsen. ted cruz, r-texas, declined to provide an opposing view. excerpts from the statement sent by cruz and 10 other republican senators:\n\non january 6, it is incumbent on congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. that vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud.\n\nat that quadrennial joint session, there is long precedent of democratic members of congress raising objections to presidential election results, as they did in 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017. and, in both 1969 and 2005, a democratic senator joined with a democratic house member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged.\n\nthe most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the hayes-tilden presidential race. specifically, the elections in three states — florida, louisiana, and south carolina — were alleged to have been conducted illegally.\n\nin 1877, congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. instead, congress appointed an electoral commission — consisting of five senators, five house members, and five supreme court justices — to consider and resolve the disputed returns.\n\nwe should follow that precedent. to wit, congress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\naccordingly, we intend to vote on january 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not regularly given and lawfully certified (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed.\n\nwe are not naive. we fully expect most if not all democrats, and perhaps more than a few republicans, to vote otherwise. but support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue. a fair and credible audit — conducted expeditiously and completed well before january 20 — would dramatically improve americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president. we owe that to the people.
ap\n\nashburn, va. (ap) — will compton figured the washington redskins' defense wouldn't be a quick fix, and he was right.\n\nthe middle linebacker hoped for the best, but the unit ranked 28th in the nfl for the second straight year as its struggles contributed to what coach jay gruden called a barely above average 8-7-1 season. slow starts and inconsistent offense hurt washington down the stretch, but retooling the defense — again — is a top priority.\n\ncornerbacks josh norman and bashaud breeland and linebacker ryan kerrigan will be back, but the redskins could have a cast around them and possibly even a new coordinator if joe barry takes the fall for breakdowns and blunders that cost them a playoff berth.\n\nwe didn't do a great job of executing in certain areas of our defense, but we've just got to find a way to get better, whether it's coaching or new players, said defensive end chris baker, one of more than a dozen pending free agents. you can always get more talent, get more depth at each position.\n\nmore than just struggling against the run and pass, washington was worst in the league in third-down defense and among the worst teams in the red zone. whether that's scheme or personnel is a matter of debate but most likely a combination of the two.\n\nthe reason he's taking heat is because the people that don't execute his play, defensive end ricky jean francois said. it's going to make it seem like 'well he doesn't know what he's doing, he's not adjusting, he's not doing this.' sometimes he may not have done that, but the majority of times when he did do it, did we follow him? and when we didn't, now he's in the hot seat. now his job is on the line. so i really don't blame it fully on him.\n\ngruden said every player and coach would be evaluated and that barry's status would ultimately be his call. compton said he felt barry put players in the right position to succeed a majority of the time.\n\non the personnel side, the redskins could use a defensive lineman and a linebacker or two and have to figure out their safety situation. hybrid su'a cravens could be a boon to the defense as a strong safety in his second nfl season.\n\nsome other things the redskins need to resolve:\n\ncousins' contract status: the soap opera drama over quarterback kirk cousins' contract has been renewed for an encore after he played this season on the $19.95 million franchise tag. because of the uncertainty on each side about a long-term fit, the redskins' most likely course of action is tagging cousins again at a cost of $23.94 million and evaluating again.\n\nin his weekly radio appearance, cousins was noncommittal when asked about his desire to stay and didn't know if the team wanted to commit to him for the long haul.\n\nwe haven't been able to talk since july 15, so i don't know if they've bought the engagement ring, if you will, cousins said.\n\nwhat ya got, rook: a lost year for rookie receiver josh doctson because of achilles tendinitis means he could get thrown into a big role in his second season, despite just two catches in two games. the redskins could lose desean jackson and pierre garcon in free agency and don't know what they have in doctson, a first-round pick out of tcu.\n\nthat unknown could force general manager scot mccloughan to pay a premium to retain garcon or jackson.\n\njones' fumbled opportunity: matt jones was given the no. 1 running back job and fumbled it away, becoming inactive for the final nine games of the season as undrafted rookie robert kelley took over. one season isn't evidence that kelley can be a top-flight starter, but the redskins have to decide whether to keep the very affordable jones around to compete or cut ties.\n\nmatt, with what people call his issues with fumbles and everything, he'll get that fixed, said third-down back chris thompson, who showed his value as a change-of-pace runner, pass blocker and receiver. fumbles are going to happen a time or two. but it's all about how you respond to it.\n\nback to the vets: pending free agent tight end vernon davis would like to be back with him hometown team for another season, and fellow 33-year-old deangelo hall is willing to restructure his contract after tearing the acl in his right knee in week 3. center kory lichtensteiger is probably as good as gone, and defensive tackle kedric golston's return is a major question mark as he'll be 34 and anthony lanier and matt ioannidis could step up as second-year players.\n\nhall knows being back isn't a sure thing.\n\nif they come to the conclusion that, 'hey we don't want you or 'you're too injury-prone,' then it is what it is, he said. i'll sit back and try to figure out, hey, do i want to go somewhere else and play because i do feel like i can still play, i can still be great.\n\n___\n\nap pro football writer howard fendrich contributed.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/ap_nfl

(current nba rules require draftees to wait a year after high school graduation, but that could change as early as 2022.) for now, he and about a dozen other teenagers, seven of them division i prospects, comprise a roster that has played in michigan, texas and ohio against some of the top-ranked players in the country.\n\nno. 1-ranked senior chet holmgren and several of his minnesota high school state champion teammates beat ypsi in ann arbor on nov. 12 in the academy's first game. then duncanville (texas), which has one of the nation's best sophomores, ronald holland, topped ypsi on nov. 28 in texas. ypsi has since beaten ohio's isa and texas' legacy school of sport sciences, each of which feature multiple division i prospects.\n\nbronny james, son of lebron james, and amari bailey, a top-five junior guard, are next for ypsi on jan. 9. the game in fort worth, texas, against james' california basketball club will be televised on fs1.\n\njaden akins, the four-star prospect signed with michigan state for the class of 2021, started the season with ypsi prep but left in december. last week, akins announced he was joining another prep school, sunrise christian academy in kansas, to finish his senior year.\n\nthe formation of ypsi prep and its ability to play games elsewhere has prompted questions about how it started and how it works. elgin bates billed it as a way to give michigan's top talent the most elite competitions. here's what we know:\n\nis ypsi prep a school?\n\nno, and it doesn't market itself as one. elgin bates was not specific this summer about the organization, registered as an llc in july. he hasn't since publicly talked about the team, which had a game broadcast on espn2 and has its games streamed via a third-party subscription service.\n\nypsi prep is an academic-based basketball academy that provides its student-athletes an ncaa certified core curriculum while providing athletic and life skills training in preparation for college, bates said via email.\n\nbates, who played division ii basketball and professionally overseas, has trained his son and others on the team through the aau program bates fundamentals. the head coach for ypsi prep is corey tucker, who coached in ohio for more than 15 years, according to his linkedin resumé.\n\nwhen asked if ypsi receives taxpayer money, bates said it does not, and that team expenses are paid by a nonprofit foundation and local and regional sponsors.\n\nnike and gatorade, along with a host of small businesses, sponsor the team.\n\nypsi prep partners with a separate entity, arbor valley academy, to provide its education services and has no relationship with the michigan department of education. nor does ypsi have a relationship with the ncaa's eligibility center — the body that reviews each high school's or educational organization's courses for approval at the next level of athletics.\n\nwhat does mhsaa say about all this?\n\nnothing, really. ypsi prep plays outside of michigan high school athletics association sanctions.\n\nthat means ypsi prep is not subject to the travel restrictions of mhsaa member schools — but it also cannot compete for a state title. ypsi prep has yet to play a team from michigan, but has planned to play home games.\n\nemoni bates won an mhsaa title with his local public school, ypsilanti lincoln, as a freshman in 2019. among 10,000-plus schools with athletics, only a few dozen, mostly small parochial schools and homeschools, play outside of mhsaa rule.\n\nand none of them do it quite like ypsi prep.\n\nwill ypsi prep players qualify for division i competition?\n\nif they complete courses at an approved institution, yes, but ypsi alone doesn't provide that education. each player must meet ncaa's core standards and provide transcripts from an approved entity; public school, private school, charter school or otherwise.\n\nbut the ncaa isn't in the business of authorizing an educational institution, per se. it tries to verify the institution can provide the required courses that high school athletes need to qualify for initial eligibility under ncaa rules. then it can accept that student's transcripts.\n\nit's not an accreditation process, because the ncaa doesn't have authority over high schools, said tim nevius, an attorney who regularly spars with the organization on behalf of student-athletes. the ncaa is a college and university member association that sets rules that determine the eligibility of its players.\n\nthe ncaa's eligibility center assesses each high school or education organization's curriculum and can give it a variety of designations, with periodic reassessment to follow. arbor valley was approved for the first time in september.\n\nas a former ncaa employee, nevius is well-versed in investigating misconduct on behalf of the institution. now he has his own firm that represents players, but has no connection or knowledge of ypsi or arbor valley.\n\nhe said it's possible for a school or educational outlet to be cleared in a matter of months if their paperwork is right. as of now, it appears if students who play at ypsi pass courses at arbor valley academy, they would be eligible to play in college. they would have to meet the eligibility center's amateurism requirements as well.\n\ntyler davis can be contacted at tjdavis@freepress.com or on twitter @tdavisfreep.
washington – with president donald trump continuing to erroneously claim he won the election in the lead-up to jan. 6, several republican allies planned to fight the results when congress met to formally count the votes of the electoral college.\n\nbut the deadly pro-trump riot that took place that day forced a recess to the process, and some gop lawmakers backed down from their plans to object to president-elect joe biden's victory in some states.\n\nstates had already certified their electoral college results, and biden secured the election with 306 votes to trump's 232.\n\nin the next step of the certification process, the constitution requires both chambers of congress to meet before the inauguration to count the electoral votes from every state. the typically ceremonial event drew more attention this year when a group of republican lawmakers said they planned to contest the results.\n\nany objection to a state's results would require support from at least one house representative and one senator to be considered, and the two chambers would meet separately to debate and vote on any disputes.\n\nvice president mike pence officially declared biden the winner at 3:41 a.m. est on jan. 7, after lawmakers reconvened to complete the process following the violence at the capitol. votes to object to state results proceeded for only two states, arizona and pennsylvania, while others lacked the support needed to come to a vote. the efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nmore:trump officials who have resigned following riot at us capitol\n\nthese are the lawmakers who brought challenges to states' electoral college results or voted to overturn the election results, followed by those who backed down from their earlier stance.\n\nlawmakers who objected\n\nsen. tommy tuberville, alabama\n\ntuberville voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ntuberville, a freshman republican senator who was sworn into office jan. 3, first indicated in december that he might fight the vote.\n\nit's impossible. it is impossible what happened, tuberville, said referring to biden's victory. but we're going to get that corrected.\n\nyou'll see what's coming. you've been reading about in the house. we're going to have to do it in the senate, tuberville stated.\n\nmore:sen.-elect tommy tuberville suggests he might challenge electoral college count; other gop senators mum\n\non saturday, he announced his support for cruz's effort, saying he will vote to reject electors from disputed states until that commission has an opportunity to conduct its review, which i believe can and should happen before inauguration day.\n\nrep. mo brooks, alabama\n\nbrooks voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nbrooks led the effort in the house of representatives to reject biden's electoral college victory. the gop congressman said he wanted to reject the electoral votes certified by states such as georgia and pennsylvania that he claims had flawed election systems.\n\nthe congressman said dozens of members plan on challenging the results.\n\nrep. jerry carl, alabama\n\ncarl voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\ni have legitimate concerns about the integrity of our elections process, and there are serious questions my colleagues and i are seeking answers to, the freshman congressman said.\n\nhe continued, americans deserve the right to participate in free and fair elections, but many voters feel they were robbed of this opportunity in states where verified fraud and irregularities occurred on november 3rd. if given the opportunity to challenge electors from these states, i will certainly do so. president trump has had our backs, and now is the time for us to have his as he rightfully pursues challenges to election fraud.\n\nrep. mike rogers, alabama\n\nrogers voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nrogers said in a statement he will join other lawmakers in an effort to challenge the electoral college votes in key states.\n\nhe claimed the allegations of election fraud must be thoroughly investigated before congress can act. the results of a handful of states critical to both campaigns are in serious doubt. our elections should be free, fair and transparent. the 2020 election was not. therefore, i will object to the results of the electoral college.\n\nrep. barry moore, alabama\n\nmoore voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nmoore said on twitter that he would back brooks' challenge in congress.\n\nit's my honor to stand with @repmobrooks, he tweeted. we met in his office yesterday it's time to stand it's time we draw a line i. the sand and advance #electionintegrity ...it's the new #woke.\n\nrep. robert aderholt, alabama\n\naderholt voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\naderholt released a statement explaining his position on congress certifying the electoral process, saying that it is clear to me that congress has the final review of the electoral process and this is not just a ceremonial act.\n\ntherefore, based on the overwhelming questions that have been raised about moving forward with the approval of the electors from the states aderhold stated, saying he came to the conclusion that there are too many reports of serious fraud for this not to be debated in the house and senate.\n\nwe owe it to the american people to investigate what exactly transpired during this election year, and if state laws were broken by activist judges who decided to make election law on their own, he continued, also saying he supports cruz's efforts for a commission.\n\nrep. gary palmer, alabama\n\npalmer voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. andy biggs, arizona\n\nbiggs voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nbiggs, who chairs the conservative house freedom caucus, told fox business the group that met with trump discussed the process for objecting to electoral votes on jan. 6.\n\nwe think we're going to actually be able to contest this, as you say, with at least one objection from the house — and we'll have dozens of objectors in the house — and then at least one in the senate, and we think we'll have more than that, he said.\n\nrep. paul gosar, arizona\n\ngosar voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ngosar confirmed that he was among the earliest republicans to sign onto brooks' effort, hoping to prevent the house from certifying the results of the electoral college on jan. 6, the usa

voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ni do believe there is enough evidence of compromised processes and breakdowns in election integrity by certain state legislatures that do in fact warrant a closer examination, garcia said in a statement. we need a full forensic audit of several states to ensure all americans have confidence in our elections.\n\nrep. kevin mccarthy, california\n\nmccarthy voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nmccarthy, the house minority leader, expressed support ahead of congress meeting for his colleagues' efforts.\n\ni think it's right that we have the debate. i mean, you see now that senators are going to object, the house is going to object — how else do we have a way to change the election problems? mccarthy said.\n\nrep. ken calvert, california\n\ncalvert voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. darrell issa, california\n\nissa voted to support objections for both contested

states.\n\nseveral states removed voter safeguards during the 2020 elections that violated provisions in their respective state constitutions and the united states constitution, boebert said in a statement.\n\nshe continued, as a representative sworn to defend the u.s. constitution, it is my responsibility to object to the electoral college results that were recorded under these circumstances. the american people deserve secure and fair elections. unfortunately, the 2020 election was neither of those things.\n\nrep. doug lamborn, colorado\n\nlamborn voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nlamborn told colorado public radio, there were irregularities in ... some of these states.\n\nwhether it rises to the level of widespread fraud, i'd like to get to the bottom of that, and i don't have an answer for that, he continued.\n\nrep. matt gaetz, florida\n\ngaetz voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ngaetz, one of trump's most vocal supporters on capitol hill, tweeted he will join fellow gop lawmakers to object to electors from states that didn't run clean elections.\n\nrep. byron donalds, florida\n\ndonalds voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ndonalds wrote in a statement he will object to the certification to ask legitimate questions to restore faith in our election system.\n\nunlike my democratic colleagues, he continued, i refuse to turn a blind eye to the fact that several states, including the commonwealth of pennsylvania, neglected the oath of their constitution and the united states constitution to follow their election laws.\n\nrep. john rutherford, florida\n\nrutherford voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrutherford tweeted that he will object to electoral college results

civil litigation remains pending.\n\nrep. bill posey, florida\n\nposey voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nthere has not been a serious investigation by federal agencies into the growing body of evidence of election fraud, posey told usa today network paper tcpalm in a statement monday, and among the court cases dismissed, most were dismissed on technical grounds rather than review of evidence of fraud, thus i will object as the evidence must be examined.\n\nmore:reps. posey, mast ready to vote against certifying fair election, call for investigations\n\nrep. brian mast, florida\n\nmast voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nit's clear that congress only intends to act when it will hurt president trump, and i will not go along with this farce,  mast said in his statement. therefore, in the absence of a congressional investigation into fraud in the 2020 presidential election, i will oppose certifying the results.\n\nrep. scott franklin, florida\n\nfranklin voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nfranklin announced monday that he will join fellow republicans in challenging the results of the 2020 election on wednesday.\n\nfollowing the election, there has been a lack of transparency in counting votes in several states that merit closer scrutiny, franklin said in a statement. for that reason, i will join my republican colleagues in challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election to ensure that there is a fair election process that counts every legally casted vote.\n\nmore:lakeland rep. scott

were notified and, according to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, the signature audit performed in the state found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nafter weeks of researching georgia's

of georgia, laudermilk said, continuing that he will object.\n\nrep. rick allen, georgia\n\nallen voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. earl l. buddy carter, georgia\n\ncarter

by senator cruz and other members of the senate to immediately appoint an electoral commission to do a ten day audit of the votes cast would, if nothing else, help restore confidence in our elections moving forward, he continued.\n\nrep. richard hudson, north carolina\n\nhudson voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ni know there are many who will disagree with my decision to

perhaps, more misleading, daines spokesperson katie schottler told the missoula current. for all stories following today's news, if you are to include something like 'daines is to object to electoral

members of congress expect a long day of bitter debate wednesday as both houses convene at 1 p.m. to count electoral college votes and recognize democrat joe biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nthough the vote count is usually a short, ceremonial event, objections by republican allies of president donald trump – 13 senators and at least 100 house members – will force representatives to consider each objection and vote to accept or reject them. the contentious session could last late into the night.\n\nhouse republicans will object to results in six states contested by trump after the election: arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin. republican senators plan to target arizona, georgia and pennsylvania.\n\nstate officials have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, as trump claimed. usa today reported the president and republican allies filed 62 lawsuits seeking to overturn election results in states trump lost, according to marc elias, a democratic election lawyer who is tracking the results. sixty-one of those suits have been dismissed.\n\nbiden won the electoral college vote, 306 to 232. those numbers are unlikely to change in wednesday's count, since both houses of congress must agree to accept objections. democrats, who control the house of representatives, and republican leaders who are against the challenge will not vote to accept.\n\nthe congressional session is mandated by the constitution and follows the electoral count act of 1887. how objections are handled in the process:\n\njoint session\n\nsenate and house members meet in joint session in the house of representatives chamber.\n\nvice president mike pence, president of the senate, is the presiding officer.\n\ntrump tweeted that pence has the authority to reject fraudulently chosen electors. legal scholars say the constitution does not give pence that power.\n\nif pence can't preside, sen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, the senate pro tempore, or the longest-serving senator of the majority party, takes over.\n\nresults delivered\n\ntwo mahogany boxes containing sealed certificates of the electoral votes of each state and the district of columbia are brought in.\n\ncertificates opened\n\nthe presiding officer opens the certificates by state alphabetical order and gives them to four tellers, officers approved by senate and house members of both parties. each chamber appoints two tellers.\n\n'call for objections, if any'\n\nthe tellers read each certificate out loud and record and count votes. the presiding officer asks if there are any objections.\n\nany house or senate member can object to the vote for any reason. the presiding officer will not respond to the objection unless:\n\nit's in writing.\n\nit's signed by both a house and senate member.\n\nif the objection is a joint house/senate request, the joint session is suspended. the senate leaves the house chamber and both houses go into separate sessions to debate it.\n\nmembers who plan to issue objections for these states:\n\ndebate is limited to two hours. each member may speak only once, for up to five minutes.\n\nby simple majority, both chambers vote to accept or reject the objection. the house and senate return to the joint session and announce results. if:\n\nboth chambers reject: votes are counted\n\nvotes are counted one chamber accepts, the other rejects: votes are counted\n\nvotes are counted both chambers accept: votes are not counted\n\nthe joint session then repeats the process with the next state.\n\nwinner announced\n\nthe electoral votes are counted, and the candidate with at least 270 wins. the presiding officer announces winners for president and vice president.\n\nif neither candidate gets 270 votes – virtually impossible this time – the house would choose the president. each state casts one vote.\n\nelectoral objections were last raised in 2005, when rep. stephanie tubbs jones, d-ohio, and sen. barbara boxer, d-calif., claimed voting irregularities in ohio. their objections were rejected.\n\nthe joint session is the last legislative chance for objections to election results. lawsuits filed in court are still possible.\n\nsource usa today network reporting and research; congressional research service; constitutioncenter.org; associated press

stanislav djorgovski of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics told the associated press back in 1987. ″that's something very new and changes our conception of how galaxies form,″ djorgovski

battery by restraint, los angeles county district attorney jackie lacey announced today.\n\nwe believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them, lacey said in a statement, adding that she commended the victims who spoke out and bravely recounted what happened to them. it is my hope that all

ap\n\nfrankfurt, germany (ap) — germany's football president is against enlarging the world cup.\n\nreinhard grindel says in an interview published on the federation's website that fifa proposals to enlarge the tournament from 32 teams to 40 or 48 have considerable weaknesses that are also clearly shown in fifa factsheets.\n\ngrindel says, at the dfb, we're fundamentally convinced that the tried and tested model of 32 participating nations should be held. the world championships were always tournaments that inspired . why should that change?\n\nthe dfb president warns that the quality of the tournament could suffer in soccer's core markets if more participants are added, and that conflicts could emerge between national teams and clubs if we overburden the players.
maeve mcdermott\n\nusatoday\n\nbarely a week into 2017, the year's first celebrity feud has arrived.\n\na decade ago, chris brown and soulja boy were just two young rappers climbing the charts, soulja with his breakout hit crank dat and brown with with you and kiss kiss. ten years later, with a handful of celebrity feuds under each of their belts, the two singer/rappers are taking aim at one another.\n\nstarting with a string of social media insults, chris brown and soulja boy's war of the words inspired champion boxer floyd mayweather to organize a pay-per-view match against the two artists, supposedly scheduled for march.\n\nhere's how the feud devolved.\n\nsoulja likes karrueche's pic\n\nis anyone surprised that this started on instagram? according to a string of nsfw tweets, brown saw that soulja liked a post of his ex, karrueche tran, and called him with some fighting words.\n\nthe difference between me and chris is i shot a (expletive) before. and he hit a woman before. we not the same, he wrote in one inflammatory tweet.\n\nbreezy picks a fight\n\nsurprising no one, brown was serious about that fight. his boxer friend adrien broner posted a string of instagrams of brown challenging his opponent to a celebrity boxing match, claiming soulja is continuously calling him on facetime and asking broner to set up the gym.\n\nkarrueche and chris trade words\n\nnaturally, things devolved between karrueche and her rapper ex in dueling instagram posts, also nsfw.\n\ni been chillen...working...eating my veggies...hitting these squats and minding my own business and that's exactly how i want to keep it, she wrote in the since-deleted, very relatable text post.\n\nbrown was less forgiving in his all-caps missive against his ex, where he claimed he's responsible for her success and the reason she has friends, some of whom he slept with. nice.\n\nall the while, the two rappers continued posting nsfw clips and tweets threatening each other, with soulja bringing brown's daughter royalty into the mix. happy new year! royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than soulja boy already. i'd be mad too, he wrote in one post.\n\nsoulja gets robbed?\n\nwell, that took a turn. soulja offered to meet brown in compton for a street fight, and he made good on his word, going live on instagram from the streets with a group of guys surrounding him, challenging him to come fight.\n\nthings escalated when one of the group members pushed soulja, with another one picking up his phone. did he get robbed? was it staged? will this ever end?\n\nsoulja's mom and brown's lawyer get involved\n\nfast forward to wednesday, when soulja appeared to back down from his claims, posting a video apologizing for his erratic behavior and claiming he just received news his mom was in the hospital.\n\nif that wasn't enough of a wake-up call, brown's attorney, mark geragos, also got involved, threatening to file a lawsuit against soulja.\n\ni'm not sure who you are but please confirm to the world that you will accept the defamation lawsuit i will file against you, he wrote on twitter.\n\nfloyd mayweather enters the ring.\n\nnot so fast. soulja had a change of heart about his apology, calling on his friend mayweather to train him to challenge brown in the biggest fight of the century.\n\nmayweather and soulja both posted a flyer for the event.\n\nbrown is seemingly on board, sharing his own graphic of his photoshopped torso standing over his opponent in the ring.\n\nthe match may be for charity — but there's nothing charitable about this beef stretching two more months.
jesse ferguson\n\nopinion contributor\n\nthis year is the 30th anniversary of nbc's law & order, which brought the dun, dun noise to life as the soundtrack of justice for millions of people.\n\nin 2020, images and phrases associated with police procedures are no longer limited to television dramas; they're associated with the real live president of the united states. too often, though, this is not the way progressives talk about him.\n\ndonald trump got caught red handed. he used taxpayer-funded military aid to bribe a foreign government to help his reelection; it's an open-and-shut case. naturally, trump's republican political allies are very upset that he got caught. like a scooby-doo villain, they think he would have gotten away with it if not for that meddlesome whistleblower.\n\nbut the american people have watched a lot of law & order, and they understand what really happened here. they need only look at the latest round of smoking-gun emails, which confirms trump's role in the plot.\n\nmost americans get the picture\n\nthe coalition of progressive pollsters at navigator research found that by 22 percentage points (57 to 35%), more americans say trump has committed a crime as president — and the margin is an overwhelming 30 points for independents (55 to 25%). both numbers are higher than support for impeachment itself.\n\ndon't trust progressive pollsters? the latest fox news poll found that by 15 percentage points, more americans say trump has abused his power than not (53 to 38%), and that by 8 percentage points, more say he has committed bribery (45 to 37%).\n\nnotwithstanding their view on whether trump should be impeached, people know that what he did was wrong. the latest nbc news/wall street journal poll found that three-quarters of americans say trump has done something wrong. regardless of their views on impeachment or removal, people see the air of corruption and criminality around him.\n\nwhat a change. from the late 1960s through the 2016 election, republicans seemingly had a monopoly on the law-and-order narrative. for all the years i've worked in politics, republicans have been the party with strength on the rule of law, a fundamental moral value at the core of their brand. under trump, they've traded that strength away.\n\nin the same navigator research poll, more people say trump thinks he's above the law than not — a difference of 24 points (62 to 38%). americans now trust democrats in congress more than president trump on the rule of law by a margin of 12 points (46 to 34%). in 2016, trump promised to be the law-and-order president, but people now see a president who believes he's above the law.\n\nonce is enough:don't let 2020 become 2016. beat donald trump.\n\nbeltway pundits and prognosticators, myself included, have been obsessed with the political fallout from impeachment. will it fuel trump or foment opposition? will it strengthen the democrats' house majority or backfire against them? but the american people aren't voting on impeachment. by the time the election rolls around, it will be in the rearview mirror.\n\nafter all, the 1974 elections weren't a referendum on president richard nixon's impeachment. they were a referendum on his crime: watergate. likewise, what the people may vote on in 2020 is criminality and the rule of law. and if that happens, trump is in trouble.\n\nmake 2020 about trump's crimes\n\nto make this argument, we have to meet voters where they are in this debate. bottom line: if you're using language that never could have made it into an episode of law & order, you're doing it wrong. you're not using language that furthers our case or reaches people in this moment.\n\ndemocrats have to focus our argument on the repeated corrupt and criminal activities that trump and his allies have been caught engaging in. the point isn't that he's violating norms; it's that he's violating laws. don't just lament the way that trump ignores the separation of powers by not having witnesses testify. make it clear that he's gagging witnesses and refusing to answer questions himself.\n\nif you defend the legal process instead of making the point that he attacks and belittles the very law enforcement officials who caught him, you're leaving voters behind. if you find yourself explaining the lack of prosecution after the mueller report, hush money and individual 1 by citing the justice department's office of legal counsel guidance rather than explaining that trump essentially has immunity, you're falling into his trap.\n\nwhat joe biden really thinks:worse than even his policies, donald trump is destroying america's soul\n\npeople may not track every nuance of this debate, but they smell the foul stench. they know that if an average american citizen had done any one of a dozen things that trump has done, they'd be in jail.\n\nthe president shouldn't be above the law.\n\nthis is why this scandal is so deeply damaging to president trump. long after the debate around impeachment is over, the lasting stink will still surround him. a majority of the country believes he's a criminal. people no longer hear the soundtrack from the apprentice when they see him; they hear that dun, dun from a new series — law & order: djt\n\njesse ferguson, a national democratic strategist, was deputy national press secretary for hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, executive director of the democratic congressional campaign committee's independent expenditure program and communications director of the dccc. follow him on twitter: @jessefferguson
tom pelissero\n\nusa today sports\n\nhouston – an ambitious project that encompasses far more than a football stadium won over nfl owners, who voted to approve the rams' relocation to the los angeles area on tuesday.\n\ndallas cowboys owner jerry jones – a native of inglewood, calif., where the stadium is to open in 2019 on the site of the former hollywood park horse track – called rams owner stan kroenke's vision for bringing the team back to the city it abandoned 21 years ago absolutely the greatest plan ever conceived in sports, as far as how to put the show on.\n\nafter a two-decade absence from one of the nation's largest media markets, nfl commissioner roger goodell has said the league finally found the signature project that would fulfill its stated goal of a solution to succeed in l.a. for the long haul.\n\nit's more than just a stadium, goodell said. it's a project, an entertainment complex, that we believe will be responsive to the kind of things that we need to be successful with our fans in the los angeles market.\n\nrams moving back to los angeles with chargers given option to join\n\nthe enclosed, glass-roofed facility – expected to be built for upwards of $2 billion, all privately financed – is just part of the plan. there could be as much as $15 billion in developing what amounts to a city that has the nfl as a featured aspect of it, jones said.\n\nhouston texans owner bob mcnair, among others, noted there will be space for the league-owned nfl network on the premises and the ability for the stadium to be home to two teams, should the san diego chargers – who have first dibs – or oakland raiders choose to join the rams there after their competing project in nearby carson, calif., lost out.\n\nst. louis mayor francis slay all but told the nfl what they can do with their new stadium.\n\nthe nfl ignored the facts, the loyalty of st. louis fans, who supported the team through far more downs than ups, and the nfl ignored a strong market and viable plan for a new stadium, slay said in a statement. i am proud of our effort and what st. louis was able to accomplish in an extraordinarily short period of time. i thank everyone who worked so diligently on this project, especially the governor's task force.\n\ninglewood mayor: rams deal 'transformative moment' for one-time lakers home\n\nkroenke, in a statement, defended his decision.\n\nwhile there understandably has been emotionally charged commentary regarding our motives and intentions, the speculation is not true and unfounded, kroenke said. i am a missouri native named after two st. louis sports legends who i was fortunate enough to know on a personal level. this move isn't about whether i love st. louis or missouri. i do and always will. no matter what anyone says, that will never change.\n\nthe inglewood city council unanimously approved the rams' plan in february 2015. but it wasn't until tuesday's daylong session here the team's return to the market it abandoned under previous ownership after the 1994 season was finalized.\n\nearlier in the day, the league committee appointed to study the l.a. issue said it was backing the competing carson project. it was unbelievable, jones said. i've never been in meeting where that many people voted for what the committee didn't.\n\nthe option to join the rams in inglewood, as well as an additional $100 million in financial support if the chargers or raiders can find solutions in their existing markets, was the solution owners settled on to try to advance the process for those franchises as well.\n\nbut it was kroenke – the 68-year-old missouri billionaire whose purchase of the rams was approved in 2010 – standing at the podium tuesday as the man who won the race to l.a.\n\nwe look forward to returning to los angeles and building a world-class nfl entertainment district in inglewood, kroenke said in a statement.\n\nfollow tom pelissero on twitter @tompelissero.
ted slafsky\n\nopinion contributor\n\nhealth care affordability ranks first or second among issues voters want congress to tackle in 2019, according to numerous polls following the 2018 midterm elections. while democrats and republicans have very different opinions on hot button issues such as the affordable care act and medicare for all, they unite when it comes to anger over pharmaceutical costs.\n\npresident donald trump has a plan to cut prescription drug prices, democrats of all stripes have campaigned on tackling this. should we expect to see big changes this year? as a 25-year veteran of the drug-pricing battle on capitol hill, i'm skeptical anything ambitious will be coming. even so, there's new momentum for change. here are my predictions for action on drug pricing in the new 116th congress:\n\nrequire drug firms to list prices in tv ads\n\nin october, health and human services secretary alex azar unveiled a proposal to require pharma companies to publish a drug's list price in tv ads that blanket the airwaves. the drug industry has argued that the information could be misleading because patients often don't pay the list price. even after these concerns are shared with the american public, a new kaiser health poll finds that a majority still supports it although by smaller margins.\n\nthe administration now appears amenable to a plan floated by industry group phrma that would provide more context to what a patient might actually pay at the counter. assuming that the administration is able to overcome first amendment challenges, i give it an 80 percent chance of becoming reality.\n\nallow medicare to negotiate drug prices\n\non the campaign trail in 2016, trump embraced allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices for seniors. democrats have introduced a series of bills that would accomplish this goal and have vowed to make this a top priority. but while a remarkable 92 percent of americans support the idea and virtually every other country utilizes this approach, i highly doubt anything this ambitious will become reality any time soon.\n\nthe trump administration would like to move forward on a pilot program to tie pricing for certain costly medicare drugs to what other countries pay — which is often dramatically lower than what u.s. customers pay. but even before the regulation has been formally proposed, big pharma has launched an all-out assault. considering that doctors, hospitals and patient groups have also come out against it, i would give it a practically zero chance of moving forward.\n\nput restrictions on drug coverage\n\nthe trump administration has also proposed allowing medicare to restrict what drugs would be covered by health plans that negotiate prices on behalf of the 45 million seniors who participate in the medicare part d program. the tactic, commonly used in the private sector and in other countries, is to avoid the use of very expensive medications when there are cheaper versions that are therapeutically equivalent. despite the drug industry's impressive ability to kill measures like this, i would give it an 80 percent chance of becoming law in a watered-down form.\n\nlet people buy medicine from other countries\n\nevery new session of congress, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduces bills to allow americans to buy pharmaceuticals from canada. while the bill sponsors often change, the legislation always ends up in the proverbial trash heap. the drug industry and some medical professionals have raised concerns about counterfeit medicines ending up in the hands of patients.\n\ncould 2019 be different? the stars are aligned for action. food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb has formed a work group to explore the option of importing drugs in certain instances of price gouging. the work group's mandate is very limited, but no one expected that an agency overseen by a longtime advocate of the pharmaceutical industry would even consider this idea.\n\nsen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, a maverick and the new chairman of the senate finance committee, will be pushing for a more ambitious plan to allow importation from canada and will have plenty of support from congressional democrats. even the esteemed american medical association recently endorsed drug importation from canada. nonetheless, i give importation no more than a 25 percent chance. if it passes, it will be permissible only if patients travel north to get their medicine and pick it up in small quantities at licensed brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nweaken monopoly power\n\nunder the u.s. system, drug companies are granted patent protection and market exclusivity to produce new medicines that treat some of our most debilitating diseases. this is an important way to encourage innovation and risk-taking, but many academics and policymakers have pointed out that drug companies often abuse this monopoly power.\n\na whopping 78 percent of patents approved by the fda are for existing drugs rather than new ones. drug manufacturers, already entitled to up to 20 years of patent protection, need only make slight modifications to get additional protections. to make matters worse, many brand name manufacturers will pay a generic company to delay introduction of cheaper alternatives.\n\nled by grassley and sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., lawmakers have introduced several bills to spur competition. more than 100 house democrats have even proposed to strip a company's patent rights when it refuses to lower prices. but don't count on any type of patent legislation to become law in the 116th congress. a much better bet is the creates act, which would speed generic drugs to market by giving generic companies early access to samples for comparison tests. i give it a 95 percent chance of passage.\n\nis there anything that will definitely happen in 2019? in 2018, the drug industry spent a potentially record sum lobbying congress. there is a 100 percent guarantee they will surpass that milestone this year.\n\nted slafsky, founder and principal of wexford solutions, previously served as ceo of an advocacy organization focused on drug pricing. follow him on twitter: @tslafsky
should the 2020 golden globes have brought the notorious ricky gervais back as a host? did the right movies and tv shows win the awards? who made the best speech? usa today tv critic kelly lawler breaks down every winner, loser, presenter and gag at the 77th annual golden globe awards.\n\ngervais lost his shock and awe\n\nwas golden globes host ricky gervais even trying in his fifth time at the globes microphone? with a glass of beer on the lectern, gervais looked a little tired when he opened the show, reminding viewers he didn't care anymore (and never really did). he had a lackluster, lazy parade of jokes about baby yoda and joe pesci (the internet has beat him to much better jokes on the tiny alien), felicity huffman making license plates (the audience definitely wasn't with him there), cats, martin scorsese's height and movies about pedophiles.\n\nthere were a few chuckles to be had, but even fans of gervais' harsh brand of humor would likely be disappointed. there weren't many barbs to his supposedly sharp humor, merely a few weak jabs at apple and political celebrities. more than anything else, it was dull.\n\nmore:golden globes 2020: kate mckinnon nails what it feels like to see yourself represented onscreen\n\nbut as gervais said, they're just jokes, we're all gonna die soon, and there's no sequel. glad to know gervais is really done after this time.\n\nthe unsung winners\n\nhonestly, the best part of the awards from the hollywood foreign press association, the small organization that votes on the globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and tv shows that could use a boost. this year the lucky recipient was the great ramy youssef, the star and creator of hulu's ramy, who knew that this big room of hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. but they'd better now.\n\nanother underdog with a big win was the missing link, which edged out frozen 2 for the best animated film award. the film comes from laika studios, which was behind the incredibly animated coraline and kubo and the two strings. their films don't sell as many toys as elsa and anna, but they are beautiful to behold.\n\neyebrows, raised\n\nhave eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? stellan skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited tv series or movie for hbo's chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech. sure, he thanked the series' director, writer and usual suspects. but he also thanked the man who made the prosthetic eyebrows for his character. it was funnier than anything gervais said all night. hopefully it starts a trend. can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.\n\nmore:best dressed at the golden globes: taylor swift, nicole kidman and more stars stun\n\nmore:worst dressed at the golden globes: jennifer lopez, sofia vergara, cate blanchett, more\n\nbong joon-ho schools americans on subtitles\n\nthe director of one of the year's most acclaimed films, south korea's parasite, accepted the award for foreign language film with this biting missive: once you get over the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films. may we all heed his words of wisdom.\n\nkate mckinnon makes her case for next globes host\n\nellen degeneres won the globes' carol burnett award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by saturday night live star kate mckinnon's introduction. mckinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her degeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how degeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. she risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, mckinnon said. that mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. maybe mckinnon will step up next year.\n\ndj ansel?\n\npresenter ansel elgort didn't say much when he presented best original song to elton john and bernie taupin, but boy, did he sing! it was a little weird, but at least it was on pitch. perhaps some guerrilla marketing for his upcoming role in steven spielberg's west side story remake?

the first of the eagles' offseason moves began saturday when it was reported by the nfl network that defensive coordinator jim schwartz will not be returning.\n\nschwartz had run the eagles' defense ever since doug pederson became the head coach in jan. 2016. pederson had given schwartz full autonomy over the defense. schwartz, 54, will apparently take a year off and contemplate retirement.\n\nit was expected that the eagles will make some changes after going 4-10-1 heading into their regular-season finale sunday night against the washington football team.\n\nbut pederson, for one, expressed confidence this week that he will return for 2021. if that's the case, then it seemed likely that there would be changes on pederson's staff.\n\nschwartz, then, is the first change. schwartz would not discuss his performance this season when asked on tuesday, saying he's only thinking about the upcoming game against washington.\n\ni've got too much respect for the guys that are going to be on the field, some of which are playing for the first time, schwartz said. i've got too much respect for the game to talk about anything other than this game. i apologize for that, but that's where our focus is.\n\nthe eagles defense is ranked 21st overall in yards allowed per game at 371 and 22nd in points allowed per game at 26.5.\n\nthose are both the worst rankings in schwartz's five seasons with the eagles. but injuries have ravaged all three position groups on defense during the season.\n\nthat includes the secondary where an undrafted rookie free agent in michael jacquet started at cornerback last sunday against dallas, and was beaten frequently by cowboys receivers michael gallup and amari cooper.\n\nin the last two games, the eagles have allowed more than 500 yards in each game in losses to arizona and the cowboys.\n\nin addition, defensive tackle javon hargrave, the eagles' big free agent signing, had a slow start before playing well over the last several weeks.\n\npederson has often spoken highly of schwartz's work, most recently on friday.\n\nobviously, his defenses historically have been top defenses in the national football league – of course, when guys are healthy and all of that, pederson said. i think as the season progressed this year, i thought the defense actually was doing some really good things for us and keeping the offense in these football games here down the stretch – creating takeaways and sort of stymieing the run game from our opponents, things of that nature.\n\nthe players had also spoken highly of schwartz's coaching under difficult situations. the eagles have played most of the past month without starting defensive backs rodney mcleod and avonte maddox, both sidelined with knee injuries.\n\ni like jim schwartz. i love his defense, defensive end brandon graham said. i think sometimes because of injuries and certain things that happen, the defense that he runs, i feel like i'm always in position to make plays. sometimes, it's tough. we don't have the personnel to do certain things, like mcleod going down. that's our general in the back that keeps everything together.\n\nthere's a lot of stuff that played its part this year. it just sucks, because i know jim is a good coach and sometimes the way the season went, it gave people a bad name, for all of us. it was a bad name because we gave up 500 yards and it doesn't look good when you can't stop the bleeding.\n\nbefore coming to the eagles, schwartz had served as a defensive coordinator with the tennessee titans from 2001-08. during that time, the titans reached the super bowl and won the afc south three times.\n\nhe was the detroit lions' head coach from 2009-13, taking over a team that went 0-16 the season before he arrived, and taking them to the playoffs in his third season. he served as the buffalo bills defensive coordinator in 2014 before coming to the eagles.\n\ncontact martin frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com. follow on twitter @mfranknfl.
the last time marvin lewis and the cincinnati bengals made a major change on the defensive coaching staff, it was in january 2008, when he tapped longtime friend mike zimmer to come in to run his defense.\n\nthat partnership lasted six years, when zimmer left to become the head coach of the minnesota vikings. zimmer's thumbprint lasted until this week, when zimmer disciple paul guenther officially left to coordinate the defense in oakland.\n\nmore:paul guenther out as cincinnati bengals defensive coordinator, joins jon gruden and oakland raiders\n\nmore:ex-bengals oc zampese interviewing with browns, per report\n\nmore:bengals wr coach james urban bolts for baltimore\n\nwith a clean slate, lewis hopes that teryl austin can provide the same kind of boost that zimmer's reboot did when the bengals became a perennial top-eight defense in the league from 2009-13.\n\nthe enquirer has confirmed austin agreed to terms to become the team's dc early on monday and the club made it official later on monday.\n\nit's an honor to join the bengals organization, austin said in a statement released by the team. i look forward to leading an aggressive group of young men and helping them and the team achieve our goals.\n\nlewis said he liked austin's coaching mentality.\n\nhe is a bright and aggressive coach with a wealth of experience, lewis said in his team-issued statement. i look forward to working alongside him to take full advantage of our talented defensive personnel.\n\naustin, 52, doesn't have the long history coordinating that zimmer did but he comes off of four seasons in detroit where the lions went 36-28 overall with two playoff appearances.\n\nthe lions' defensive ranks those years were:\n\n2014: no. 2 overall, no. 3 in scoring\n\n2015: no. 18 overall, no. 23 in scoring\n\n2016: no. 18 overall, no. 13 in scoring\n\n2017: no. 27 overall, no. 21 in scoring\n\naustin also coordinated the 2010 university of florida defense under urban meyer, a team that went 8-5. bengals defensive back josh shaw was on that team.\n\nmore:report: teryl austin to interview for cincinnati bengals coordinator job\n\nmore:detroit lions block teryl austin from green bay packers interview\n\nmore:detroit lions interview dc teryl austin for head coach\n\naustin is a pennsylvania native and played collegiately at the university of pittsburgh. he also played in the world league in 1991. he began coaching at penn state in 1991 and eventually worked his way through wake forest, syracuse and michigan before mike holmgren and defensive coordinator ray rhodes hired him as the seattle seahawks' defensive backs coach in 2003.\n\naustin held that position through 2006 before taking the same position with ken wisenhunt and defensive coordinator clancy pendergast in arizona from 2007-09.\n\nmeyer gave him his first coordinator shot in 2010, but after meyer left florida for health reasons, austin was not retained by will muschamp. that sent austin to baltimore, where he was the secondary coach for john harbaugh and defensive coordinators chuck pagano (2011) and dean pees (2012-13).\n\nformer ravens offensive coordinator jim caldwell then took austin to detroit for the last four seasons.\n\nmore:mike brown-marvin lewis fact or fiction: are cincinnati bengals cheap with players?\n\nmore:mike brown-marvin lewis fact or fiction: cincinnati bengals lacking halftime adjustments?
ap\n\nmiami (ap) — the last miami play was designed by heat coach erik spoelstra to put the ball in josh richardson's hands, and with it came the right to decide who would take his team's biggest shot of the game.\n\nhe chose himself.\n\nit was the right call.\n\nrichardson's layup with 5.1 seconds left capped a miami rally from eight points down in the fourth, donovan mitchell missed a jumper for utah at the buzzer and the heat simply stole one in the final moments to beat the utah jazz 103-102 on sunday.\n\nhe drew it up for me and i was kind of surprised, richardson said.\n\nso surprised, in fact, that richardson emerged from that huddle telling wayne ellington and tyler johnson to get ready for his pass. but a lane opened to the rim, richardson laid the ball home and the heat won their fourth straight — all by single digits, miami's longest stretch of such wins since november 2012.\n\nutah played a very good basketball game, spoelstra said. in many ways, they deserved to win this one. but we've got to make up some ground. we've given up some games that we wish we could have had back, so quite frankly we need to steal some.\n\ntyler johnson and goran dragic each scored 16 points for miami. richardson and hassan whiteside each had 14, james johnson 13 and kelly olynyk had 12.\n\nmitchell scored 19 of his 27 points in the second half, but couldn't save utah from dropping its seventh straight on the road. he went into the backcourt to take the final inbounds pass and wound up taking a jumper from the right side that missed as time expired.\n\nmitchell kicked himself afterward, realizing too late rodney hood might have been open.\n\ni should have made the right read instead of shooting it, mitchell said.\n\nhood scored 17 points, thabo sefolosha added 13 and derrick favors 11 for the jazz, who fell to 3-17 on the road.\n\nwe obviously did a few things right, jazz coach quin snyder said. it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nmiami improved to 2-14 when trailing after three quarters.\n\nthe heat led for 20 of the 24 first-half minutes, but their lead was only 49-47 at the break.\n\nmitchell was 3 for 12 in the opening half, after going 5 for 14 against the heat when the teams met in november. it was like he was due to break out — and did just that, needing only 3 minutes to score utah's first 11 points of the second half.\n\nhe made his first five shots of the third, ended up 6-for-8 for 13 points in the quarter and utah took a 75-74 lead into the fourth. mitchell put the jazz up 93-85 with 6:28 left, but miami finished on a 18-9 spurt.\n\nfind a way at the end, spoelstra said.\n\ntip-ins\n\njazz: the 3:30 p.m. est tip is the earliest for utah this season. ... the jazz scored 74 points in the teams' first meeting this season; joe johnson's jumper with 1:09 left in the third gave utah 75 on sunday. ... utah is off until wednesday, which means the jazz — who had time for exactly one non-gameday practice in december — will get one during this trip.\n\nheat: miami plays seven of its next eight, and 11 of its next 14, on the road. ... there's been no change yet in the status of dion waiters, who sought a second opinion on his sprained left ankle last week. waiters missed his sixth consecutive game. ... the heat sent derrick walton jr. to sioux falls of the g league over the weekend, after he appeared in 12 games with miami.\n\nsilver watches\n\nnba commissioner adam silver watched the game from the stands. he's in miami for league marketing meetings scheduled for this week.\n\nboth sides\n\nwhiteside had tip-ins on consecutive possessions in the first quarter, 22 seconds apart, which sounds great — until realizing it happened on both ends of the floor. favors was credited with the basket when whiteside accidentally deflected the ball in for two utah points, and on the ensuing miami possession the heat center tipped in a miss by dragic.\n\nup next\n\njazz: visit washington on wednesday night, as their trip continues.\n\nheat: visit toronto on tuesday night, then visit indiana on wednesday.
ap\n\nwashington (ap) — just because all-star point guard john wall is out for the season, that doesn't mean the washington wizards think they're finished.\n\nbradley beal had 24 points, jeff green added 22 and thomas bryant scored 16 to go with a career-high 15 rebounds as washington beat the atlanta hawks 114-98 on wednesday night.\n\nwall, scheduled for surgery on his left heel jan. 8, hasn't played in any of the past three games but the wizards have won the last two.\n\nwe all have to be better, beal said. we know how much weight he carries, and his importance to this franchise and this team. we're definitely going to miss him. we hate that he's out. we're not sitting here saying we're a better team without him. ... we have to realize, accept the fact that he won't be with us this year and we've got to do our best to make a run at it.\n\ntomas satoransky had 14 points, seven assists and a career-best 11 rebounds for the wizards, who improved to 15-23. they've won consecutive games for the first time since taking three straight from dec. 1-5.\n\nsatoransky filled in for wall last season when he had surgery on his left knee and missed 41 games. as a result, satoransky doesn't feel the pressure he did a year ago.\n\ni maybe felt like that last year because it was an uncertain situation for me, he said. now, i know my role. people know me. they have confidence in me. that's how i feel on the court. i know what i can bring to the team. obviously, it's different than john, but you have to play smart.\n\natlanta was led by alex len, who a season-high 24 points and 11 rebounds. john collins scored 21.\n\nthe wizards took the lead midway through the first quarter. the hawks got close several times in the second half before finally tying it at 94 when len hit a jumper with 6:44 to play.\n\nwashington then went on a 17-2 run to build a 111-96 lead with 1:35 left.\n\nbeal, who was just 2 for 9 in the first half, quickly hit a basket and a 3-pointer. green followed with another 3 to put the wizards ahead 102-94 with 5:03 remaining.\n\ntip-ins\n\nhawks: c dewayne dedmon returned to the lineup after missing two games with left knee soreness. ... g kent bazemore was out for a second game with a sprained right ankle. ... atlanta coach lloyd pierce was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter.\n\nwizards: f markieff morris missed his third straight game with upper back/neck stiffness. he saw a specialist and the wizards were awaiting results. ... f otto porter returned to the lineup after missing 10 games with a bruised right knee. he didn't start for the first time this season and was restricted to 13 minutes. he scored nine points.\n\na different look\n\ncollins said atlanta changed its game plan with wall out for washington, but it didn't work.\n\njohn wall was going to be out and they move the ball, collins said. a lot of people tend to eat when he's out so we knew they were going to try and to come and have a balanced game and that's what they did tonight.\n\nmaking adjustments\n\nwizards coach scott brooks knows he needs to change up schemes without his star guard.\n\nwe're going to have to play this way, brooks said. we're going to have to scrap, put our hard hat on.\n\nup next\n\nhawks: visit the milwaukee bucks on friday in the finale of a three-game road trip.\n\nwizards: visit the miami heat on friday in the opener of a three-game trip.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nba: https://apnews.com/nba and https://twitter.com/ap_sports
from usa today network and wire reports\n\nalabama\n\nmontgomery: the state notched almost a third of its coronavirus cases in december, an alarming bulge that echoed the warnings of medical experts who said the state would see some dark days before the widespread availability of a vaccine to fight the pandemic. alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable covid-19 cases reported in december. the surge came after the thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in january from the fallout of christmas and new year's gatherings. we are being overwhelmed right now, state health officer scott harris said. i believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad. the cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases dec. 31. while there were some backlogged cases recorded in december, almost all of the reported cases were from december.\n\nalaska\n\nanchorage: health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies pfizer and moderna. that figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in december. thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in alaska. starting monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. that group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. almost 50 alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. that group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the daily news reports. alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last monday.\n\narizona\n\nphoenix: despite a surge of coronavirus cases, gov. doug ducey on saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman said in a twitter thread. hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the department of health services on saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known covid-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. however, ducey spokesman c.j. karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. this is a local decision. the online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\n\narkansas\n\nlittle rock: coronavirus hospitalizations in arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. there were 1,216 people in arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of covid-19 on saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. the arkansas department of health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of covid-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. those case counts are down from friday's record high, but gov. asa hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on new year's day. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.\n\ncalifornia\n\nlos angeles: hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the los angeles area began to receive help saturday when u.s. army corps of engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. the collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. some covid-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. california started the new year friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. the state department of public health on saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed covid-19 cases. more than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of saturday with covid-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. the southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural san joaquin valley to the mexico border. hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don't have any more beds for covid-19 patients. makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\n\ncolorado\n\ndenver: a day after gov. jared polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. the governor cited improving statewide covid-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including denver and the entire front range, but his announcement wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the denver post reports. it appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said mark johnson, executive director of jefferson county public health. the announcement came a day after colorado said it had confirmed the united states' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. we don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with christmas, new year's or the new variant that is more infectious, johnson said.\n\nconnecticut\n\nnew haven: some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. superintendent iline tracey announced on the district website thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting jan. 19. the new haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last march. officials in new haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in september as other districts in connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. a plan to reopen new haven's schools on nov. 9 was shelved amid rising covid-19 cases. tracey said schools will open jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. two schools, quinnipiac school and west rock school, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, tracey said.\n\ndelaware\n\nwilmington: after health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the covid-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. dr. karyl rattay, director of the delaware division of public health, announced the state's decision during gov. john carney's weekly coronavirus press briefing tuesday. front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, u.s. postal service workers and grocery store workers. the group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. but these people likely won't start getting the vaccine until mid- to late january due to the limited supply of the vaccine. please be patient with us. there's just not enough vaccine for everyone right now, rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. people who work in delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\n\ndistrict of columbia\n\nwashington: curators sam vong and shannon perich at the national museum of american history are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, wusa-tv reports. as historians, what we really want to do is document what's going on before it kind of escapes from us, vong said. the smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that americans' recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. all of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research, perich said. the submissions can be mundane. what did it mean to sit in your home by yourself? asked perich. the only way we're ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us. or they can be extraordinary, like one of vong's favorites so far from a former bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. the submission period opened in december and runs through march.\n\nflorida\n\nfort lauderdale: health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths saturday. florida's department of health did not release numbers on new year's day. the state has also chosen not to report covid-19 cases on two other holidays, thanksgiving and christmas. the two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed covid-19 cases in florida to 1,354,833. the agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported friday and 9,752 reported saturday. the state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. on new year's eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in covid-19 cases ever detected in florida, with 17,192 new cases. also on thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's healthyfla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in england has been detected in a martin county man with no recent travel history. martin county is north of palm beach county, which along with miami-dade and broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\n\ngeorgia\n\naugusta: as vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. gov. brian kemp and georgia department of public health commissioner dr. kathleen toomey announced wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to phase 1a – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. some augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. the richmond county sheriff's office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. dr. stephen goggans, the director of the east central health district, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\n\nhawaii\n\nhonolulu: residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the u.s., health officials said. the hawaii department of health, along with the centers for disease control and prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the honolulu star-advertiser reports. it has not been detected in hawaii. confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the united kingdom and south africa and in the u.s. in colorado, california and florida. all we know is that we have not yet found it, state laboratories division dr. edward desmond said. we're going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures. the vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. health officials have said about 25,000 covid-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in december to 65,250.\n\nidaho\n\nboise: gov. brad little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. the republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. the latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after november tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. for 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with covid-19 patients. among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. health and the economy are intertwined, little said. idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.\n\nillinois\n\nchicago: the state's public health department reported 29 covid-19-related deaths saturday, the smallest one-day total in illinois since mid-november. not only was the total, included in a news release from the illinois department of public health, lower than any single day since nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. the latest numbers bring the number of covid-19-related deaths in illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. the health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. but the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. the cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on new year's day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the chicago sun-times.\n\nindiana\n\nindianapolis: anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by covid-19 itself, jennifer sullivan, secretary of the state's family and social services administration, said during gov. eric holcomb's weekly briefing wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. that includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. as a way to help, sullivan encouraged hoosiers to use the state-run bewellindiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. since april, more than 25,000 hoosiers have completed those assessments. for more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, sullivan said.\n\niowa\n\ndes moines: a federal judge has rejected an argument by tyson foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. tyson was sued in august by the family of isidro fernandez, who worked at the company's plant in waterloo, after he died april 26 from complications of covid-19. more than 1,000 tyson workers tested positive for the virus in may, and at least six died. the families of fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. tyson fired seven managers in december after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. the fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at tyson's request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including president donald trump, when it remained open in april. but last monday, u.s. district judge linda reade rejected the argument.\n\nkansas\n\ntopeka: the state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in england, the director of the state department of health and environment said last week. no cases of the new strain have been detected in kansas. cases have been confirmed in colorado, florida and california. dr. lee norman said kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of covid-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. norman told reporters during a statehouse news conference that kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes covid-19, including a utah strain and a wisconsin strain. viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. mostly, they don't make much difference, norman said. they're more alike than different, quite honestly. the state on friday reported another 138 deaths from covid-19 since wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. kansas has confirmed 227,745 covid-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since wednesday, the health department said.\n\nkentucky\n\nlouisville: new coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. the previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes covid-19. kentucky ranked no. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a usa today network analysis of johns hopkins university data shows. testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. labs and testing sites closed. people traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in boyle, lawrence and clinton counties. adding the most new cases overall were jefferson county, with 2,743 cases; fayette county, with 1,170 cases; and kenton county, with 702. weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. the worst increases from the prior week's pace were in oldham, hardin and jefferson counties. the share of kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a usa today network analysis of covid tracking project data shows.\n\nlouisiana\n\nbaton rouge: with the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until monday and require a scheduled appointment. the louisiana department of health said friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. health department spokeswoman aly neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which neel described as a promising sign. with thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, gov. john bel edwards announced thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\n\nmaine\n\naugusta: protesters gathered outside the maine statehouse on saturday to criticize how democratic gov. janet mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. wabi-tv reports the protest organized by the swinging gate organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. there's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer dick campbell. more than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced sunday. one additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on dec. 19 to 528 on saturday.\n\nmaryland\n\nbaltimore: the maryland department of health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. the baltimore sun reports the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention are collaborating with the state's public health lab, as well as state laboratories in california and delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. there have been at least two cases of the covid-19 variant identified in the u.s., one in california and another in colorado. a maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in maryland. the cdc has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. but it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\n\nmassachusetts\n\nboston: gov. charlie baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. the republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in massachusetts to cover covid-19 testing and treatment. it also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of covid-19 on the health care system, among other steps. meanwhile, a covid-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at umass lowell last week instead will open monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. while the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. lowell general hospital currently has 63 covid-19 patients at its main campus.\n\nmichigan\n\ncalumet: a judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in michigan's upper peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. gov. gretchen whitmer's administration got a restraining order against cafe rosetta in calumet, a small town in houghton county. since november, bars and restaurants in michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. kristi painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. she ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. i did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … i observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled 'legal fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,'  painter said in a court filing. cafe co-owner amy heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can't afford to limit her business to carryout orders. she said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. it's my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family, she said. that's the right of every american. you can't make me not work.\n\nminnesota\n\nminneapolis: the state on saturday reported 54 deaths from covid-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. the new numbers bring the state's pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. a total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. the department of health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. in that period, the state reported one of the nation's lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to johns hopkins researchers. gov. tim walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for new year's celebrations. the attorney general has sued one such bar, alibi drinkery in lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a new year's party, the st. paul pioneer press reports.\n\nmississippi\n\ncolumbus: a hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. wcbi reports baptist memorial hospital - golden triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. johnny judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. i am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the alabama border, he told the station. i go up to north mississippi, south mississippi, and i go to these nursing schools, and i talk to these students. he said the country's nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. the bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. we put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don't lower the standards, he said.\n\nmissouri\n\njefferson city: the chairman of the missouri veterans commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since september. tim noonan told the st. louis post-dispatch on thursday that he was resigning, citing comments gov. mike parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. a summary of the investigation was released earlier in december, but noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the post-dispatch to release the full report. officials inside parson's administration and state sen. jill schupp, a democrat from creve coeur, had urged noonan to release the full report, and he did so after attorney general eric schmitt directed him to, noonan said. that came after parson on wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. i'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, parson said. i'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\n\nmontana\n\nbozeman: montana pbs has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in march to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. the new schedule for the learn at home broadcast was set to launch monday and continue through the end of the school year june 4, the bozeman daily chronicle reports. the shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. we know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a tv that receives our broadcast signal, montana pbs director of education nikki vradenburg said. chief operator paul heitt-rennie estimated most households have tuned into the learn at home program. he said nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going, vradenburg said.\n\nnebraska\n\nomaha: restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. the omaha world-herald reports the nebraska restaurant association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. the waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. this is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said zoe olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. the proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. but the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. when you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said chris wagner, executive director of project extra mile, an omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\n\nnevada\n\nlas vegas: community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state's diverse communities and reach out in spanish and other languages as nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. erika marquez, a university of nevada, las vegas public health professor and vice chair of the nevada minority health & equity coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. we had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time, marquez told the las vegas sun. nevada is a diverse state with a 29% latino population that includes native spanish speakers. nevada also has a fast-growing group of asian american and pacific islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than english at home, according to data shared by asian and pacific islander american vote. marquez's coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in english, spanish, vietnamese, korean, chinese and thai.\n\nnew hampshire\n\nconcord: the state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run covid-19 vaccination sites when it moves to phase 2. perry plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. he told wmur-tv the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. we expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we're ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the state of new hampshire as quickly as possible, plummer said. the first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. the second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. as of friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\n\nnew jersey\n\ntrenton: more than 70% of the state's supply of covid-19 vaccine had not been used as of thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. of the 265,000 doses of the pfizer and moderna vaccines that have been delivered to new jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by thursday afternoon. despite months of planning, state officials said wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. remember, you need health care workers to do this, gov. phil murphy said at a briefing. i'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. the slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 new jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. state health commissioner judy persichilli said the rollout of the moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before christmas. persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of pfizer doses had been administered as of wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that i've seen nationally.\n\nnew mexico\n\nalbuquerque: more than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. that's about half of the companies that applied, the albuquerque journal reports. the number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said marquita russel, ceo of the new mexico finance authority, the state agency that administered the program. the state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by new mexico lawmakers. the program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. about $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. in all, 6,530 applications were funded. russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nnew york\n\nnew york: the new york city sheriff's department shut down a series of illegal new year's eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced friday. more than 300 people gathered thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th street in queens, the department said on twitter. five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. deputies also raided an illegal gathering on prince street in soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. four people were charged with multiple offenses. the patrons were not wearing masks in the venue's overcrowded sixth floor. deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at stars hall in the sunset park section of brooklyn. the organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\n\nnorth carolina\n\nraleigh: covid-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. the news & observer of raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with covid-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. that's a difference of 793 people. on friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of covid-19 tests came back positive. that brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least april. the average is seen as giving a better indication of covid-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. every day since christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including thursday's record-high 15.5%.\n\nnorth dakota\n\nfort yates: the standing rock sioux tribe is prioritizing the distribution of covid-19 vaccines to those who speak dakota and lakota languages. standing rock tribal chairman mike faith told kxmb-tv the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. it's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. we don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. that's why it's so important, faith said. the standing rock reservation straddles the north dakota and south dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in north dakota. faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the fort yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. in addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. tribal health director margaret gates said the lakota and dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.\n\nohio\n\ncolumbus: as gov. mike dewine applies pressure to get covid-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. in some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. this is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. this is a whole different operation, said dr. andy thomas, chief clinical officer at ohio state university's wexner medical center. on wednesday, dewine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\n\noklahoma\n\noklahoma city: the state has reported more than 1,000 new covid-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said saturday. the oklahoma state department of health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. there were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in oklahoma on new year's day, according to the department. the state's record was set last monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in oklahoma hospitals. over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.\n\noregon\n\nportland: a health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the moderna covid-19 vaccine, according to the oregon health authority. the worker, an employee at wallowa memorial hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late thursday. the health authority said vaccines for covid-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. the centers for disease control and prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a covid-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or epipen, or if they must go to the hospital. health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the covid-19 vaccines.\n\npennsylvania\n\nphiladelphia: scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south philadelphia stomping grounds for a new year's celebration of mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd street in south philadelphia on friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. some wore masks, but many did not. mayor jim kenney announced in july that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. some mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. city spokeswoman lauren cox said there were no major issues friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. she urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\n\nrhode island\n\nprovidence: the first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot saturday. dr. christian arbelaez, an emergency room physician at rhode island hospital in providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the providence journal reports. the moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after christmas and new year's day. it's this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone? arbelaez said. do we have capacity? do we have front-line workers well enough? those are all the things that worry me. more than 20,500 people have received their first shots in rhode island, according to state health officials.\n\nsouth carolina\n\ncolumbia: nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. the state department of administration announced wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. the grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. the state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. the volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. that delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, frank knapp, president of the state's small business chamber of commerce, told the post and courier. the monies were allocated by the legislature in september to spend federal covid-19 aid for south carolina. the state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\nsouth dakota\n\nsioux falls: a federal judge says a state court can't use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a codington county trial. u.s. district judge charles b. kornmann also criticized south dakota's response to the pandemic, saying it has done little, if anything, to mitigate the spread of covid-19. kornmann ordered that unless the codington county state court resolves matthew kurtenbach's may 2019 case by jan. 15, kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. south dakota cannot 'take advantage' of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials, the judge wrote. kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. at one point, kornmann directly criticized gov. kristi noem's actions during the pandemic. the governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. she has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading, the judge wrote.\n\ntennessee\n\nmemphis: the shelby county health department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said saturday. the health department started vaccinating first responders with the moderna vaccine dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson joan carr. doug mcgowen, chief operating officer for the city of memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the shelby county community, and it's going to take a while to get all of those individuals vaccinated. some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. as of saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department's two drive-thru centers had been filled. the health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass covid-19 testing sites.\n\ntexas\n\ndallas: coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. texas reported 12,319 covid-19 patients in hospitals saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. but even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. intensive care units in several parts of texas were full or nearly full, with 626 icu beds available statewide saturday, according to the texas department of state health services. the department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of covid-19 and 487 probable cases. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in texas came back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.\n\nutah\n\nsalt lake city: less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of covid-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, deseret news reports. the initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said rich lakin, immunization program director with the utah department of health. we hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson tom hudachko said thursday. more than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. what's making the difference, hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. in davis county, a mass drive-thru clinic at the legacy events center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. at long-term care facilities, cvs and walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\n\nvermont\n\nstamford: the town has voted to overturn in its community gov. phil scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the covid-19 pandemic. the select board of the town of about 800 people along the massachusetts border voted 3-2 tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. the three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. select board member daniel potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. he asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. potvin said friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.\n\nvirginia\n\nrichmond: state sen. ben chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, senate republicans said friday. chafin represented southwest virginia and was from russell county. a republican, he was first elected to the house of delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state senate in 2014. he was 60. lawmakers from around the state mourned chafin's death late friday. i knew ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in moccasin valley, working the land just as generations of his family had

fine from the u.s. food and drug administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. owner randy kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in april. the family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the columbian reports. all distillers that made hand sanitizer during the covid-19 pandemic were facing the fine. the department of health & human services on thursday announced it was directing the fda not to enforce the fine after the fda received heavy backlash on social media. small businesses who stepped up to fight covid-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the department of health & human services said on twitter. kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. if the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. i'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.\n\nwest

of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the aurora medical center grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. a pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. on dec. 26, aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. after further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. on wednesday, aurora notified grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. the pharmacist was arrested thursday. the fbi and the u.s. food and drug administration were also investigating, police said. jeff bahr, president of aurora health care medical

for anyone, he said. we are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state's schools and businesses to continue to remain

words scaled by the frequency that president trump has used them in tweets during his term in office, according to the trump twitter archive.\n\nwashington — president donald trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass.\n\nbut just as he cried foul before a single vote was cast – something he also did in 2016 – trump has maintained he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief.\n\ndespite assurances from his own departments of justice and homeland security that no serious fraud occurred, trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse president-elect joe biden's 306-232 electoral college win.\n\nmore: congress' count of electoral college votes could be most contentious in 144 years. here are past dramatic moments\n\nthe president, his lawyers and his allies have filed scores of lawsuits; made repeated allegations of election fraud in news and social media; organized protests; tried to convince state legislatures to take action; and held hearings in various state houses, hotel ballrooms and, at one point, a landscaping company. and on wednesday, 13 senators and more than 100 republican lawmakers plan to object to the certification of biden's win when congress meets in a joint session.\n\nall those efforts to overturn the election can be a bit dizzying, so usa today has broken it down by the numbers to help make sense of it all.\n\nelection lawsuits: 62\n\nthe president and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results in states the president lost, according to marc elias, a democratic election lawyer who is tracking the outcomes.\n\nelection lawsuit defeats: 61\n\nout of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed, according to elias.\n\nsome cases were dismissed for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations. the decisions have came from both democratic-appointed and republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by trump.\n\nmore: 'it really is over now': the 24 hours that likely thwarted trump's effort to overturn the election\n\nstate supreme courts in arizona, nevada and arizona each rejected or declined to hear trump's appeals to overturn results in those states, while the pennsylvania and michigan supreme courts denied multiple lawsuits.\n\nthe 60th and 61st losses came in recent days.\n\nlast friday, a trump-appointed federal judge in texas dismissed a lawsuit from rep. louie gohmert, r-texas, that argued vice president mike pence has the conditional power to decide which states' electoral college votes to count.\n\nmore: a look at what several state supreme courts said about rejecting attempts to overturn biden's election win\n\non monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by voters in wisconsin, pennsylvania, georgia, michigan and arizona that argued state legislatures should have met after the election to certify votes.\n\nthe lone victory for the trump team was a small one. a pennsylvania judge sided with the trump campaign, ruling that voters could not go back and cure their ballots if they failed to provide proper identification three days after the election. the ruling affected few votes and did not change the outcome in pennsylvania, which biden won by 81,660 votes.\n\nnumber of contested states: 6\n\nthe vast majority of the lawsuits were in six pivotal battleground states that biden won: arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin.\n\ntrump won five of the states four years ago in his victory over hillary clinton, but biden flipped each to the democratic column.\n\nhouse republicans who plan to object to electoral college results wednesday said they plan to target these same six states.\n\nnumber of times the us supreme court sided against trump: 2\n\nthe u.s. supreme court twice refused to take up trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the nov. 3 election.\n\nin a one-sentence denial, the supreme court on dec. 8 rejected a request from pennsylvania republicans that sought to overturn biden's win in the state. the challenge, led rep. mike kelly, r-pa., claimed that the republican-led state legislature's expansion of absentee voting violated the state's constitution.\n\nthree days later, the supreme court refused to let texas challenge the election results in four battleground states critical to trump's defeat. the court said texas did not demonstrate a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.\n\nnumber of recounts: 3\n\ngeorgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming biden's win in the state. wisconsin had one recount that confirmed biden's victory there.\n\nthe first recount in georgia – a hand recount ordered by the state – found biden won by 12,284 votes, a narrower margin than the 14,196-vote lead he held immediately following the election. local election administrators identified uncounted ballots in four counties. each was the result of human error.\n\nthe second recount in georgia – one requested by the trump campaign – narrowed biden's victory to 11,779 votes\n\nvotes trump gained from recounts: 2,343\n\nin wisconsin, biden gained 74 votes following a partial recount of the state's results that focused only on two democratic strongholds, milwaukee and dane counties. it increased biden's statewide margin to 20,682 votes out of about 3 million cast.\n\nadding the differences in both states together, trump gained 2,343 votes as a result of the georgia and wisconsin recounts.\n\nnumber of elections trump has claimed were rigged: at least 6\n\nthis is not the first time trump has declared an election had been rigged or stolen.\n\non election day in 2012, when president barack obama defeated his republican challenger mitt romney, trump tweeted that there were reports of voting machines switching romney votes to obama.\n\npay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen, he said.\n\nfour years later, when sen. ted cruz, r-texas, defeated trump in the iowa caucuses, trump tweeted, ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!\n\nted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 3, 2016\n\ntrump also said the 2016 democratic primary was rigged against sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was rigged against him before it even took place. even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. a white house commission trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims.\n\ntrump went on to allege fraud in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately.\n\njust out — in arizona, signatures don't match. electoral corruption - call for a new election? we must protect our democracy! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 9, 2018\n\nthe president also declared in 2020, without evidence, that the democratic primary had once again been rigged against sanders.\n\nnumber of electoral votes changed as the result of trump's effort: 0\n\ndespite all the lawsuits, recounts and false voter fraud allegations, the electoral college on dec. 14 elected biden the next president by a margin of 306 to 232 – marking no change in the electoral outcome.\n\nbiden finished with a record 81,281,502 votes nationally, defeating trump in the popular vote by a sizable 7 million votes.\n\nwith 51.3% of the national popular vote, biden won with the highest share of the vote for a challenger of an incumbent president since franklin d. roosevelt in 1932. trump won 46.8% of the vote nationally.\n\ndays until biden's inauguration\n\nwednesday's joint session of congress will have procedural fireworks as 13 u.s. senators and more than 100 republican house members plan to object to electoral votes from potentially six battleground states that biden won.\n\nbut the efforts are doomed to fail, lacking the votes in the democratic-controlled house and even in the republican-led senate. because each objection could lead to hours of debate in the house and senate, the session could be a marathon.\n\nbut in the end, biden and harris will be inaugurated as the next president and vice president at noon on jan. 20.
ap\n\nnew york (ap) — the sales pitch from the jets to prospective head coaching candidates begins with sam darnold.\n\neverything else is a distant second.\n\nsure, being in the new york/new jersey area is an obvious attraction, and jets chairman and ceo christopher johnson spun his own take on a classic line by saying earlier this week that if you succeed in the big apple, you're a freaking legend.\n\nbut it's hard to even get close to that status without a franchise quarterback. a quick look through jets history is all it takes to prove that. it's broadway joe — and a 50-year wait for a super bowl return. and counting.\n\ndarnold, though, provides promise for frustrated fans that he might be the one. he's a 21-year-old, redheaded symbol of hope in a smart, athletic and still-developing quarterback who has his sights firmly set on being great.\n\nthat's what will excite coaching candidates and free agents the most, with the fact the jets and general manager mike maccagnan have about $100 million in salary cap space to play with this offseason and the no. 3 overall draft pick an added bonus.\n\nnow we're going to be able to build with sam, johnson said, build around sam and with some great players we have on this team already.\n\nthe jets' brass was in kansas city on wednesday to kick off the team's interviews, sitting down with chiefs offensive coordinator eric bieniemy. new york is also expected to schedule meetings with the likes of former green bay coach mike mccarthy, tampa bay offensive coordinator todd monken, dallas passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach kris richard, former detroit and indianapolis coach jim caldwell and usc offensive coordinator kliff kingsbury.\n\nwhoever is hired as todd bowles' replacement will report directly to johnson and not maccagnan, a structure the owner believes works. maccagnan will have a major say in the hire, though, working closely with johnson and vp of player development brian heimerdinger to find the coach who will attempt to end the team's eight-year postseason drought.\n\nand, with darnold leading the way.\n\nthe person doesn't have to be an offensive- or defensive-minded coach, per se, maccagnan said. but we definitely want to make sure they have a plan in place to develop our young quarterback in sam darnold.\n\ndarnold had an up-and-down rookie season after being drafted with the no. 3 overall pick. he was the second quarterback selected, two spots after baker mayfield went to cleveland — which is looking for a coach of its own and also has a potential face of the franchise as a major selling point.\n\nthe final stats for darnold are mediocre, at best: 2,865 yards, 57.7 percent completion rate, 17 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, 77.6 quarterback rating in 13 games. but, it's the way he finished that has the organization feeling so good.\n\nin the four games after returning from a foot injury that sidelined him for three contests, darnold was 80 of 125 (64 percent) for 931 yards and six touchdowns with one int. he showed clear improvement in his ability to see the field, read defenses, be smart with the football and wasn't as skittish behind an offensive line that struggled mightily early in the season.\n\ni thought in the beginning of the year, i took a while to get comfortable and then once i got comfortable in the offense and how things were, i felt very confident when i was out there, darnold said. again, just going to keep growing and keep trying to make those strides and watch the tape. see how i can get better and move forward from there.\n\ndarnold won't have a direct role in the decision-making process, but hoped to chat with management to share his perspective on the situation. and, the jets are planning to give him some preliminary face-time with the man who might be his coach.\n\ngiven the opportunity, i'd like the potential head coaches that come through here to have a chance to spend a little time with him just so they get a feel for sam, maccagnan said. i do think that's actually one of the attractive parts of our job is that we have some good, young players. again, we still have things we need to do and improve upon, but we have a lot of salary cap space. we have our draft picks and the idea of potentially working with a young quarterback like sam is an attractive thing.\n\ndarnold isn't concerned about the potential changes that coincide with the arrival of a new coach. he can adapt, he insisted, and simply wants to win.\n\ni'm confident that whatever offense is here and whoever the coordinator is, whether it's the head coach or an offensive coordinator, darnold said, i'm confident in my ability to be able to run an offense and lead that way.\n\nthe jets' final pick will be linked with darnold moving forward — and maybe for many years. the young quarterback would like this to be the last coaching change of his nfl career.\n\nyou always want someone to come in here and provide stability and hopefully we can win a lot of games together, darnold said. that's always the goal.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nfl: https://apnews.com/nfl and https://twitter.com/ap_nfl

of office during inauguration ceremony on june 6, 2019, at the orpheum theatre in phoenix, ariz. rob schumacher/the republic\n\nleer en español\n\nthe usa today network launched a series on the latino community in the u.s. called hecho en usa, or made in america. roughly 80% of all latinos living in the u.s. are american citizens. but media coverage of hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns. hecho en usa tells the stories of the nation's 59.9 million latinos – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are increasingly born in the united states.\n\nphoenix – inside a banquet hall at the corona ranch and rodeo grounds, tired couples and little girls with long braids dance to the easy sway of ranchera music.\n\nelection day has turned into a sweaty-hot may night in phoenix, and carlos garcia, the candidate everyone is here for, is waiting for the votes to be tallied. standing under a puffy mulberry tree, he's listening to campaign supporters swap stories and nursing his beer.\n\nthe historic race is still too close to call.\n\nif elected, garcia, a longtime human-rights activist, will become the first mexican immigrant to serve on the phoenix city council. he'll represent the fifth-largest and fastest-growing city in the nation. he'll lead a latino-majority district once known as the segregated part of town where latinos and black families in phoenix could own businesses and homes.\n\nas if to ease nerves, garcia directs the people crowded around him to a woman whose coal-black hair whispers against her shiny hoop earrings. she's holding a piggy bank the size of a mango. it's stamped: carlos for phoenix council district 8.\n\ntell them about the piggy bank, garcia says, nodding at jacinta gonzalez.\n\nin 2016, garcia, gonzalez and other protesters set out to block a road leading to a donald trump campaign rally outside phoenix. gonzalez was arrested – by deputies of then-sheriff joe arpaio, famous for being known as america's toughest sheriff and for being held in criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge's order to stop racially profiling latinos.\n\nafter deputies questioned gonzalez about her citizenship, she sued and won a settlement. and she turned that money into something garcia desperately needed, the thing many rising latino candidates lack: campaign funding.\n\nwe don't have access to big donors, we don't have access to corporations that are going to invest in his type of leadership, so we have to find other ways to support, she says. and so sometimes that's litigation, sometimes that's fundraisers, sometimes that's car washes. we do whatever we're able to do, because we need hope and we need the belief that we can actually do things differently. and we can change the culture of how people get to office and what people do when they're there.\n\njacinta gonzalez locks her neck to a vehicle blocking the principal route of a rally for president donald trump in phoenix. lucy sandoval/puente arizona.\n\ndespite the nation's ballooning hispanic population, latinos running and winning political offices across the u.s. are too often an anomaly. even in hispanic-majority districts, latinos don't run or win elections at the rates of their white counterparts, various studies show. now, candidates such as garcia – and his supporters – are looking to change that.\n\nnationally, there are an estimated 58.9 million latinos, making up about 18.1% of the u.s. population and accounting for the nation's second-largest ethnic group, after whites. yet only about 6,700 elected officials are latino, according to a 2018 analysis by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials, or naleo. that amounts to a political representation rate of 1.2% in local, state and federal elected offices.\n\nwhen garcia made his campaign public, most people didn't expect him to win, and not just because of his anti-establishment background. statistics are stacked against outsider latino candidates as much as they are traditional ones.\n\nbut ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, latinos across the u.s. have rallied against policies and rhetoric they feel target their community and are working to build momentum. political activists are recruiting latinx candidates to run in local and federal contests and aiming to win.\n\nlatinos will need more than passion to reach political equity, said angela ocampo, a university of michigan political science professor. indeed, if latinos continue to be elected at the same rate as they have in recent years, it will likely be more than 50 years before parity is reached, she said.\n\nit's going to take a very long time, ocampo said. it's even worse when we look at gender, at latina representation.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., listens as facebook ceo mark zuckerberg testifies before the house financial services committee in october. jack gruber, usa today\n\nmore latinos running for political office\n\nin recent months, latinos have been courted to run for congressional seats in texas, colorado and new mexico. at the local level, regina romero was elected in early november as the first female mayor of tucson, arizona's second-largest city, making her the only latina mayor in the 50 largest cities in the u.s. in 2018, democrat michelle luján grisham, a 12th-generation new mexican, was elected as the first latina democratic governor of new mexico. she replaced susana martinez, a latina republican.\n\nsome political analysts are calling it the trump effect, a backlash against political rhetoric and measures they believe harm latinos, migrants and people of color. ahead of 2020 white house and congressional races, that phenomenon could favor democrats, who historically garner more support from latino voters.\n\nbut for decades, latino candidates like democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york or garcia have received sparse support from mainstream political machines.\n\nlike garcia, ocasio-cortez, a self-identified democratic socialist, built her campaign around community support that few establishment politicos saw coming. the 29-year-old, born in the bronx, was working in a bar to support her family before she was elected in 2018, becoming the youngest woman in congress.\n\nocasio-cortez's ethnicity stands out. there were only four latino u.s. senators and 34 u.s. representatives as of january 2018, according to naleo. that number increased slightly after the 2018 election when voters sent four additional latino members to the house and made the 116th congress the most representative of latinos in history. still, that's just a fraction of the nation's 100 senators and 435 representatives.\n\nanalysts point to varied reasons for the disparity, including policies that suppress the latino vote and political funding systems that benefit candidates perceived as viable winners, which in many cases are white people picked by top republican and democratic party leaders.\n\nthese parties and their donors, they're very influential, but in many cases, latinos are receiving limited support from the important actors as they're trying to launch their campaign, ocampo said.\n\nocampo analyzed congressional races in latino-majority districts. she found that even with the majority-minority advantage, electoral success falters. for example, latinos are the largest ethnic group in california (40%) but make up only 24% of the california legislature, according to a 2018 ocampo study.\n\nand in new york, where latinos make up about 19% of the population, there are only 20 latino state legislators, accounting for about 9% of all new york state lawmakers.\n\nthe outlook for latina lawmakers is especially bleak, ocampo said. of the 6,749 elected latino office-holders across local, state and federal levels, only 2,485 were women.\n\nthe highest rate of parity by latino political representation is in florida and new mexico. new mexico has the nation's highest percentage of the latino population at 48.8%. in florida, the state with the sixth-largest latino population, latinos represent 26.1% of the population, according to 2018 u.s. census data. but the state's estimated 4.8 million latinos in florida have benefited from decades of political activism in cuban, puerto rican, venezuelan and other hispanic communities largely in miami that has resulted in an unusual number of hispanic lawmakers holding local and statewide offices.\n\ndata shows that when candidates of color run, their races draw more voters of color to elections, and those voters are more likely to vote for a candidate from their own racial or ethnic background, said matt barreto, a university of california, los angeles, professor of political science and chicana/o studies and co-founder of latino decisions, a political research firm.\n\nu.s. rep.

being recruited, they are not being sought out by the democratic party or the republican party, he said.\n\nthe latino vote isn't monolithic, but the growing demographic can wield power in competitive races won by the margins.\n\nmark lopez, a pew demographer, noted that while latinos tend to vote at a higher rate for democratic candidates, there's a significant conservative latino voting bloc. he points to the 2004 election when former president george bush captured an estimated 45% of the latino vote. roughly 29% of latinos voted for trump in 2016 after he launched his campaign by calling mexicans rapists.\n\nin the closely watched texas senate race in 2018, ted cruz won over beto o'rourke. cruz, the incumbent, repeatedly pointed out to voters that he was the son of a cuban immigrant and that o'rourke was not hispanic. cruz ultimately captured 50.9% of the vote in the tightest u.s. senate race in texas since 1978. o'rourke, who also targeted his campaign to appeal to latinos, captured 64% of the hispanic vote.\n\nu.s. sen. marco rubio of florida speaks during the 75th general assembly of the inter american press association (iapa), in coral gables, florida, oct. 6, 2019.

chairs the congressional hispanic caucus, it's simple: either you have a voice on issues that affect you, your family and your community, or others make those decisions for you.\n\nby next year, hispanics are expected to become the largest ethnic minority voting group to be eligible to vote in a presidential election, according to a study of the 2020 electorate released earlier this year by the pew research center. in all, 32 million latinos will be eligible to vote compared with 30 million voters who are black. it would mark the first federal election where hispanic voters outnumber black voters.\n\ncastro said latinos have made great strides since the civil rights era in the 1960s, when latinos battling discrimination formed the chicano movement to fight for the rights of mexican americans.\n\nit was a community that was marginalized, and in some places, repressed, he said. when my grandmother came to texas, there were signs that said, no dogs, mexicans or negroes allowed.\n\n​former democratic presidential candidate and former hud secretary julián castro speaks at the liberty and justice celebration at the wells fargo arena on nov. 01, 2019, in des moines, iowa. scott olson, getty images\n\ncastro and his brother, former presidential candidate julián castro, grew up in san antonio, a city where latino politicians run and win. their mother, rosie castro, was a chicana activist who in the 1970s joined la raza unida, a third-political party seeking to engage latinos in politics.\n\ncastro said he and his brother entered politics because they grew up watching latinos raise their voices as activists and successfully run for office. in 1992, san antonio-born henry bonilla was the first hispanic republican from texas elected to congress. and in 1981, henry cisneros became one of the first latino mayors in the u.s. when he was elected by san antonio voters. san antonio had not had a latino mayor since the 1800s, before texas became a state. later, cisneros was appointed by former president bill clinton as u.s. secretary of housing and urban development.\n\nhenry cisneros inspired a lot of young people, i think you see that often times, when there's a first in the community who runs for something, castro said. the turnout rate for the hispanic community was astronomical during cisneros' election.\n\ncastro's brother, julián castro, was the only latino in the 2020 presidential race before he dropped out last week.\n\ni think for a community that for many years had been marginalized and left out of politics, to now see someone from the community running for the highest office in the nation is important, joaquin castro said in an interview before his brother exited the campaign.\n\njulián castro has always embraced his mexican immigrant roots. he followed in cisneros' footsteps to become mayor of san antonio in 2009. but a recent poll by telemundo noticias showed he lagged in latino voter support compared with other democratic presidential hopefuls. the november poll showed castro in a three-way tie for fourth place among latino voters, with only 2% support, while joe biden and bernie sanders are leading the candidates among those voters, with 26% and 18%, respectively.\n\nshow caption hide caption latino voters carry signs that read unite the vote as they are serenaded by mariachis on their way to their

needed more latino voices, said barreto, of ucla. that issue was so consequential at the time. it was a bill that was going to affect the lives of more than 10 million undocumented immigrants, many of them latino.\n\nsome political analysts say the lingering effects of failed action helped spur today's hardline immigration policies and public divide over nationalism and migrant's rights.\n\nbut barreto said lagging representation goes deeper than immigration issues.\n\nevery bill matters, he said. there's a latino angle to education reform, economic policies, health care.\n\nthese aren't white issues, these are everyone's issues, he added. black, latino, asian communities, we should all be equally represented. that's what we should expect in a healthy democracy.\n\nand the latino vote is only poised to become more influential. latinos represent the greatest number of americans under 18, at 18.3 million, according to a 2018 pew report.\n\ngrassroots groups and larger ones like the latino vote project have launched massive voter-registration drives in recent election cycles. latino voter turnout in 2018, at 40%, reached a record high, increasing from 6.8 million in 2014 to 11.7 million. that's the second-largest turnout among latinos of any election year, presidential or midterm.\n\nlopez, the pew researcher, said latinos may be motivated to protect their rights and place in the u.s. about half of latinos surveyed said their standing in the nation had worsened in 2018, compared with 32% who said the same in the weeks after trump won the 2016 presidential election, according to a pew report.\n\nan estimated 55% of latinos said they were worried that a family member or friend could be deported, and two-thirds said the trump administration's policies had been harmful to latinos. that's up from similar feelings about barack obama, at 15% in 2010, and george w. bush, at 41% in 2007.\n\nmany experienced some kind of discrimination event, like being told not to speak spanish, lopez said. their lives have changed in a somewhat negative way in the last few years, primarily, since the election of donald trump.\n\ncouncilman carlos garcia (right) makes a point as the phoenix city council conducts a meeting at the orpheum theatre in downtown phoenix, july 2, 2019. councilman sal dicicio listens (left). tom tingle/the republic\n\nfrom protesting the government to running for elected office\n\nin many ways, garcia had already taken his place in history long before election night in arizona.\n\nyears before his election day party, while attorneys for arizona and civil rights groups were battling over senate bill 1070 – the state's notorious show me your papers law – garcia and other protesters stood outside the phoenix courthouse under the brutal july sun blocking the intersection. when police officers moved in to make arrests, garcia was in the middle, wearing a white t-shirt with the words we will not comply.\n\nafter trump was elected, he traveled to arizona in 2017 for a speech in downtown phoenix. garcia joined hundreds of people protesting the president's visit in the wake of a rally in charlottesville, virginia, that turned deadly when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of demonstrators. the mostly peaceful protest outside the phoenix convention center turned chaotic when police used tear gas and stun grenades on the crowd.\n\nhundreds of people later attended a phoenix city council meeting demanding officials hold police accountable. by then, trump had pardoned arpaio for the contempt conviction, further roiling many in the crowd.\n\nthe phoenix law enforcement association wrote a facebook post on candidate carlos garcia. via facebook\n\ngarcia stood before officials in a blue t-shirt that read not one more deportation. he told council members the community would hold them accountable.\n\nto think that we spent three-quarters of a million dollars for this person, this president, to come spew hatred and bigotry, to come spit in our face and pardon the sheriff who was convicted, garcia said. the city paid for a campaign rally. we have an opportunity to ... do this and to stand up for not only phoenix but cities across the country.\n\ntwo years later, the mexican immigrant's face was plastered on campaign ads across south phoenix where garcia lives in a community with deep latino roots. in the photo, garcia wore a familiar cornflower blue traditional mexican guayabera shirt, his baby girl on his shoulders and his wife, a teacher, and his son standing in front of him.\n\nnew

of a saguaro-studded mountain.\n\ngonzalez and her piggy bank the size of a mango still have the floor. earlier in the evening, garcia called her onstage, named her the campaign's no. 1 donor and gave her the memento.\n\ncarlos has been on the front lines – organizing, fighting against sb 1070, fighting against joe arpaio, she says, her eyes filling with tears. it's actually been a great joy of mine to be able to use the same money that came from arpaio, the same money that came from the state's incarceration system, to actually support his run for city council.\n\nlike this story? subscribe to support journalism like this every day.\n\nas the desert night fades, danny ortega, a phoenix attorney who has fought for civil rights since the chicano movement, leans against a wood-carved bar watching garcia mingle with campaign supporters. ortega says young and old latinos backed garcia because they saw a candidate who looked like them, cared about them and sacrificed for them.\n\nfor too long, we lost our way, ortega says, standing with his longtime friend alfredo gutierrez, who served for 14 years in the arizona legislature and has protested with garcia. too many latinos thought they had to act white to win. now, they're seeing the power in our own identity.\n\ngarcia moves closer to a grove of old trees, where it's quiet. he says it's justice that money won from a lawman who targeted his family and community, would help him overcome the campaign financing barrier most latinos face when they run for office.\n\ni've had six people in my family that have been deported, i grew up undocumented. and i hold that truth, he says, shaking his head. i grew up working class. i'm a single child of a single parent. and with my mom's strength, that she was able to raise me, that she was able to succeed in this country and make sure that i got through school, went to college, i've been able to help my community for the last 16 years.\n\nby the night's final vote tally, garcia holds a slim two-point margin. as his supporters leave the plaza, no one knows if garcia's lead will hold.\n\nin the morning, the final election results are in. garcia is at home with his family. with six words on his facebook page, he says what everyone who supported the outsider latino candidate – despite the odds – is waiting to hear: we got it! thank you all!\n\nhe wins the race with 51.47% of the vote. by 384 votes, garcia, and the community who voted for him, has made history.\n\nhelp support quality journalism like this. subscribe! get news and insights sent to your inbox. sign up for

matthew frankel\n\nthe motley fool\n\nyou haven't even filed your 2016 tax return yet, so it may seem a bit early to think about your 2017 taxes. however, smart tax planning is a year-round activity – not just something you do when you prepare your return. in that spirit, here are five things you could do in 2017 that could reduce your taxes and boost your refund.\n\nget a change of scenery\n\nif you've been toying with the idea of moving to a different area of the country, it may interest you to know that moving expenses are tax deductible if the move is related to the start of a new job.\n\nyou don't even need to have a new job lined up before you move. for your expenses to qualify, the move needs to pass two tests:\n\ntime test: you must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. in other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break.\n\nyou must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. in other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break. distance test: according to the irs' wording, your new workplace must be at least 50 miles farther from your old home than your old job location was from your old home. if you had no previous workplace, your new job location must be at least 50 miles from your old home. while this is a bit technical, the point is that your move needs to be sufficiently far away from your old job location to justify the tax break.\n\nif these two tests are satisfied, you can deduct expenses such as driving mileage, packing supplies, shipping costs, hired movers, storage expenses, and lodging expenses on the way to your new home.\n\nthe best part of all is that the moving expenses deduction is an above-the-line deduction, which means that you can take it whether or not you itemize deductions on your tax return.\n\nirs: here's when you can begin filing your 2016 taxes\n\ntake a class\n\nit's well-known that college students may qualify for a tax credit for paying tuition, known as the american opportunity credit. however, this is only good for the first four years of college, and only if a degree or certificate is being pursued.\n\non the other hand, the lesser-known lifetime learning credit doesn't have these restrictions. the credit is worth 20% of up to $10,000 worth of educational expenses, and there is no degree program, credit hour or other requirement. you can take a single class for personal enrichment or to obtain career skills and qualify for this credit. if you take a class that costs $1,000, this credit can give you $200 of that amount back.\n\nthe biggest restriction on the lifetime learning credit is income-related. for the 2017 tax year, the credit phases out for incomes above $55,000 (singles) and $110,000 (married filing jointly), and disappears completely above incomes of $65,000 and $130,000, respectively.\n\nbuy a house\n\nif you have been on the fence about buying a house, the tax benefits could be the motivation you need to finally get into a home of your own.\n\nthere are several lucrative tax breaks available for homeowners, including:\n\nthese trends could affect your money in 2017\n\n1. mortgage interest: you can deduct the interest on up to $1 million worth of mortgages on a first or second home. this is the big one -- if you have a $300,000 mortgage at 4% interest, this deduction can be well over $10,000 per year for the first few years of your mortgage.\n\n2. mortgage insurance: if you have to pay mortgage insurance, which typically happens if you put less than 20% down on your home, this may be tax-deductible as well, subject to income limitations.\n\n3. points: if you paid discount points to get a better interest rate, these are deductible as well.\n\n4. property taxes: the property taxes you pay on your primary residence are deductible. in high-tax states, like new jersey for example, this can be an especially nice tax break.\n\n5. capital gains exclusion: when you eventually sell your home, you can make up to $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) in profit before you have to pay income taxes on your gains.\n\nhere's a more detailed discussion of how buying a home can save you money on your taxes.\n\nbe generous when charities need it most\n\naccording to wallethub, 20% of all charitable donations occur during the last 48 hours of the year. and it would be fair to assume that many more donations happen in the weeks before the end of the year when everyone is in the giving spirit.\n\nthe point is that charitable organizations need money all year round, not just at the end of the year. for 2017, consider giving to charity steadily throughout the year. for example, if you donate to your local animal shelter like i do, consider handing them a donation check in, say, may. of course, they'll appreciate your donations whenever they come, but it could be an especially welcome gift if it comes at a time of limited cash flow.\n\nalso, wouldn't it be easier on your wallet to donate periodically throughout the year, as opposed to trying to cram your donations in at the last minute?\n\nthe skinny about freelance money: how to get comfortable with income, taxes and expenses\n\nhere's a thorough discussion on the rules and documentation requirements for charitable donations to make sure you get to deduct every dollar you donate.\n\nthe best tax break of all\n\nof all the available tax breaks, i tend to look at retirement-related tax breaks as the best of all. as i've written before, not only can saving for retirement boost your tax refund, but it can also help set you up for financial freedom later in life.\n\nif you contribute to a tax-deferred type of retirement account, such as a traditional ira or through a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plan, your contributions may be tax-deductible. think of it this way – if you contribute $5,000 to a traditional ira and you're in the 25% tax bracket, we're talking about $1,250 in tax savings.\n\non top of this deduction, low- to moderate-income taxpayers may qualify for the saver's credit, which is literally free money just for contributing to a retirement account. this tax credit can be worth up to $1,000 for singles or $2,000 for couples, so it's worth looking into.\n\nthe best part is that you'll be doing your future self a favor. let's say that you contribute the $5,500 maximum to a traditional ira every year for 30 years. you'll end up contributing a total of $165,000, and will most likely save tens of thousands of dollars on your taxes along the way. based on the stock market's historical returns, your account could swell to more than $800,000 in those three decades -- quite a nest egg.\n\ntax-smart strategies for retirement savings\n\nby saving for retirement, you can get a nice tax break now and a retirement nest egg for later. that's why i say it's the best tax break of all.\n\ntry any of our foolish newsletter services free for 30 days. we fools may not all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that

editors\n\nusa today\n\ndemocrats take the house as new congress convenes\n\nthe 116th congress will convene thursday, including a new democratic majority in the house after female candidates spearheaded gains for the party during the 2018 midterms. the presumptive incoming house speaker, nancy pelosi, told usa today in an exclusive interview that president donald trump can expect a different world from his first two years in office. she and her democratic colleagues plan to confront trump on such issues as the deaths of migrant children and the protection of special counsel robert mueller's russia probe. and they will have subpoena power, giving them new leverage in the clashes.\n\ngovernment shutdown: fight for funding takes a new turn\n\nshortly after nancy pelosi returns as house speaker and democrats reclaim the house majority thursday, they will put their new political power to the test by moving to reopen the federal government. democratic leaders have scheduled two votes on a package of bills to end the shutdown and give congress more time to negotiate a deal with the white house over border funding. but the bills still must clear the gop-controlled senate, and majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, has said he won't call for a vote to end the standoff unless president donald trump backs it.\n\napp could change the way we react to earthquakes\n\nlos angeles officials will formally announce a new app for apple and android smartphones thursday that may give residents a few seconds to prepare for an earthquake. similar to an amber alert, shakealertla will give warnings when significant shaking starts nearby, ideally allowing users to get to a safe place. the u.s. geological survey has been developing the alert system for the west coast since 2006, shakealertla says. users will only receive alerts for earthquake and aftershocks over 5.0 magnitude, which are deemed capable of creating damage and affecting public safety.\n\nprefer to listen? check out the 5 things podcast below and subscribe for free on apple podcasts:\n\npga tour begins 2019 with a notable absence\n\nthe sentry tournament of champions begins thursday in hawaii, but tiger woods will not be participating after speculation he could start his 2019 campaign at kapalua. woods has not played the toc since 2005, but will likely begin 2019 at the farmers insurance open on jan. 24 at torrey pines. among the notable players in the field in hawaii are defending champion dustin johnson, 2018 pga player of the year brooks koepka, rory mcilroy, justin thomas and bryson dechambeau.\n\ndidn't get what you want over the holidays? well, you're in luck!\n\nthursday is expected to be the second biggest day for holiday returns which will mean shoppers may face crowds or issues when exchanging or bringing back unwanted gifts. in anticipation for the annual return-a-thon, — ups is expecting returns to hit 1.3 million — retailers also have launched their after-christmas sales. according to the national retail federation's annual december survey, 50 percent of consumers plan to take advantage of after-christmas sales in stores and 45 percent plan to do the same online. if you plan on returning gifts, experts recommend reading store policies and deadlines to avoid post-holiday-gift-return headaches.

'the martian' crew keeping the party down to earth\n\na smiling matt damon entered the party, globe statuette in hand. after wading through a sea of well-wishers, he clinked glasses with his martian director, ridley scott. how will damon commemorate his potato-eating protagonist in the film? maybe i'll get (scott) a potato soufflé or something, said damon. scott's plans after the (many) party stops celebrating his movie's best comedy win were earth-bound. after that, bed, he smiled.\n\n3. jennifer lawrence's smooch\n\nlawrence, best dramatic film actress winner for joy, planted a bright orange kiss on director david o. russell's cheek. i'm gonna keep this lipstick, because of the respect that we were given tonight, he told us on his way into the party. you never know what's going to happen this (awards) season, and it may be all i get. lawrence met up with russell inside the party after a quick-change – she swapped her bright red dior gown for a short black versace dress.\n\nthe 'instyle' party had:\n\n4. photogenic pairs\n\nif there is no photo proof, did you actually attend the globes? everyone was snapping shots inside the instyle bash, which offered stars colorful macarons, a bumping dance floor and a venue bathed in purple lights. vanessa hudgens and boyfriend austin butler waited in line for the photo booth, while today show co-hosts al roker and natalie morales took videos of their entrance into the party. meanwhile, sisters kylie jenner and kourtney kardashian took selfies on a fan's iphone – because she had a cute accent, according to kardashian.\n\nranked: ricky gervais' greatest (and groaniest) golden globe jokes\n\n5.party traffic\n\nthe many globes after-parties are all held inside the beverly hilton, within walking distance from one another, so naturally, the stars like to party hop. on our way to the instyle bash, we saw: duet partners selena gomez and charlie puth power-walking from party-to-party, globe-winner brie larson changing locales after switching shoes (she had on flat jellies) and married couple ian somerhalder and nikki reed holding hands and getting ready to head home.\n\nthe hbo party had:\n\n6. raves for ricky\n\nat the hbo bash, a big star magnet that takes over the hilton's pool area and an adjoining restaurant, gervais got a thumbs up from a guy who knows what it's like to host a big show – brooklyn nine-nine star andy samberg. i loved him. i always love ricky. i'm always going to root for the comedian, though, said samberg, who received critical praise for the job he did at the emmys in september.\n\nsamberg said gervais delivered his trademark, edgy comedy. that's what he does. he doesn't care. he goes for it. he's a very brave comic, said the actor, whose fox series recently moved to tuesday as part of a two-hour comedy block. i think he embodies what comedy is, really about where he'll say the things that chill the room, but then he wins them back with a really great punch line, which is impressive. he doesn't back off anything.\n\namerica ferrera, eva longoria throw the classiest shade at golden globes\n\nwhen a reporter mentioned the ooohs that followed some gervais jokes in the interview room, samberg said, i was saying that. he did a lot of stuff i wouldn't do. the cool thing about gervais is that he genuinely seems not to care. that's when a comedian gets dangerous.\n\n7. khaleesi...and ned stark\n\nat the game of thrones table, there was emilia clarke, who plays khaleesi (a dothraki queen). and at one thrones table, it looked like there was an apparition. could that be ned stark, whose first-season beheading was an early sign of thrones' shocking twists and turns? it wasn't ned, but it was the actor who played him, sean bean.\n\nwhen a reporter told bean he was disappointed that ned got killed so early in the series, the actor replied, me, too. but bean, one of the stars of globes-winning film, the martian, is keeping busy. he finished a run on tnt's legends and he said he plays a centurion in the young messiah, which follows jesus christ at a young age.\n\nricky gervais calls sean penn a snitch over 'el chapo'\n\n8. han solo\n\neven in a room full of stars, harrison ford was a focus of attention at hbo, with partygoers, photographers and even other actors aware of his presence...\n\n9. a happy oyelowo\n\ndenzel washington's lifetime achievement award presentation was a highlight of the evening for david oyelowo, who was nominated for his performance in hbo's nightingale. denzel is my hero. to see him honored is fantastic, said oyelowo, whose a united kingdom and queen of katwe, the latter with lupita nyong'o, are scheduled to hit theaters this year.\n\n10. an uncanny connection\n\nwalton goggins, a star of quentin tarantino's the hateful eight, and tony goldwyn, the president on abc's scandal, shared a bear hug near at the base of the stairs leading into the party. how did they know each other? he directed episodes of justified, said goggins. (although many fans know goldwyn from his acting work, he's often busy behind the scenes directing and producing.) goldwyn marveled at goggins' performance in the tarantino film: isn't he great?\n\nreview: impish gervais pokes fun at globes, and its stars\n\nthe weinstein/netflix party had:\n\n11. a moët vending machine\n\nthat's right, guests could literally deposit a (free) coin to get a (free) mini bottle of moët champagne. we were so enamored we took a video.\n\noh, and there was a laura mercier beauty bar, too. #treats!\n\n10 must-know moments from the golden globes\n\n12. a surge toward katy perry\n\nhalfway through the party katy perry showed up and joined orlando bloom in a corner booth. the party surged in their direction, causing extra security to flank their tables. the two later left with a carful of friends.\n\n13. ricky gervais hamming it up\n\nby the time the globes host joined the bash (around 9:15 p.m.), gervais was ready to relax. to prove it, the comedian hammed it up by cheekily laying atop a banquette (most interesting man in the world-style). nearby, jamie foxx arrived (mini champagne bottle in hand) and promptly took selfies with model jourdan dunn and harvey weinstein. did we mention we saw aziz ansari pulling out his beyonce single ladies moves? because it was epic.\n\n14. helen mirren getting her groove on\n\nlook no further than mirren's cocktail table for the best vibes. that's where morgan freeman was sitting, and when stevie wonder songs came on, the two stars, plus their friends, got up and started getting down. (it only got better when the dj slid into jade's don't walk away.)\n\nricky gervais & mel gibson are the miley cyrus & nicki minaj of the globes\n\n15. costume changes\n\nlike j-law, at the weinstein/netflix bash fashion gals kate bosworth and olivia palermo both changed before they arrived. after her long, sparkly red carpet look, bosworth opted for a second embellished dolce gabbana number (this time featuring trousers). i'm not very good at being at a party in a train. this is a little more party friendly, she told us.\n\nricky gervais zings 'unfaithful' ben affleck at golden globes\n\nthe amazon party had:\n\n16. cool movie news\n\ntransparent actors jeffrey tambor and bradley whitford, both emmy winners, were among the stars attending amazon's party in the beverly hilton's top-floor stardust ballroom, as the streaming service joined other networks and studios hosting post-globes bashes. whitford said he's looking forward to his upcoming film, get out, which also stars catherine keener. key & peele's jordan peele will direct what promises to be an intriguing combination: a horror film that deals with race. i think jordan is one of the most talented people on the planet, whitford said. i can't wait to work with him.\n\nthe universal/nbc/focus features party had:\n\n17. amy and her new man:\n\ntrainwreck star amy schumer held court at a center table with her new boyfriend ben hanisch and her sister kim caramele, along with judd apatow and america ferrara. but come 9 p.m., schumer had enough, she blew a kiss to ferrara across the table and headed for the exit, with kim helping out with her gown's train. as they exited, they passed eva longoria who was posing for pictures with friends of her own.\n\n18. lots of trophies\n\nthere were winners to be had at the party. christian slater clutched his golden globe as he happily hugged longoria and received back-slaps as he sailed through the party. kate winslet dazzled as cameras came to life with her entry. but no one was more appreciative then her steve jobs co-star michael fassbender. he immediately stepped in front of the flashes to bow down, hands upraised, repeatedly to winslet and her new golden globe trophy. the smiling fassbender raised his head up long enough to hug winslet and engage in goofy conversation.\n\n19. typical boyfriend-girlfriend convos\n\nfassbender might not have won a golden globe trophy, but that did not dampen the irish actor's mood. he partied in a private area with girlfriend alicia vikander, who had her parents in tow. fassbender was a picture-taking machine, happily accepting party-goers' requests to pose for selfies. finally, vikander had to lay down the law as she readied to exit the party. michael, come on, she said with a smile. fassbender took a final picture with fans, gave a smiling, gotta go! and exited the party behind vikander.\n\n20. the everlasting eddie redmayne\n\nthe danish girl went home empty-handed from the golden globes. but director tom hooper was happy to party with his stars vikander (along with boyfriend fassbender) and eddie redmayne, who flew in from the set of fantastic beasts and where to find them on sunday afternoon. the jet-lagged redmayne stayed as long as he could at the party before departing. he's got amazing stamina, said hooper.\n\n21. a swift j.lo sighting\n\nhow do you know a party is dying down quickly? when jennifer lopez does a 180-degree entrance. lopez entered hand-in-hand with boyfriend casper smart, causing a string of party-goers to follow the star couple. but as lopez eyed the increasingly-celebrity-free event, she suddenly stopped on a dime, causing a pile-up of followers behind her. she made a sudden turn right and marched straight for a side exit, a security guard lighting up the carpet ahead of her to prevent any stumbles. all told, lopez, who previously hit the instyle party, was at this bash for less than five minutes.\n\n22. a sweet sign off\n\nnine-year-old room star jacob tremblay stayed out past 11:15 p.m., but was wide-eyed as he took final snaps on the empty red carpet before departing. he posed with his parents in front of a golden globe sign to remember the night. tremblay than walked towards the valet line, arm linked with his mother's, starring up at the lights before getting into the family car.
ap\n\ntuscaloosa, ala. (ap) — alabama left tackle cam robinson doesn't think an offensive coordinator change a week ahead of the national championship game will bother the crimson tide.\n\nsteve sarkisian took over the top-ranked tide's offense monday when lane kiffin left a week earlier than expected for his new job as florida atlantic's coach. both kiffin and coach nick saban described the move as a mutual decision, but it left only a week for sarkisian to get the offense ready for the title game against clemson in tampa, florida.\n\nrobinson said the perception outside the program with an offensive coordinator change this close to the national title game might be the world is coming to an end.\n\nbut not here, he said. we just go out and practice and do exactly what we've been doing all year. it's just a new voice. that's it.\n\nsaban said sarkisian knows the offense inside and out, and he's banking on that making for an easy transition for the title game.\n\nsarkisian, a former usc and washington head coach, has been an offensive analyst with the team this season.\n\nthe guy has been with us the whole year, the whole football season, saban said. he knows the offense. he knows the players. he's worked on the game plans every week. he knows the system inside and out, knows the terminology.\n\ni don't have any failsafe. i just feel like i have to make decisions based on what's best for the players to have the best chance to be successful and we made the decision and we're not talking about it anymore. we're moving forward and we're looking forward and everybody is going to do everything they can to support the people that are here now to make it work.\n\nalabama quarterback jalen hurts had just 57 yards passing in a 24-7 semifinal victory over washington, while backup tailback bo scarbrough ran for 180 yards. saban clearly didn't like what he saw in some respects from that offensive performance.\n\nwe had 25 negative plays in the last game so what do you think i saw? he said. we had poor execution, a lot of poor fundamentals. didn't execute well. weren't very consistent.\n\nsaban said he doesn't want to change the offensive philosophy but has other players he wants to get involved in the offense.\n\n___\n\nmore ap college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/ap_top25
ap\n\ndenver (ap) — nikola jokic considers himself a point guard who just so happens to be trapped in a center's 250-pound frame.\n\ni'm telling that to everybody, the denver nuggets standout said. but nobody believes in that except me.\n\nit's as good a description as any for the hard-to-label and even harder-to-stop play of the 7-footer nicknamed joker.\n\nhe doesn't exactly have the most athletic look or leap out of the gym, but he's elevated the western conference-leading nuggets to new heights this season. jokic is in line to become denver's first all-star since carmelo anthony in 2010-11 and is being mentioned in the mvp conversation.\n\njokic shrugs off all the attention. he's just an unassuming big man doing uncommon things on the court so often it's becoming common.\n\na 7-2 magic johnson, knicks coach david fizdale said as he over-inflated jokic's height in comparing him to the los angeles lakers hall of famer. he's as good of a passer as any guard in the league. he can shoot 3s. but his ball handling is something i admire.\n\njokic (pronounced yo-kitch) sees the floor with a point guard's vision, knocks down long-range jumpers with a shooting guard's poise and drives with a big man's mentality. he's earned the respect of san antonio coach gregg popovich, who's spent some time chatting with jokic. popovich appreciates the various levels to the game of the 23-year-old from serbia — enough to even rib him.\n\nhe's kind of pudgy, popovich cracked. he doesn't jump out of the gym. he doesn't run that fast, but he might be one of the smartest players in the league. and he's got skills and he knows how to use them and he enjoys the hell out of himself out there. he's been very important for them, obviously.\n\nat 24-11, the nuggets are tied for their best nba start in franchise history through 35 games with the 1976-77 squad. he's been a big reason why, averaging 18 points, 7.6 assists and 9.9 rebounds.\n\nhis recent play with three starters sidelined by injuries led tnt analyst charles barkley to anoint jokic as a front-runner in the mvp race. his co-hosts didn't exactly agree.\n\nwait, he's not impacting the game? barkley incredulously retorted.\n\nno arguments from the nuggets faithful. the fans serenaded jokic with a chorus of m-v-p after his third triple-double of the season — and 19th of his career — in a win over the knicks on tuesday. he took it in stride.\n\nwhatever they want to do, said jokic, a second-round pick in 2014 who signed a max contract over the summer worth around $147 million for five seasons. but maybe when we're finalists.\n\nreally, he's just a low-key player who in the offseason can be found back home in serbia hanging out with family, friends or his two race horses.\n\nask him about bella marguerite, the newest horse in his stable, and his eyes light up.\n\nshe's scared but calm when the race comes, he recently said. she's a completely different animal. she's fast.\n\nonce the ball goes up, he's a different breed of center.\n\nin some ways an anomaly, dallas mavericks coach rick carlisle said. he doesn't show super athletic ability. he plays the game close to the floor. but it's one of the great things about the nba game, guys like him that have the size and skill and know how to use leverage and angles and their vision and senses can be all-star-caliber players.\n\njokic grew up watching the likes of tim duncan, dirk nowitzki, boris diaw and shaquille o'neal. he's also been studying bill walton and hakeem olajuwon, to name a few.\n\nmixed a little bit of old and new guys, jokic said.\n\nit's hard to pinpoint his best game this season, but this one ranks up there: on oct. 20 against phoenix, when he joined wilt chamberlain as the only nba players to record a 30-point triple-double (35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) while being perfect (11 for 11) from the field.\n\nhe raised his game even higher with starters gary harris, paul millsap and will barton out of the lineup (harris and millsap have recently returned).\n\nhe's always carried the same demeanor, the same swagger, guard monte morris said. nothing's really changed.\n\nthis is something the nuggets hope will change: jokic making the all-star game . not since anthony wore no. 15 in denver — jokic's number now — has a nuggets player suited up in the game.\n\nif he doesn't make it, the great thing about nikola is that it will sting, we all will be upset and hurt by it, but it doesn't get in the way of our team goals, coach michael malone said. he's truly a team player. he cares about the team first. that's why he's a unique young man.\n\nas for jokic's assertion he's really a point guard in a center's frame, malone didn't quite buy it.\n\nhe's just a great player, malone said, trapped in a great player's body.\n\n___\n\nassociated press freelancer raul dominguez in san antonio contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nba: https://apnews.com/nba and https://twitter.com/ap_sports
washington – for the past year, federal law enforcement agencies have received tens of thousands of complaints of fraud tied to the coronavirus pandemic. more than 100 cases have been prosecuted, and authorities are expecting this number to rise as states continue to rollout vaccines.\n\nwe've been concerned about fraud schemes regarding the vaccine as soon as the vaccine went from an idea to reality. … the one thing that we've learned throughout this pandemic is that when there's money to be made, criminals will figure out how to do it, said fbi financial crimes section chief steven merrill.\n\nmerrill said he can't say how many complaints the fbi has received regarding vaccine-related fraud or how many have been elevated to criminal investigations. but he said officials have seen instances involving websites advertising fake vaccines.\n\nvaccine:how will i know when it's my turn to get vaccinated against covid-19?\n\nat least one fraud investigation has been made public in new york. the state's attorney general's office is investigating whether a health-care provider in orange county misrepresented itself to state officials to obtain vaccine doses and distributed them to members of the public who aren't on the state's priority list. parcare community health network said in a statement that it is cooperating with investigators.\n\nin late december, gov. andrew cuomo announced that health-care providers who fraudulently obtain vaccines could face up to $1 million in fines and loss of state license. cuomo also said this week that he plans to propose a bill that would impose criminal penalties to medical providers and other entities who sell or give vaccines to those who aren't yet eligible.\n\nfederal prosecutors in maryland also recently seized websites claiming to be biotechnology companies developing treatments for covid-19. authorities said the fake websites used logos of real companies to dupe victims into providing personal information.\n\nbad vendors: hundreds of millions of dollars goes to covid-19 contractors accused of prior fraud\n\nimproper ppp loans:thousands of ppp loans went to small businesses that should not have received them\n\nmerrill said authorities are on the lookout for medical providers asking patients to undergo unnecessary tests and procedures, bad actors seeking personal information from unsuspecting victims in order to fraudulently bill medicare, fraudsters asking people to pay out of pocket to obtain vaccines, and marketing representatives offering wholesale shipments of vaccines in exchange for fees.\n\nwe want to make sure that the public understands that the information they should be getting about the vaccine should not be coming from an advertisement or unsolicited information; it should be coming from an official government website, merrill said.\n\nmost vulnerable to scams are older people who may not be computer savvy and are more likely to have greater concerns about their health and ability to get vaccinated, merrill said.\n\neverybody is worried about putting this pandemic behind us and, as such, the emotion and the nervous energy that people have about this have caused many persons throughout the world to act more on emotion than logic. … i want to make sure that it's clear to the public to please consult with medical professionals before putting what you believe to be a vaccine or any other medicine in your body, merrill said.\n\ncoronavirus updates: 'premature' to change covid-19 vaccine dosing, fda says; new york reports first case of more contagious virus strain\n\nthe united states has more than 21 million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 357,000 deaths, according to john hopkins university data. so far, less than 4.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine even though more than 15.4 million have been distributed, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nthe fbi, the drug enforcement administration, the federal trade commission and other agencies have recently sent alerts warning of vaccine-related fraud.\n\nthe justice department has made prosecuting coronavirus-related frauds among its top priorities, charging individuals and companies for submitting fraudulent applications to obtain millions of dollars in government aids and loans for small businesses, hoarding and gouging prices of personal protective equipment, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nlast month, a cameroon national was accused of selling nonexistent puppies and other animals online as companions for socially isolated victims. authorities said fodje bobga and his co-conspirators charged hundreds of dollars a puppy and claimed the pets would be shipped to victims' homes. they later claimed transportation had been delayed and the unsuspecting purchasers needed to pay extra fees.\n\ncontributing: associated press

is so much divisiveness in our nation…it still tells people that there is hope and we should still be optimistic about the american dream. and it's really not one off. there are so many of us that are walking into congress that really are showing this nation that we are capable of having the american dream realized.\n\nfor her ceremonial swearing-in photo, tlaib put her hand on her koran. she also

when san antonio spurs assistant coach becky hammon took over for ejected head coach gregg popovich last week, she became the first woman to coach an nba team in a regular-season game.\n\nhammon, who is usually reticent on the topic, acknowledged the significance.\n\nobviously, it's a big deal, hammon told reporters after the game dec. 30. it's a substantial moment.\n\nthere's an even bigger moment looming: the day an nba team hires a woman as its head coach.\n\nit's right in front of us. it's going to happen, basketball pioneer nancy lieberman, who was the first woman to coach a g league team, told usa today sports during an interview last year.\n\nshe's not the only believer. toronto raptors president masai ujiri, whose raptors have women in key positions throughout the basketball staff, and richard lapchick, author of the detailed racial and gender report cards for sports leagues, also said it's on the horizon.\n\n'blow to the heart':lakers' lebron james responds to jacob blake ruling\n\ndurant out:expected to miss a week to quarantine after covid-19 exposure\n\nbut how soon? a season? two years? five years? hammon interviewed for the indiana job after last season, but the pacers hired nate bjorkgren.\n\ni would not be surprised if somebody isn't hired for the next season, lapchick told usa today sports in july. but i would certainly think that within a season, for sure.\n\nnba commissioner adam silver said in 2017 that it is on him to ensure that it happens sooner rather than later.\n\nwhen asked what it will take for a team to hire a woman as head coach, popovich gave a typical popovich reply: i'm not the answer man, he said. that depends on people and organizations.\n\nit is a thoughtful response.\n\nthere's no difference between a woman who knows the game and a man who knows the game, popovich said. it's just another prejudice that probably has to be overcome just like a lot of other prejudices in the world become less and less as people pay attention to them.\n\nit's a process, and it doesn't happen quickly but i think the more women there are, obviously it becomes more commonplace and more the rule and it'll depend on organizations realizing there are women who can do this. every woman can't. every man can't.\n\nbut the point is, there's got to be enough to choose from and it's got to become pretty commonplace before i think somebody's going to pull the trigger.\n\nsix female assistant coaches in nba\n\nhammon is one of six female nba assistant coaches with cleveland's lindsay gottlieb, sacramento's lindsey harding, new orleans' teresa weatherspoon, dallas jenny boucek and memphis' sonia raman. los angeles clippers' natalie nakase is listed as player development assistant and is working with franchise's g league team this season. milwaukee's sidney dobner is a video and player development assistant.\n\nthat marks a decline over last season's number of women coaches. niele ivey and kara lawson left nba jobs for top jobs with women's teams. lawson was an assistant coach for the boston celtics, and ivey an assistant for the memphis grizzlies but both took over prominent women's college basketball programs – lawson at duke and ivey at notre dame.\n\nkaren stack umlauf was not retained as a chicago bulls assistant when billy donovan replaced jim boylen, and brittni donaldson moved from an assistant coach with the raptors to the franchise's g league team. it's a strong possibility donaldson returns to the raptors when the pandemic subsides.\n\nnone of the new head coaches this season hired a women's assistant coach, though new orleans' stan van gundy retained weatherspoon.\n\nnba president of league operations byron spruell noted the league in 2019 partnered with the national basketball coaches association to create a deeper and more inclusive pool of coaching candidates.\n\nalong with women, the league is looking at coaches who are people of color. in a league that is 74% black, according to lapchick's most recent study, there were seven black coaches at the start of the 2019-20 season. there are seven this season even though nate mcmillan and doc rivers were not retained. rivers ended up in philadelphia and ty lue took over for rivers with the clippers.\n\nthe league has avoided pushing teams to hire one candidate or another.\n\nthe answer is ultimately yes to should the teams be able to hire who they want, silver said on sept. 30. i don't see a way to operate a league where the league office, the commissioner is dictating to a team who they should or shouldn't hire.\n\nhaving said that, i know we can do better. … we're in discussions with all of those teams about making sure there's a diverse slate of candidates. we've looked at what might be an equivalent to a rooney type rule in the nba, and i'm not sure it makes sense. i'm open-minded if there are other ways to address it.\n\nthe same approach applies to female coaches.\n\nwe want it to happen organically, and when the right opportunity matches the right person, this will happen, spruell said. we just feel we're so well positioned. if it happens tomorrow or the next day or this season or a few seasons away, we're really close. but we're not putting a timetable on it.\n\n'when she speaks we are all ears'\n\njust six years ago, hammon was the only women's assistant, and just three seasons ago, hammon and boucek were the only two. but teams see the value of hiring smart basketball minds regardless of gender, including the growing number of women in front-office roles.\n\nit's something that it's sad we have to talk about it, phoenix suns coach monty williams told usa today sports. we're all coaches. the coaching position has no gender. i've been around ladies who have coached the game. i'm blown away at the concept that we even have to talk about what do we have to do to get them (a head-coaching gig). …\n\ni'm saddened and frustrated on one end because we have to talk about it. at the same time, i'm glad we are.\n\nwhen asked about the topic in july 2019 at the nba's las vegas summer league, hammon said, i've said it before, half the population has not been tapped for their basketball knowledge. it's an untapped resource, and the more people can see how it works, the better.\n\nnba players on a team with a woman's assistant said they would have no problem with a female head coach. san antonio guard demar derozan said, when she speaks we are all ears.\n\nacross social media, nba players, including steph curry, ja morant and andre drummond, took note of hammon coaching after popovich's ejection.\n\nbecky's in a spot now where she's in a position of power, spurs guard patty mills told usa today sports. she's able to direct guys on what to do and that all comes from work ethic and what she does behind the scenes and getting herself and our team ready for games. she is an nba coach who knows her (expletive) and gets it done.\n\nin a cutthroat business, teams hire coaches who can generate success.\n\nthe players will know if you know something or not, lieberman said. if you're not qualified, you're not going to be there.\n\nlieberman also comprehends the pressure the first female head coach will face. they're going to be asked the same questions over and over, she said. are you good enough? why did you get hired? how come there's not enough women in the nba? is there going to be jealousy? c'mon, are you kidding? yes, there's going to be jealousy.\n\nthese jobs are really important, and there's some amazing male coaches in the nba. it's important, yes, for equality and that next step to happen. but it's also incumbent on us to know that we're also competing against some very highly accomplished assistant coaches and nba coaches. you don't get jobs any longer in life (based) on resumes. you get them on relationships.\n\nthat's why lieberman said it's important for teams to hire more women's assistant coaches. a lot of these women have not built the relationships on a level that maybe our male counterparts have, she said.\n\nexperience can change that.\n\nher knowledge of the game, the ins-and-outs of the game, is the reason why she's in the position she is, spurs guard derrick white said. it's the reason why she will just keep growing and growing and eventually become a head coach.\n\ncontributing: mark medina
associated press\n\ntampa, fla. (ap) — south florida has fired coach orlando antigua 13 games into his third season at the american athletic conference school.\n\nathletic director mark harlan announced the move tuesday, saying assistant coach murry bartow will lead the bulls (6-7, 0-2) for the remainder of the season.\n\nantigua leaves with a 17-48 record at usf, which hired the former kentucky and memphis state assistant under john calipari in march 2014.\n\nthe bulls went 9-23 in antigua's first year and finished 8-25 last season. the dismissal, with more than two years left on antigua's contract, comes three days after a 70-56 home loss to houston dropped the team's record under him in conference play to 7-30.\n\nharlan said in a statement that the change was made following a thorough and deliberate review of the program. a search for a successor will begin immediately.\n\nbartow's first game as interim coach is saturday at smu.\n\nbartow has served stints as a head coach at alabama-birmingham and east tennessee state. he was 103-83 in six seasons at uab from 1996 to 2002 and 224-169 over 12 seasons at east tennessee state from 2003 to 2015.\n\n___\n\nmore ap college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 .
washington – nearly 40% of judges president donald trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward lgbtq rights, according to a new report by the lgbt advocacy group lambda legal.\n\nthe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nour analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of lgbtq people as 'less than,' said sharon mcgowan, legal director for lambda legal.\n\ntrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the supreme court – an accomplishment made possible by senate republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for president-elect joe biden.\n\nafter four years as president, trump has appointed three supreme court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\n\na whiter judiciary:trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one hispanic nominee\n\naccording to lambda legal's report, released tuesday, the trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\n\nthis outpaced trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. during the obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. previous administrations going back to president ronald reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\n\ni think in many ways, trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the trump administration, mcgowan said.\n\nwhile the supreme court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of americans.\n\ntrump's legacy:biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\n\ncarrie severino, chief counsel at the conservative judicial crisis network, which has promoted and applauded trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\n\n(trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, severino said. the fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the constitution.\n\ntrump judges:trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nconversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\n\nthe report by lambda legal – which analyzed publicly available records on trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to lgbtq rights.\n\nin 2019, judge james ho, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a texas prison. ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nlater that year, judge david stras, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' first amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. the judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\n\nlast year, judge kyle duncan, whom trump also nominated to the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\n\nalso last year, two trump-nominated judges to the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting lgbtq minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. the american medical association and the american psychiatric association have discredited the practice.\n\nbut in the opinion, judge britt grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' first amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. judge barbara lagoa agreed with grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\n\nin a candid speech in november to the conservative federalist society, supreme court justice samuel alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\n\nyou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, alito said. until very recently, that's what the vast majority of americans thought. now it's considered bigotry.\n\nthe speech was widely criticized by democrats and advocates, including mcgowan. lambda legal also opposed alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\n\nmcgowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\n\nin the past, she said, lambda legal has won cases before republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against lgbtq rights.\n\nwe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by republicans or democrats. we did not oppose every single trump nominee. we did not paint them with the same brush, mcgowan said. but, she added, there should be a baseline below which we would never fall.\n\ncontributing: richard wolf
ap\n\nowings mills, md. (ap) — once considered a perennial contender, the baltimore ravens have gone two years without a winning season and reached the playoffs only once since 2012.\n\nafter going 5-12 last season, the ravens flirted with a postseason berth before dropping three of their last four games to finish 8-8.\n\nsomething's got to change if baltimore is to reclaim its position among the nfl's elite.\n\nthough coach john harbaugh conceded tuesday that the ravens desperately need to upgrade their roster — most notably at cornerback — he will stick with offensive coordinator marty mornhinweg, defensive coordinator dean pees and special teams coordinator jerry rosburg.\n\nmy heart, my gut and my head says this is the best way to go, harbaugh said.\n\nmornhinweg was promoted from quarterbacks coach to his current position in early october after harbaugh dismissed marc trestman. despite the shift, baltimore finished 17th in total offense and was ranked 28th in yards rushing.\n\njoe flacco threw for a career-high 4,317 yards and had 20 touchdown passes, but the ravens averaged 42 passes and 23 rushes per game — an imbalance harbaugh wants to see corrected in 2017.\n\nmarty believes in running the football, and i believe in running the football, harbaugh said. we have not run the football well enough or enough, really, for the last two years. that has to change, and i think it goes hand-in-hand with being good at it and doing it a lot more than we do it.\n\nterrance west led the team with 774 yards rushing and rookie kenneth dixon had 382. harbaugh expects both to be back next season, and hopes to add another couple of backs to the mix.\n\nharbaugh would also like to see flacco, the 2012 super bowl mvp, perform better in his 10th nfl season. his paycheck this season ranks third among nfl quarterbacks and restricted the ravens' movement within the salary cap.\n\nwe have a quarterback, and he's in that level of compensation, so we need to get him playing at that level, harbaugh said. we need to put a group and a scheme around him that puts him in that place.\n\nsome priorities for the ravens this offseason:\n\nfree agent shuffle: baltimore lists 12 unrestricted free agents, most notably nose tackle brandon williams, receiver kamar aiken, right tackle rick wagner and pro bowl fullback kyle juszczyk.\n\nthe ravens can't keep them all, especially because they're being squeezed by the salary cap and have many holes to fill.\n\neverything's on the table in terms of how we can improve, harbaugh said, and the financial part is a big piece of it.\n\ncornerbacks needed: baltimore's defense was ranked no. 1 through week 12. over the final four weeks, however, the ravens allowed an average of 28.5 points per game.\n\nthat shortcoming can be attributed in part because of the ankle injury that sidelined jimmy smith and left journeyman shareece wright and rookie tavon young as the starting cornerbacks.\n\nwe need to add more corners. there's no question about it, harbaugh said. if we can do that, that's going to dramatically impact our defense.\n\nhealthy flacco: coming off a knee injury that ended his 2015 season after 10 games, flacco didn't miss a start, but admittedly was not at his best.\n\nwhen you are only seven or eight months out of an injury, no matter what it is, there is going to be a growing process for it, flacco said. this offseason will definitely help with that.\n\nbounce-back year: the ravens have some decisions to make at tight end.\n\ndennis pitta led the ravens with 86 catches, a statistic that is noteworthy because he was returning from a second hip operation that sidelined him for the entire 2015 season.\n\ni'll be able to look back on this season and be proud of what i was able to accomplish, based on my circumstances coming in, pitta said. it's obvious that as a team, we fell short of a lot of our goals. but if i can take away anything, it will be that i was able to come back successfully and will be able to build on this moving forward.\n\npitta's contribution was necessary because the ravens were thin at the position, losing benjamin watson, crockett gillmore and maxx williams to injury. in addition, nick boyle was suspended for using performance-enhancing substances.\n\nif pitta, 31, is to return, it will be with a salary cut.\n\nclassy rookies: the ravens hope their 2017 class is as productive as the current class. ronnie stanley (drafted sixth overall) was solid at left tackle, dixon ran hard, young played decently on defense and special teams, and alex lewis was a fixture on the offensive line before sustaining an ankle injury in november.\n\ni feel like every single one of those guys is going to be a good player, harbaugh said, and a number of those guys have proven it already.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/ap
greenvile, s.c. – although she has dedicated her life's work to researching black history at clemson university, dr. rhondda thomas wants you to know she's not a historian. she's a storyteller.\n\neach story she discovers – whether it's infant katie, an enslaved girl who was listed on the deed of the plantation when it was sold to john c. calhoun's son in 1854, or jimmie gunn, a charlotte, north carolina-based musician who was invited to perform on clemson's all-white campus in the 1930s – is vital, the calhoun lemon professor of literature said.\n\nthomas tells these stories through call my name, a nonprofit research project (and now a book) that seeks to tell the public about the black people who helped clemson university and the land it sits on.\n\nwe strive to give every person that we identify a story ... because together, they create a beautiful mosaic of history that is painful. it has love, it has joy, it has horror. it has all of the human emotions that are associated with being on this planet, thomas said.\n\nfor months, thomas has been working to identify and tell the stories of the 604 people buried in unmarked graves at woodland cemetery, clemson's on-campus graveyard that sits under the shadow of memorial stadium.\n\nbut without remains – the red clay in which they are buried is acidic enough to dissolve bone – and without a lot of documentation, thomas is turning to the surrounding communities to help connect modern descendants and residents with the stories buried in the clay.\n\nthomas has formed a community outreach panel, which will begin work this month to connect the history, stories and research at woodland to communities in pendleton, clemson, central and seneca.\n\nthe panel's immediate goal is education, to shine a light on who is buried among the white faculty and alumni at woodland, which researchers believe include enslaved africans, sharecroppers, convict laborers and domestic workers who lived and worked in clemson up until the cemetery was formally dedicated in the 1920s, thomas said.\n\nwho were they? clemson university has found 604 unmarked graves on its south carolina campus\n\nwhile thomas doesn't know if they will be able to identify any of the people buried across the steep hills making up the cemetery, she knows many families in the area have ancestral ties to fort hill plantation and the many ways the land was used after it was sold.\n\nthose graves have been there for a long time. so we didn't discover them. they were recovered, thomas said. the university used ground-penetrating radar to determine the location of 604 graves, discoveries they announced in october.\n\nand now that the final resting places are known, the work to tell their stories begins.\n\nif (the public) believes they have family members that are buried on cemetery hill, please reach out to us. we want to talk to them, thomas said.\n\nwant to read more stories like this?:sign up for usa today's this is america newsletter\n\ntelling the complete history\n\nafter the nation's racial reckoning in the wake of george floyd's death in minneapolis in may, thomas said the importance of honoring black history has never been more important.\n\nhistory gives us an opportunity to learn about the past, and honor the past as we make decisions on how to live in the present and in the future. and because african americans were so integral to the development of our country, and at clemson university, it's a history that needs to be front and center, thomas said.\n\nsince floyd's death, clemson university trustees voted to remove two names of men known for racism, calhoun and benjamin tillman. calhoun was a slave owner and secessionist whose plantation became clemson university. benjamin pitchfork tillman was a governor and white supremacist whose name adorned clemson's most iconic building.\n\npresident jim clements established a task force on racial equity. clemson football players organized a black lives matter demonstration. hundreds of students have rallied together to demand more inclusive support for black students.\n\nbut even amid the activism and change of today, thomas said, the past can't be ignored. especially for black people, who are reminded of the legacy of racism and slavery in south carolina and beyond every time they look in the mirror, she said.\n\nit's very difficult for me to forget this history because it's written on my skin. i'm a descendant of enslaved people and slaveholders and slavers. and so every time i look in the mirror, i see that history. i can't leave it in the past, because it's written on my body.\n\nclemson university voted to tell the complete history of clemson in 2015, which includes the legacy of slavery and using convict laborers and sharecroppers to farm and build clemson's earliest campus buildings.\n\nthe work at woodland is just one part of telling that story, thomas said. the rest will come with activism, time and progress.\n\ni don't see the cemetery project as the game-changer. it's just something that we need to do.\n\nit's one of the many things that we need to do in order to fully embrace clemson's history, to connect with local african american communities, to sit down together and figure out how the university can be more supportive of the whole state as a land-grant institution.\n\nfollow zoe nicholson on twitter: @zoenicholson_
sally jacobs\n\npri\n\ngeorge keays is not a rogue kind of a man. a colorado real estate agent and grandfather of three, the 65-year-old practices yoga and meditates regularly. but the u.s. government, he says, has left him no choice but to break the law. if, that is, he intends to stay alive.\n\nkeays has stage 4 lung cancer. as his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits americans from going there for health care. now, with president trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. but keays needs more of the vaccine. this spring, he's going back.\n\ni am not looking to break the law. but i am not looking to die, either, keays declared. people with stage 4 cancer, like me, should be allowed to try whatever they want to stay alive, whatever they think will work. the last thing they need is the government on your neck over some archaic regulation saying just take what is available here and die.\n\nkeays has abundant company. in the two years since relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized under president barack obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to cuba for a vaccine called cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, vaxira. these patients are an elusive group. none of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to u.s. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the u.s. on their return. few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further.\n\ni can only see it as compromising him because now he has a patient on a drug that is not approved by the fda, said a patient in florida named larry, who asked that his last name not be used. larry has gone to cuba twice for the vaccine — both times without telling his doctor because, he might be afraid he would be sued, or he might stop treating me.\n\njust how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. in january, the roswell park comprehensive cancer center in buffalo, n.y., launched a clinical trial of cimavax with cuba's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccine. it is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the cuban revolution.\n\nroswell is now doing research to determine if they want to do a similar trial with vaxira. it will take years for either of the drugs to receive any final approval.\n\nfor many patients, including some who were not accepted into the roswell trial, travel to cuba has become a much-talked-about option. so popular has the practice become that patients on internet support groups routinely trade anecdotes and travel tips about their cuban journeys. until, that is, trump threw a wrench into the process.\n\nmajor changes for patients going to cuba\n\nthe change in regulations governing travel to cuba that went into effect in november altered one of the most popular categories of travel to cuba initiated by obama, known as people-to-people, which allowed travelers to go to cuba on their own. that's how many americans have been quietly going to the island for medical care, even though doing so is prohibited under the u.s. embargo against cuba. now, people in this category must travel with an organization and have a guide present.\n\namericans can continue to travel on their own to cuba for the purpose of professional research or to provide support for the cuban people. but given that travelers in those categories are required to maintain a full schedule of activities, it's likely that neither will be a good option for cancer patients.\n\nat the la pradera international health center in havana, where most american cancer patients go for treatment, dr. anabely estévez garcía felt the impact of the new regulations in her inbox as soon as trump announced back in june that the changes were in the works. american patients began canceling their plans in a flood.\n\nwe can not go at this time, a texas man emailed garcía on the day of trump's announcement. president trump changed everything today. it is not possible to go directly from here. keep us in touch.\n\na patient in new york on the brink of travel wrote that she had decided to wait a little longer. now, it will be harder to get there as our president has made it impossible to travel alone.\n\nnancy kelly, 71, a california patient who traveled to cuba for vaxira this past spring, emailed that she was worried about the new regulations, too. how would she replenish her vaccine supply when it ran out in october? she decided not to go herself but sent a friend to cuba to pick up more for her.\n\nit was important to get back to cuba before trump's restrictions went into effect, sighed kelly. with the new restrictions, i would need to go through a third country. the problem is that the vaccine has to be refrigerated, so, if you were on a long flight, that was going to be a problem.\n\nthe tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. another factor is the state department advisory issued this past september warning american citizens not to go to cuba due to alleged assaults against american embassy staff. investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in havana has been significantly reduced. for some travelers, it's all just too much.\n\nsince relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized at the end of 2014, the number of patients going to the plush la pradera clinic at the city's edge had risen steadily. in 2016, 50 americans came for treatment. last year, the number of inquiries about the vaccines tripled over the previous year, while 47 patients had already made the journey to cuba in the first eight months of 2017, according to garcía. now, the numbers have plateaued.\n\nthere are many patients who are suitable for treatment but who do not come for political reasons, said garcía, seated in a treatment room at la pradera this fall. as a physician, i feel very bad because i believe our vaccine is a good treatment that can extend these people's lives.\n\nbecause their own doctors are often not involved, patients wanting to go to cuba must make arrangements themselves. first, they get in touch with la pradera either through email or one of a number of medical tourism agencies in the u.s. or in canada. they then send their medical records for evaluation by la pradera physicians who determine if they are eligible for one of the vaccines, and if so, which one.\n\nunder the obama-era regulations, accepted patients usually informed the airlines issuing their visas that they were going for educational purposes or under the general people-to-people category. questions were rarely asked and most flew directly to cuba.\n\npatients stay at the la pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. one dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000.\n\nat p&g travel in ontario, long one of the more popular agencies among americans for booking travel to cuba, the numbers are both up and down. since trump announced in june that he would be reversing aspects of the obama administration's overtures to cuba, the number of americans booking travel directly from the u.s. to cuba through the agency has plummeted by 60%. instead, they're now going through third countries just like they used to do before obama's normalization of relations. since june, the number of bookings by americans going to the island from countries other than the u.s. has increased by 30%, according to tathiana gonzalez, the agency's cuba travel specialist.\n\nyou're either going to go or not go, said gonzalez. when you're given a month to live, you go. it's kind of basic.\n\nwhat they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or egf, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines.\n\ncubans research a lung cancer vaccine\n\nwhile cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. prompted by the country's high rate of lung cancer, researchers began work on a lung cancer vaccine back in the mid-1990s. in the most recent of several cuban trials, patients receiving cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. available to cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide.\n\ncimavax is currently available in cuba, colombia, peru, bosnia-herzegovina and paraguay. vaxira, which one cuban clinical trial indicates can extend life by up to two months, is currently undergoing more testing in argentina. it is available in that country and in cuba.\n\nroswell scientists began collaborating with havana's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccines, in 2011, and scientists from both countries have worked in one another's laboratories frequently over the years. in the roswell trial, cimavax is being combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, which blocks proteins on cancer cells, called opdivo.\n\nwhile talk of cimavax has circulated in american medical circles for years, much less is known about vaxira. roswell researchers are currently doing preclinical studies of vaxira in animals to determine if the vaccine merits a possible human trial. dr. igor puzanov, director of the early phase clinical trials program at roswell, said that it could take up to a year before a decision can be made on whether to proceed.\n\nwe know what the vaccine is supposed to do, he said. it's just too early to say if it does it.\n\nmeanwhile, at the center of molecular immunology, scientists are now focused on taking cimavax to a next step. they are working to extend patients' survival rate by identifying markers in those who are responsive to the vaccine. patients with high concentrations of the egf protein, for example, have been shown to be more responsive to the vaccine than those who do not. camilo rodriguez, a clinical researcher at the center who has worked on cimavax for 15 years, says he believes that eventually, the vaccine might be used on a host of cancers.\n\nwe feel that the vaccine could be very effective against prostate cancer, for example, because those patients often have a high degree of egf and that is related to the spread of cancer, said rodriguez, seated in his laboratory. eventually, we feel this could be useful in all kinds of cancer affecting the head, neck, bladder and prostate.\n\namerican doctors are not so sure. while some are cautiously optimistic about cimavax and await the outcome of the roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. dr. robert doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the university of colorado- denver and a senior editor of the american association for cancer research's journal clinical cancer research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug. someone in the room called out, do whatever cimavax does!\n\nwe all let out a collective groan, said doebele, who is george keays' oncologist. it was hilarious. the fact is that i spend several hours a month answering questions from my patients about this. it's very prominent on the internet and patients are understandably desperate to learn about it. but the fact is that we just don't know if this works yet.\n\ndr. roy s. herbst, chief of medical oncology at yale university and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. for the moment, he added, i am not too worried about people not being able to go to cuba.\n\nlike several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, doebele advised keays not to go to cuba for the vaccine. one reason for that is that keays is currently taking tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. doebele is concerned that if keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. but doebele has other worries.\n\nmy biggest concern is safety because of the lack of oversight and regulation. i can't control what he does; i don't even know where he's getting it. was it even a legitimate clinic where he got it? said doebele. i thought i'd talked him out of it.\n\nbut he hadn't. keays did apply to participate in the roswell trial, as doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. he became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. cuba.\n\nkeays arrived at the la pradera clinic in october and was advised that the vaccine most suited to his cancer was vaxira. after consulting with his family doctor, boulder internist william l. blanchet, who was traveling with him, keays received his first dose.\n\ntwenty minutes after i received it, i felt a little tired, but that was it, said keays. the next day, i went for an hour run. i felt great.\n\nif keays was impressed by the professionalism of the doctors, blanchet was even more so.\n\non paper, this looks very promising, blanchet said of the vaccine. it resonates as being medically sound and potentially a major addition. it's too soon to recommend it to patients, but i would make them aware of it and let them make the decision. if i was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, i would definitely go down and have this be part of my therapy.\n\none of the other patients at la pradera when keays was there was eduardo sanchez, of spain, a lean man with graying hair. diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer, sanchez said he, too, had exhausted most of the treatments available to him. like most american patients, he learned much of what he knew of the cuban vaccines on the internet.\n\nunfortunately, in spain, there is no information about the cimavax or the vaxira, he said. it's too early for me to say, but i am very hopeful.\n\nquestions on how to bring back the vaccine\n\nfor advanced stage cancer patients like sanchez and keays, going to cuba can be difficult in itself. the trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. now, american patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. the question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny.\n\nover the past two years, it appears that no one has been apprehended. the u.s. food and drug administration's personal importation policy allows some unapproved medications to be brought into the country, provided there is not an adequate alternative available in the u.s. and the amount does not exceed a three-month supply. but spokesmen for both the fda and u.s. customs and border protection say there is no record of either of the cuban vaccines having been brought into the country or seized at the border.\n\njust how to bring the vaccine into the u.s. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. judy ingels, 74, is one of them. diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, ingels went on tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. after she saw a cnn report on cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in santa rosa, calif., to havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. all told, the trip cost about $16,000. that she was breaking the law did not trouble her in the slightest.\n\ni just didn't get hung up on it, said ingels. my husband said, 'when they ask what your purpose is, just don't mention anything about medicine.'\n\ningels had no trouble carrying an eight-month supply of cimavax back into the u.s. in a hand-held refrigerated lunch bag. when she told the transportation security administration agent in florida that she was carrying a vaccine, he opened her bag and poked around but asked no questions.\n\nin the months that followed, ingels's tumor shrunk perceptibly, a fact that she attributes to cimavax. now, however, her supply has run out and she wants more. presuming that she cannot travel with a guided group, given her purpose, she is considering hiring one of several professional mules who will fly to cuba to get the vaccine for a fee. two of them contacted by pri declined to be interviewed.\n\nwe're weighing the options, said ingels. we might travel ourselves through the bahamas. but i have also talked to an individual who has offered to do this.\n\nnancy kelly, who had a friend travel to cuba on her behalf, was considering a return trip. but when a scan last fall showed that her tumor is growing, she changed her plans — at least for the moment. the change in her circumstance has not dimmed the retired administrative judge's anger at the government's imposition of limitations on american patients' ability to seek the treatment they want.\n\ni think it's absolutely outrageous. what trump has done makes it so much more difficult to go, said kelly. the restrictions that do not permit doctors in different countries to corroborate to help save lives is absolutely terrible.\n\n\n\nkeays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the vaxira nor the tagrisso is working. doebele has suggested keays go off the vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but keays continues to have faith. he's planning on returning to havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the vaxira vaccine. he has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. he's been on vaxira now for two months.\n\nin between doctor's appointments, keays has been working on a letter to the chairman of the u.s. senate committee on foreign relations, hoping he might intervene on patients' behalf. he's getting other patients to write, too.\n\ni intend to do whatever i can to expose how these restrictions steal the hope, and possibly, the life, from patients suffering with terminal cancer, as well as other sicknesses that might benefit from cuba's advances in medicine, declared keays. the ignorance in this new policy is astounding.\n\nin the meantime, for patients disheartened by an american government and doctors who seem to offer them only discouragement regarding cuba, there is one source of potential support: travel agents like tathiana gonzalez in ontario.\n\nunaffected by the u.s. regulations, gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of american patients' medical records to la pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. it's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. she's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to cuba have lived for years. like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the cuban doctors: are they accepted to go, or not?\n\nit's such an emotional roller coaster, exclaimed gonzalez. if they're not accepted, i cry because their cancer is so advanced. if they are accepted, i rejoice! i say, 'you're going! you are going to cuba!'\n\nthis story was reported with a

marco della cava\n\nusa today\n\nlooks like microsoft ceo satya nadella is, with apologies to the iconic '70s sitcom the jeffersons, movin' on up.\n\naccording to the los angeles times and other news reports, nadella has put his view-filled clyde hills, wash., home on the market for $3.5 million, nearly triple what the tech titan paid when he purchased the 4,000-square-foot home two decades back.\n\nthe four-bedroom, three-bathroom house, which was built in 1963, boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and a living room that offer panoramic views of mt. olympus, lake washington and downtown seattle. the property is being listed by tere foster of windermere real estate. the agency declined to client on the sale.\n\naccording to the realtor, the modernist home's clean lines and sleek steel anchor the free-flowing layout. views continue to the spacious main floor master suite. an open loft above the great room is a perfect spot for your library or office looking out to spectacular views. french doors open to emerald lawns and outdoor entertaining areas.\n\nas pricey as nadella's nearly half-acre property may be, there are 11 area houses that are more expensive on this realtor's site alone. the listings top out at $32.8 million for a four-bedroom, 11,500-square-foot lake-front home in bellevue. that of course still pales next to microsoft co-founder bill gates' extravagant 66,000-square-foot lake-front home in nearby medina, wash., which was built for $66 million and today is worth around $123 million.\n\nbut if they wanted to, the nadellas could spring for quite the showcase as their next home. since taking over as ceo in 2014, nadella - who joined microsoft in 1992 from sun microsystems - has added significantly to his wealth. in 2014, nadella earning $4 million in salary and bonus but also was granted $80 million in stock options. last year, his efforts to turn the one-time software king into a cloud- and mobile-first company earned him $18.3 million in salary, bonus and stock options.\n\nfollow usa todat tech reporter marco della cava on twitter @marcodellacava.
gregory korte\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — the day after a shooting spree in oregon last year, president obama said people who support gun control would just have to, for a while, be a single-issue voter if gun laws in america were ever going to change.\n\nthursday, obama said he'll follow that philosophy himself.\n\neven as i continue to take every action possible as president, i will also take every action i can as a citizen, he said in an op-ed for the new york times. i will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform. and if the 90% of americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve.\n\nobama explained his position in a televised forum on guns thursday night.\n\ni meant what i said, he told cnn's anderson cooper, saying the national rifle association has a stranglehold on congress in this debate.\n\nthe majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than what you see in washington. and the reason that washington doesn't work well in part is because the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence, obama said. and, you know, i'm going to throw my shoulders behind folks who want to actually solve problems instead of just, you know, getting a high score from an interest group.\n\nobama's pronouncement comes two days after white house press secretary josh earnest appeared to equivocate on that question, saying, i don't want to make a formal declaration here without having spoken to the president about it.\n\nobama to defend gun executive actions on cnn\n\nbut earnest also said it's unlikely that obama would ever have to choose between the gun issue and supporting a democrat. take, for example, sen. patrick toomey, r-pa., who co-sponsored a provision in 2013 that would have closed the so-called gun show loophole.\n\nthe president certainly gave sen. toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue. i think there are a lot of other things on which the president and sen. toomey disagree, so it's hard to imagine a scenario where the president is willing to campaign for sen. toomey, earnest said, i suspect that mr. toomey's democratic opponent, once he has one, will have at least as good of a record as sen. toomey does when it comes to gun safety and keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them, if not a better one.
dr. james n. pruden\n\nopinion contributor\n\nwhen i was young, i was told, as were many of you, that i had to be patient.\n\nit might come after a question like, are we there yet? or, while standing at the christmas tree waiting for some errant family member to get out of bed, it might have been, can i open my presents now?\n\nin that time of my life, i thought being patient just meant i had to sort of chill out. when i looked it up in the dictionary (truthfully, when i googled it) i found a bit more ominous definition: patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble or suffering without getting angry or upset.\n\ni contracted covid-19 in early march, at the beginning of the east coast experience. in fact, i was one of the very first admitted to my hospital for this condition.\n\ni say my hospital because i have worked at st. joseph's for nearly 40 years as an emergency physician, and have found it to be a wondrous experience.\n\nto say i was ravaged by this illness would be an understatement. of the 31 days i spent on the intensive care unit, 18 of them were spent on a ventilator. i lost 80 pounds, and could not even turn over in bed on my own. but more intense than the loss of weight (i needed to lose some) and the loss of strength was the never ending awareness that i could not get enough air.\n\nnew year, new america:all the things to leave behind in 2020\n\ni became the poster child for impatience when i had to lie flat for my second ct scan, which occurred just before my second intubation. lying flat made breathing so difficult that i remember screaming at the technicians to please, please hurry. it was the closest i have ever been to experiencing sheer terror.\n\nby the time i was being discharged for rehab, i could just about feed myself and brush my hair. fortunately, i am mostly bald headed so it did not take much effort to do that.\n\nwhat does this have to do with patience?\n\nwhen my fiancée, liz, and i made arrangements for an august wedding, we were active in our st. mark's church choir, we got pleasure in actually going to the movies and we just loved to dance.\n\nnow it was the middle of april, and i was oxygen dependent, i had no taste for food and i could barely stand with assistance, let alone dance.\n\nsomething to look forward to:good riddance to 2020. biden's win and the covid vaccine ensure 2021 will be better.\n\nalthough it has now stopped, for some still unexplained reason, flesh was peeling from my hands to the degree that my son christopher and i joked that i could use them in a zombie apocalypse movie.\n\nfor me, the guideposts for patience were embodied in the serenity prayer. you know …\n\ngod, give me grace to accept with serenity\n\nthe things that cannot be changed,\n\ncourage to change the things\n\nwhich should be changed,\n\nand the wisdom to distinguish\n\nthe one from the other\n\nthis was a chance for me to embody that prayer. the trick has always been defining that which i could change and that which i could not change.\n\nno one knew why the skin on my hands was flaking. perhaps it was a reaction to the 5,000 medications i had been given. the hope was that it would go away by itself, so i could listen to the beatles and let it be, or i could listen to the movie frozen'' and let it go, but i had to move on to something else.\n\nin order for me to learn to relearn to stand on my own, to walk, to lift things, the medical team would identify the specific deficit, and the physical therapists would drive me relentlessly to do it just 10 more times. i even gave them murderous nicknames, which only seemed to intensify their efforts. they were special.\n\nfront-line doctor:overworked doctors, nurses are getting vaccinated. here's why you should too.\n\nas for the oxygen dependence, i was having pain with each deep breath. i knew that pushing the envelope of pain was the way to overcome it, but i was finding that very hard.\n\nit ultimately took a significant turn for the better when liz and i were trying to dance and something terribly funny happened. suffice it to say that i was laughing so deeply i was forced to take deep breaths in spite of the pain.\n\nso as far as patience goes, i think one must strive to identify the things in our control and work hard to make them happen.\n\nmore important, one must accept the things that are beyond our control and let the fates do as they will. the hard part is knowing which is which.\n\nincidentally, liz and i danced for four hours at our wedding.\n\ndr. james n. pruden is an emergency medicine specialist at st. joseph's university medical center in paterson, new jersey. this column originally appeared in northjersey.com.
michael o'hanlon\n\nopinion columnist\n\nwhat should america's next president, democrat or republican, do about afghanistan? with an electorate tired of forever wars and a new pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with russia or china, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete u.s. departure is palpable.\n\ninstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the u.s. military mission in afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current u.s. deployment in iraq. that would allow the united states a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in afghanistan, as well as pakistan. the slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. that time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the afghan government and the taliban by the end of 2020.\n\nby the time america's next president is inaugurated on jan. 20, 2021, america's role in the afghanistan war will be approaching its 20th anniversary. afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the soviet invasion there in 1979.\n\nwe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\n\namericans are understandably tired of this war. it has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first obama term.\n\nhowever, the recent washington post story alleging that officials engaged in pentagon papers-like deception of the american public about the mission is badly misleading. whether it was the initial bush administration strategy on afghanistan, the mcchrystal review early in the obama years, or any of the subsequent obama/trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\n\nnonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. the afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. even more to the point for americans, the united states has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within afghan borders. the united states probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\n\nthe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. the good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\n\na future force of 5,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other nato military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 gis there. it would be 95% less than the 100,000 u.s. troops commanded there by gen. david petraeus and then gen. john allen at the peak of the american presence in 2010-11. this lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\n\nthe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. by laying out a plan designed to last for several years, washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter obama and trump years.\n\nthe number of u.s. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. the size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. but for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\n\npeace process:u.s. presidential hopefuls owe afghan women their support\n\nthis idea for a smaller but enduring u.s. military presence in afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the democratic base. but democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating president donald trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in syria.\n\nof course, trump administration policy could change dramatically before election day as well. absent a comprehensive peace deal with the taliban by next fall that also involves the afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor pakistan likely have in the idea — president trump will face a dilemma. he will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect america on the other.\n\nal-qaida remains present in afghanistan and just over the border in pakistan, where drones flying from bases in afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. the presence of the islamic state terrorist group in afghanistan has been growing, too. neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the united states.\n\neven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of america's and nato's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. thus, trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-qaida and isis.\n\nwe cannot fight without boots on the ground\n\nsome will say terrorism in and near afghanistan can be checked even without an american military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the taliban. perhaps any future al-qaida or isis presence on afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the indian ocean. or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in afghanistan.\n\nbut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\n\nwith 5,000 american troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in afghanistan, the united states could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at bagram near kabul in the nation's center, near kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either khost or jalalabad in the east. it also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in kabul, to help the afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\n\nit's time to leave afghanistan:take the deal, president trump; 18 years is enough\n\nthe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. it would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\n\ncommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to pakistan and the taliban that the new u.s. president would not be expecting a hail mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\n\nthe united states needs a policy that recognizes afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, u.s. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. that overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\n\nmichael o'hanlon, a member of usa today's board of contributors, is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and author of beyond nato: a new security architecture for eastern europe. follow him on twitter: @michaeleohanlon
heidi m. przybyla\n\nusa today\n\nwashington – president trump plans to press republican congressional leaders this weekend at camp david to make a major infrastructure package their top legislative priority this year, as his administration readies a blueprint he'll tout in the state of the union address on january 30, according to two white house officials.\n\nthe white house will release a proposal in mid to late january that will call for a wholesale change in the way the u.s. approaches big infrastructure projects, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is being finalized.\n\ntrump's pledge to renew the country's roads, bridges and airports was a major populist promise from his 2016 presidential campaign. but it was put on hold as gop congressional leaders pursued traditional republican agenda items in his first year in office, including tax cuts and failed attempts to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nat a presidential retreat in the maryland mountains this weekend, one official said trump will make clear that house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., should put infrastructure above other priorities including ryan's push to overhaul entitlement programs.\n\nsigning the tax bill late last year, trump challenged democrats to work with him on infrastructure in 2018. i really believe infrastructure can be bipartisan, trump said dec. 22. i actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road.\n\nyet trump's confidence that democrats – and republican fiscal conservatives – are willing to play ball on infrastructure may be overblown. the main pothole on the road to infrastructure improvements will be securing funding, which will be even more challenging after republicans pushed through a tax bill expected to add $1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade along party lines.\n\nthere's a desire among legislators in both parties to accomplish something significant in the area of infrastructure, said dave schnittger, a former deputy chief of staff to ex-house speaker john boehner, an ohio republican. but the idea of doing a large scale package begs the obvious question, which is 'how do you pay for it?'\n\nmore:trump signs tax and spending bills, challenges democrats to work with him on infrastructure next\n\nmore:trump order seeks to speed up infrastructure projects, but advocates say it will waste tax dollars\n\ntrump's plan would move the country away from a project-based system in which the federal government identifies infrastructure needs and gives money. the white house now plans to delegate that role to states and private investors, who would also provide the bulk of the funding.\n\nthe american society of civil engineers estimates that some $2 trillion is needed to upgrade the country's transit systems and address solid and hazardous waste, levees, ports, railways and schools.\n\nthe trump plan aims to generate $1 trillion for improvements, including a $200 billion federal funding commitment, according to the white house officials. the rest would be made up by state and local governments and private investors.\n\nthe federal dollars will go toward incentives for private investors, rural projects, and transformative projects such as high-speed rail or major tunnels, according to the officials. it will also include money for workforce development.\n\nthe plan to boost private sector participation would be a big change from the country's previous approach.\n\naccording to the nonprofit research group rand corporation, 97% of the funding for u.s. highways, bridges and roads comes from public sources. what's more, trump's own budget request for fiscal 2018 cut infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion.\n\nunlike with taxes, which passed with a simple majority, trump will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the senate to pass infrastructure legislation – which means he'll need at least nine democrats to sign on board. and many have said they are skeptical of placing so much responsibility for public works in the hands of private investors and localities.\n\nthey also may be wary of handing trump another major legislative win before the 2018 midterm elections. trump is pushing infrastructure to follow through on a major populist economic promise, especially with his tax bill being attacked as primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers and his efforts to renegotiate trade deals like nafta still in flux.\n\na former manhattan real estate developer, trump considers infrastructure, more than taxes and health care, in his wheelhouse, and his team sees rebuilding the country as an easy political win.\n\npeople forget president trump is a builder, said former trump senior communications adviser jason miller. infrastructure is an important next step in investing in our country.\n\nmore:trump: infrastructure to be 'envy of the world'\n\nwhat's more, the need for major upgrades is critical. the american society of civil engineers gave all u.s. infrastructure – including transit, including air, rail, roads and bridges – a grade of d+ for 2017. the nation's state of disrepair has been demonstrated by recent events including a major power outage at atlanta's hartsfield airport, amtrak rail derailments causing deaths and a new york city subway system in a state of disrepair.\n\nmore:amtrak accidents hurt safety reputation, but railroad remains popular with congress, riders\n\nfunding challenges\n\nyet trump's own legislative wins may now work against him.\n\nthe new gop tax law just made it harder for states and localities to raise money because property and income tax deductions aren't worth as much as they were in 2017. democrats warn that trump also extinguished a major potential funding source for infrastructure – a tax on overseas corporate earnings once floated by trump economic advisers – that was instead used to finance lower corporate tax rates.\n\nthere is also resistance among rank-and-file republicans to add to the deficit, especially right after the house voted for $81 billion in hurricane disaster relief. congress also needs to focus on finding additional spending cuts for a two-year government spending deal that is mcconnell's top priority versus forking over more money the infrastructure project.\n\nhelping states fund projects\n\nthe white house insists it is working on ways to help states finance projects.\n\na dozen federal agencies have been coordinating on the blueprint with d.j. gribbin, a special assistant to the president, who is the white house's point person on this issue. gribbin previously worked in the private sector on infrastructure public-private partnerships and for koch industries, the company owned by the billionaire gop mega donors and brothers charles and david koch.\n\nthe white house is open to hearing from states on ways to raise funds, including if they want to advocate for levying internet taxes that could help fund critical projects, according to the officials.\n\ntrump's idea to create a dedicated fund for rural projects is aimed at building support from a gop conference that hails primarily from rural areas and would struggle more than urban areas to finance their share of the costs or attract private investors.\n\nthe history on infrastructure spending on the hill has generally been split on urban and rural lines, not so much party lines, said debra knopman, the author of a recent rand corporation report on infrastructure. if your focus is on amtrak and fixing the northeast corridor, knopman said, many rural lawmakers aren't going to be as interested.\n\ncritical needs\n\nat issue is how to incentivize private companies to invest in projects that may be in the interest of public safety and commerce but not necessarily profit-making ventures, such as upgrading the lead-laced water pipes in flint, mich.\n\naccording to knopman's report, the federal highway trust fund and many of the state funds for drinking water and wastewater treatment plants have not been operating on a sustainable basis for some time now, and communities with declining tax bases struggle to maintain their roads, bridges, and water systems and repay their debts to bond holders.\n\nthere's a question of how far you can go with bringing in private investment to, quote solve the problem, knopman continued. and when it comes to places like flint, she said, there's just no market there.
associated press\n\nbono and the guys in u2 are big football fans, as in soccer.\n\nso when they sang about sunday bloody sunday and new year's day, they had no intention of describing the end of the 2016 nfl season.\n\nyet, the firings of chip kelly and trent baalke in san francisco, mike mccoy in san diego, and the resignation of gary kubiak for health reasons in denver certainly rang true to those rock classics.\n\nusually, the axings take place the day after the regular season concludes. except, of course, for the teams in a rush to get into the personnel market extra early, which in '16 were the jaguars (gus bradley), rams (jeff fisher) and bills (rex ryan).\n\non sunday, while other franchises were scrambling to make the playoffs or improve their postseason standing, the coaching carousel spun wildly in california. with fisher already canned in los angeles, kelly and mccoy became unemployed within an hour of each other.\n\nboth moves were predictable, as was the release of baalke, whose success as a gm with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how jim harbaugh molded and improved the players baalke gave him. baalke won a power struggle with harbaugh, who headed to michigan. the niners became historically bad without him, and baalke's choice of kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker jim tomsula after harbaugh left. at least tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than kelly managed.\n\nindeed, his only wins in a 2-14 record came against the rams, so maybe la owner stan kroenke will turn to kelly.\n\ndon't count on it.\n\ndespite my feelings for trent and chip, i felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary, 49ers ceo jed york said in a statement. the performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. we all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. that is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.\n\nthe new direction for the chargers looks like it will be north a bit to become a tenant of kroenke and the rams in the new inglewood, california palace that will open in a few years. mccoy's team lost its last five games and finished second for two straight seasons in the tough afc west. injuries tore it apart, too, but with the focus on whether the chargers would move to la, it was hard to judge what kind of job mccoy was doing.\n\napparently chargers chairman dean spanos wants a totally fresh start when the club abandons its long-time home.\n\nwhich means both of the new teams in los angeles, which was without the nfl since 1995 until the rams moved back last year, will be riding the coaching carousel.\n\nmore moves could be coming, too. is chuck pagano safe in indianapolis? might the saints do something with sean payton? what about bears coach john fox?\n\nsafe for another year are todd bowles and mike maccagnan, who the jets are bringing back. and cleveland coach hue jackson, despite a 1-15 record. and marvin lewis despite the meltdown in cincinnati.\n\nthe saddest news comes from denver. never was there a question about gary kubiak returning after leading the broncos to their super bowl win last february. but kubiak's health issues forced him to step aside, disappointing fans, players and john elway alike.\n\nwe love kube, we love how he treated us, said cornerback aqib talib. we pray he gets healthy.\n\ndenver won't have any trouble filling kubiak's spot. one of the hot candidates, for example, is atlanta offensive coordinator kyle shanahan, son of mike shanahan, who coached elway to two super bowl championships.\n\ngiven how well kubiak fit in the broncos' family, such a hire makes a lot of sense.\n\nthen again, sensibility isn't always a criteria in nfl coaching circles.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/ap_nfl

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe cornerstone of President Joe Biden's emotional appeal to the nation in his inaugural address was for a coming together. With unity we can do great things, Biden said. Important things.\n\nThe first important thing will be reaching an agreement with Congress on emergency funding to help defeat the coronavirus and cushion its impact on the economy. A pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans is an emergency that justifies deficit spending, as long as there is oversight to prevent waste and fraud.\n\nAdding to the urgency: New variants of COVID-19 are more transmissive and perhaps more lethal, so Biden's rescue package is the right idea at the right time. It just needs to be the right size.\n\nThe White House plan calls for $1.9 trillion in spending, after a year of COVID-19 emergency funding that has already added more than $2 trillion to a spiraling national debt. There's room to scale this back, particularly in light of a new Congressional Budget Office report that predicts a better-than-expected economic recovery.\n\nTen moderate Republicans countered with a $600 billion alternative, and Biden rightly agreed to meet with them on Monday, holding out hope for the kind of compromise 71% of Americans want to see.\n\nWhere is there room for agreement?\n\nFunding to directly fight the virus is a no-brainer. Biden is seeking $400 billion for this to correct massive shortfalls left by the previous administration: money to boost production of vaccines and protective equipment, open vaccination centers, hire health workers and, once and for all, expand testing and lab facilities. There's also $170 billion to help safely reopen K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning.\n\nBut the balance of Biden's proposal consists of direct aid to individuals, assistance for states and businesses, and a proposal to hike the federal minimum wage to $15 from $7.25 an hour. Places to cut include:\n\n►$1,400 stimulus checks. Nearly 10 million Americans still receive jobless benefits because of the pandemic, and a one-time check for $1,400 (on top of a $600 payout approved in December) would go a long way. As we argued then, however, any additional checks ought to be more narrowly targeted to the neediest.\n\n►Other direct aid. While extra unemployment benefits should be extended into summer (they currently end in March), it's not necessary to increase the federal supplement from $300 a week to $400. Other forms of aid — hikes in child and earned income tax credits, and child care assistance — could better be considered in a future Biden recovery plan that spells out ways to offset the cost through tax hikes. As it is, taking all the proposals together would provide a family of five an annual federal sum of $28,000.\n\n►Minimum wage increase to $15 an hour. This long controversial proposal is best considered as separate legislation that would index the federal wage to inflation and leave states and localities room to go higher.\n\n►A combined $500 billion in state aid. There is rich disagreement between Democrats who want this and Republicans who don't. A neutral analysis last September of state needs estimated a shortfall of $227 billion over three years, a more appropriate figure.\n\nBiden and Democrats could try to force through their oversized demands by using an arcane and rarely employed process known as budget reconciliation, in which a simple majority — and not the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate — would be necessary. But every Democrat, including moderate Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have to be on board, and a straight party-line vote would undercut Biden's promise of unity.\n\nReconciliation is an alternative if the Republicans refuse to meet Biden halfway. But if there's anything the parties ought to be able to agree on, it's a plan to get the pandemic under control, because little else is possible until that happens.

While the Democrats used almost all of the 24 hours allotted to them, Trump's lawyers went for short and sweet when they kicked off their defense Saturday taking only two hours to outline their case for exonerating the president. Trump's lawyers attacked House Democrats' credibility and accused them of omitting exculpatory evidence. They portrayed Trump as innocent of all charges and warned the senator-jurors against removing him from office – saying that would be an abuse of power and imploring them to let American voters determine Trump's fate in November.\n\nSpaceX set to launch Falcon 9 for Starlink internet mission\n\nSpaceX on Monday will take another crack at launching a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink satellites from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station after bad weather scrubbed a planned launch Friday. However, the weather forecast continues to be a concern for the Monday mission with 9:49 a.m. ET liftoff. This mission will mark the fourth full flight of a Falcon 9 with 60 Starlink satellites, bringing SpaceX's constellation to 240 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The initiative is designed to transmit broadband internet connectivity, including some underserved regions.

The Jan. 27 date coincides with the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945. This year marks the 75th anniversary. A memorial ceremony will be held in the U.N. General Assembly Hall that will include Holocaust survivors giving their testimony and a musical contribution by Itzhak Perlman. Last week, dozens of world leaders – including Vice President Mike Pence, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Britain's Prince Charles – visited Jerusalem to attend the World Holocaust Forum, the largest gathering focused on commemorating the Holocaust and combating anti-Semitism. For historians, the forum's main message was one of education amid signs of ignorance and indifference to the Holocaust.\n\nThe 2020 tax filing season opens\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will start accepting tax returns from individual taxpayers on Monday, kicking off the filing season when more than 150 million returns are expected to be processed.

But did they know the response would be so strong so quickly?\n\nWith the world we're living in now, I think everybody knew, forward Isaiah Jackson said at a press conference Monday. At the end of the day, people are going to say what they're going to say. People can do what they want. It's a free country.\n\nIt's a controversy that escalated quickly, and it's not as simple as a block or charge call.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nUK players decide to kneel before game\n\nUK players decided 90 minutes before Saturday's game they wanted to kneel during the national anthem, coach John Calipari said. Veteran players approached Calipari before the game about their intentions, he said, and the coach offered to join them.\n\nPlayers and coaches locked arms and knelt during the pregame national anthem, with Calipari placing his hand over his heart. The Wildcats defeated Florida 76-58, marking UK's third win in a row.\n\nWhy did the Wildcats kneel?\n\nCalipari and guard Davion Mintz said after the game the decision to kneel speaks for itself, while forward Keion Brooks said the action was in response to Wednesday's riot along with some other things that we don't see that go on every day that are unacceptable.\n\nCalipari defended his players from criticism immediately after the game.\n\nThese kids are good kids, the coach said. They care about this country and all the other stuff. They're trying to figure out life and making statements they think they have to make. I want to listen to what they're saying, and then I'll support them if they want me to be there.\n\nAs controversy brewed back in the Bluegrass State, the coach took additional steps to clarify what happened on his Monday night radio show.\n\nSix UK players come from military backgrounds, Calipari said on the program, as does Mitch Barnhart, the university's athletic director. What the Wildcats did Saturday wasn't intended to disrespect the military, Calipari said; it was intended to bring people together peacefully.\n\nStill, the coach said, the players have made their feelings known at this point. While their statement should not have been taken as a sign of partisanship or disrespect toward the military, Calipari said, he requested that his team's players work toward uniting people.\n\nLook, you did your civic duty, you voted. Now, you want to bring people together. Let's figure out how you do that. Some of this might be off away from the media, Calipari said he told his players. I don't want these kids to be in anything that separates — including our fans.\n\nGerth:Stivers sheds tears of a clown over UK basketball players kneeling\n\nHow did people react?\n\nYou wouldn't be reading this story if everybody had just accepted the team's statement and moved on.\n\nLaurel County Sheriff John Root and Jailer Jamie Mosley made a statement of their own. In a viral video posted on social media, the pair, who were kind of disgusted and outraged about the disrespect that (the Wildcats) showed last night, set two old UK shirts on fire. Mosley encouraged fans who felt the same way to come to the Laurel County Jail on Monday to exchange their Kentucky gear for Back the Blue pro-police shirts.\n\nMembers of the Knox County Fiscal Court, meanwhile, denounced the team in a resolution and called for elected officials in the commonwealth to reallocate tax funding from unpatriotic recipients to hardworking Kentucky Taxpayer's (sic) across this commonwealth, as the team's pregame gesture lacks respect for the veterans that have served our country.\n\nThe most emotional response, though, came from Stivers. He delivered an emotional address Monday night on the Senate floor, noting that as a father of an active military member and the nephew of a Korean War veteran, he was hurt by the team's actions.\n\nTheir pregame statement was legal, he noted, but Stivers — who said he condemns what happened at the Capitol riot — questioned whether Saturday's game was the right time and place to take action.\n\nHe asked people to think about the older people like me who have read these letters of their uncles and know that their fathers and their grandfathers served and were willing to serve even to the point they may not come back.\n\nIn a joint statement, Barnhart and university President Eli Capilouto stood by the team. In a country built on free speech, they said, it's important for young students to find their voices.\n\nWe won't always agree on every issue, their statement said. However, we hope to agree about the right of self-expression, which is so fundamental to who we are as an institution of higher learning. We live in a polarized and deeply divided country. Our hope — and that of our players and our coaches — is to find ways to bridge divides and unify.\n\nWhat has Calipari previously said?\n\nCalipari has spoken out on social issues and against racism before.\n\nIn 2016 he noted he'd seen employees at stores and airlines offer different treatment to him as opposed to Bruiser Flint, a Black assistant coach at UK.\n\nI've been on an airplane where we're in first class and they come over to me, 'Hey sir, would you like something to drink?' Calipari told reporters. And then they go to Bruiser, and what do they say to him? 'Can I see your ticket?' Can you see his ticket? You know me: 'Why didn't you ask me for my ticket? Why you asking him for his ticket?'\n\nAnd in 2017, a memo UK gave to players that outlined talking points with media members discouraged athletes from discussing prospects of an undefeated season or jumping to the NBA but had a different message when it came to racial unity.\n\nOn the current social issues and political landscape, we are NOT going to tell you not to answer these or to express your opinion, the memo read. Some things are bigger than basketball, and the current landscape is.\n\nWhile the memo specifically stated players were welcome to speak out about social issues, it did request that those athletes know the facts and be prepared to deal with people who may disagree.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIn the press conference Monday, forward Olivier Sarr said the team had not yet decided whether to continue to kneel during the national anthem in upcoming games, though the team has not been on the court for the anthem during home games this season at Rupp Arena in Lexington. Kentucky hosted Alabama on Tuesday night, and both teams stayed in the locker rooms for the anthem.\n\nCalipari said he still wants his players to express themselves peacefully in a heated political environment. In his eyes, however, the next steps should be about finding ways to unite fans.\n\nI said, you can stand up and scream and all the things, but at the end of the day, what are you doing to bring people together? he said. (We're) trying to keep these kids on track, trying to focus, trying to keep our fans being positive about these kids. That's why I keep coming back to how they pick people up and what they do. That's everything we've been trying to do here.\n\nSarr, who thanked Calipari for joining the Wildcats on one knee, said unity was the point of their statement.\n\nI think it sends a big message, Sarr said. We're a unit, and that's what we want this country to be. We are all together in it.\n\nContributing: Jon Hale, Emma Austin and Billy Kobin.
The Internal Revenue Service's handling of its private debt-collection program is harming lower-income Americans who can least afford to repay tax debts, a federal watchdog warned Wednesday.\n\nThe program also may be a waste of money, based on the cost of the program and a review of the actual payments recovered.\n\nWhile Congress directed the IRS to use private debt-collection firms to seek nearly $400 billion owed, the tax agency also was expected to follow an existing rule designed to ensure that taxpayers have an adequate means to provide for basic expenses, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said in the annual report to Congress.\n\nBut the watchdog's review of tax returns filed as of late September by 4,141 taxpayers who made tax payments after their cases were assigned to private collectors found that 19% of the group had incomes below the federal poverty level. These taxpayers had a median income of $6,386, the report said.\n\nAdditionally, 25% of the group had incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level, a common low-income marker. They had a median income of $23,096, the report said.\n\nMore:That call from an unlisted number? Might be a collections rep for IRS\n\nIRS turns to debt collectors to call about unpaid taxes\n\nThe IRS likely would have given these taxpayers hardship status and classified their debts as currently uncollectible if the tax agency had handled the accounts itself, Olson wrote. Instead, the tax agency assigned the cases to private debt-collection firms that don't conduct financial analyses before contacting the taxpayers for repayments, the report said.\n\nNo one is making the IRS make these bad decisions, wrote Olson, who called the actions an end-run around Congressional safeguards. The harm to these taxpayers is something IRS leadership consciously decided to do despite my personal efforts, and those of my organization, to stop it.\n\nThe report additionally suggested the private debt collections are a waste of money.\n\nThe tax agency assigned nearly $920 million of inactive tax receivables to private collection firms through Sept. 14. About $7 million, or less than 1% of the total tax debts assigned for collection, had been recovered as of that date, the report found in a review of IRS data.\n\nThe costs totaled approximately $20 million through Sept. 30, with roughly $1 million in commissions paid to the private debt-collection firms and the rest covering other program expenses.\n\nThus, it does not appear that the (private-collection agencies) are particularly effective in collecting the debts assigned to them, Olson's report said. In any event, the cost of the (private debt collection) program thus far exceeds the revenue it generates.\n\nThe IRS said private debt collectors return cases to the tax agency if a taxpayer said she or he was unable to make repayments now or in the near future. Although revenue from the collection program has been low, it is projected to increase over time, the IRS said.\n\nThe new criticism of private debt collection focuses on a controversial program the IRS launched at the direction of Congress in 2017, years after previous versions of private debt-collection efforts ended with limited success.\n\nConsumer advocates have argued that scammers potentially would harm taxpayers by posing as representatives of the private-collection companies used by the IRS. Separately, the union that represents IRS employees has said those workers would do a better collection job at less cost if Congress gave the IRS sufficient personnel funding.\n\nThen-IRS commissioner John Koskinen said in April when the collection effort launched that the tax agency would work to ensure that the four companies chosen for the job would work responsibly and respect taxpayer rights.\n\nWhile urging taxpayers to beware of potential scammers, Koskinen said the only people being contacted by the companies are taxpayers who had been contacted earlier by the IRS about overdue tax payments.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc
Jordan Wathen\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhereas people bought homes with bank loans before the housing crisis and dot-com stocks on margin during the 1990s tech bubble, most people aren't using borrowed money to buy bitcoin. At least, that's what we think.\n\nTruthfully, there's little way to know how billions of dollars in daily bitcoin transactions are financed, because cryptocurrencies are largely bought and sold on unregulated markets. But it seems evident, at least to me, that a small portion of the bitcoin market thrives on other people's money, and lenders may be left holding the bag on bitcoin's plunge.\n\nBuying bitcoin on credit\n\nA recent LendEDU poll of bitcoin investors found that 18% of buyers used a credit card to make their investment. Of those, 22% could not afford to fully pay off their balance after buying the digital currency, suggesting that speculators were risking more than they could truly afford to lose.\n\nThe findings corroborate with other data that suggest credit cards may have helped fuel bitcoin's boom in 2017. As the price of bitcoin soared, the number of Google searchers looking for a way to use credit cards to buy the cryptocurrency jumped, too, reaching a peak in the week of Dec. 3 to Dec. 9, 2017.\n\nCredit card balances increased markedly at the same time bitcoin was soaring. Revolving consumer credit balances increased at an annual rate of 9.9% year over year in October 2017. In November, balances jumped by 13.3%, according to the Federal Reserve. To put the increases in perspective, consider that revolving balances increased at a 7.3% annual clip in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nMore: Bitcoin drops below $10,000; $30B value wiped in a day as cryptocurrency sell-off deepens\n\nMore: 4 reasons cryptocurrencies shed $304 billion in value in just 3 days\n\nMore: Bitcoin sell-off deepens, digital currency now down 50% from recent peak as Dow closes above 26,000\n\nBanks are backing away\n\nSome banks are turning off their customers' ability to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on credit. Based on numerous reports, Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) began blocking credit card transactions at known cryptocurrency exchanges on Jan. 12, 2018, when bitcoin had already lost a third of its value from its all-time high set one month earlier.\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart, Capital One said that it is currently declining credit card transactions to purchase cryptocurrency because of the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss, and volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. It also said it would continue to evaluate allowing its customers to use their cards to buy digital currencies.\n\nThat a major credit card company is actively standing in the way of bitcoin purchases suggests, at least to me, that it found something it didn't like in the cohort of customers who had used their cards at online currency exchanges.\n\nLittle room for error\n\nIn light of declining prices of digital currencies, credit card lenders may have to set aside more cash for increased defaults, weighing on their profits. Capital One's domestic card business earned pre-tax income of $748 million on average balances of $93.7 billion in the third quarter of 2017. What it set aside for losses was roughly double what it earned in pre-tax profits that quarter.\n\nWhen margins are razor thin, any loan loss can be a significant loan loss. That goes double for credit card issuers, who often see their non-interest expenses increase with their loan loss provisions, as they spend more money trying to collect on bad debts.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that the plunge in digital currency prices is likely to result in an economic catastrophe quite like the 2008 financial crisis. Far from it. But I suspect that bank earnings may take a bitcoin-related hit as bad debts emerge from the rubble of depressed cryptocurrency prices.\n\nJordan Wathen has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

MIAMI — The NFL might not have seen the last of Donald Trump.\n\nDespite being rebuffed in his efforts to buy the Buffalo Bills, and the leaguewide revulsion to his profane call to fire protesting players, Trump remains an NFL fan. And given the, oh, how shall we say it, intensity of his time in the White House, one associate said he could see the president trying to buy an NFL team again after he leaves office.\n\nI remember him telling me once, when we were meeting about the Buffalo Bills, he said to me, 'Look at these guys. Do you see how much fun they're having?'  said Michael Caputo, who helped Trump with his bid for the Bills and later was an adviser to his presidential campaign. I know it's not all fun and games. But I think after the presidency and the flames of politics he's walked through, he might be looking for a little more fun.\n\nI think he's found his life's work, Caputo added. After the presidency, he'll be looking for his life's hobby.\n\nAt first glance, Trump and the NFL would seem to be the most awkward of fits. His experience as an owner in the USFL was an unmitigated disaster. In fact, many involved in the league have said Trump led the USFL to ruin in hopes he could parlay it into buying an NFL team. Not exactly a trustworthy partner.\n\nThe NFL is also almost exclusively a billionaire boys club, emphasis on the billionaire, and it's no longer certain Trump qualifies. His former attorney, Michael Cohen, has testified Trump inflated his net worth during his attempt to buy the Bills.\n\nUSA TODAY INTERVIEW:Antonio Brown says 'I put myself in a bad predicament'\n\nSPECIAL REPORT:Super Bowl site Miami leads NFL in one category: player arrests\n\nThen there's the matter of where Trump's money comes from. He might not disclose his tax returns to the American people, but the NFL wouldn't approve any prospective owner without knowing the source of every dollar, ruble and riyal.\n\nAnd, with the exception of Jerry Jones, most NFL owners prefer to stay in the background unless they're hoisting a trophy. To say that isn't Trump's style is putting it mildly.\n\nAnd yet, the NFL is also exactly Trump's kind of people. Not the players, of course. More than two-thirds of the players in the league are black, and many have made no secret of their feelings about a president who has a penchant for demonizing people of color.\n\nWhen the Eagles won the Super Bowl two years ago, in fact, they actually found themselves uninvited to the White House because so many players said they wouldn't go. (Though, can you really be uninvited if you've already said you aren't going to go?)\n\nAsked during Monday's Opening Night how they would feel about having Trump as an NFL owner, most players begged off the topic. But one, Chiefs fullback Anthony Sherman, said he'd have had no problem playing for Trump.\n\nI think he would have been a great owner, he said.\n\nSan Francisco cornerback Richard Sherman wasn't so sure. A lot of owners aren't as involved and aren't as boisterous or around or seen by their teams, Sherman said. I'm sure he'd be more prevalent.\n\nFor many owners, though, Trump's management style, as well as his history of racism and bigotry, might not be a disqualifying factor.\n\nWoody Johnson, owner of the Jets, is Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom. He and eight others donated to Trump's campaign or inaugural committee.\n\nIn August, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, then a member of the NFL's social justice committee, hosted a fundraiser for Trump with tickets ranging from $5,600 to $250,000.\n\nHe counts NFL stars and owners among his closest friends, Caputo said.\n\nSo what of his blistering criticism of the league two years ago, during the height of the player protests? Besides it being perfect fodder for a stunt that could gin up his base – he ordered Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of a game because some 49ers players demonstrated during the anthem – it was actually an indication of just how badly Trump craves NFL approval. Kind of like the 6-year-old boy who pulls the hair of the girl he likes.\n\nHe's been elected president, where maybe a great goal he had in life to own an NFL team is not very likely, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA TODAY Sports at the time. So to make it tougher, or to hurt the league, it's very calculated.\n\nIt's about money, or messing with – trying to soil a league or a brand that he's jealous of.\n\nOne way or another, Donald Trump is determined to get his piece of the NFL.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Any woman who isn't investing money in a 401(k) plan – or maybe only sets aside a tiny amount – needs to realize that the retirement game is stacked against her.\n\nWomen are more at risk in their older years for economic insecurity, said Amy Matsui, director of income security and senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere are some thoughts to motivate everyone from their 20s to 60s to stick to New Year's resolutions and save far more aggressively in 2019:\n\nThere's a gender gap in retirement\n\nThe wage gap that women experience in their working years morphs into a gender retirement gap.\n\nUnfortunately, women have less income rather than more when it comes to retirement, Matsui said.\n\nBased on today's wage gap, a woman who worked full time, year round would typically lose $406,760 over a 40-year career, according to a report by the National Women's Law Center. The example assumes a constant wage gap of $10,169 each year.\n\nTo make up that lost money, a woman who fits this example would have to work nearly 10 years longer than her male counterpart.\n\nMore:From a chance of a recession to interest rates: 5 things to know about your money in 2019\n\nMore:How banks are helping you budget and track your money to avoid overspending\n\nMore:Why Ohio bitcoin tax gimmick is like paying with Beanie Babies\n\nTaking home less money, of course, means a woman has less discretionary income to set aside toward savings. A smaller nest egg ultimately would threaten economic security later in life.\n\nWomen in nearly every occupation face a wage gap, according to Matsui. Women in the United States, who work full time, year round are typically paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, according to the National Women's Law Center.\n\nStarting out at a lower wage often is hard to overcome, especially when raises or pay in a new job ends up being based on previous salary histories.\n\nMatsui noted that women find it harder to save for retirement several reasons. They tend to earn less than men. They're more likely to be low-wage workers. They're more likely to leave paid work to be caregivers. They're more economically affected by divorce.\n\nAnd they're more likely to work part time or for small employers, and may not be able to participate in a 401(k) plan as a result.\n\nSome experts note that some women may be held back because they aren't comfortable demanding a raise; others may be unwilling to apply for promotions for jobs that would conflict with raising children.\n\nLong lifespans mean bigger bills\n\nAfter a couple reaches age 64, two-thirds of the women will outlive their husbands by almost 12 years, according to a 2016 study by TIAA.\n\nThe expenses associated with living alone are dramatically higher than when two people are able to share household chores and expenses. Matsui noted that women also may be more reliant on their spouse's retirement benefits.\n\nWomen age 63 on average end up with only two-thirds of the retirement savings and benefits that men do.\n\nWomen face higher health care expenses\n\nWomen age 63 and up are projected to spend 30 percent more on health care in retirement than men, according to a study by HealthView Services.\n\nWomen may be more likely to suffer through chronic illnesses and may be less likely to benefit from a spouse who serves as a caretaker.\n\nMen and women have different life journeys\n\nWomen often can face a wealth gap, in part, because of family or life expectations set for women – ranging from parenting to care-giving duties for elders.\n\nTwo-thirds of care provided to older adults is done by women, whether involving a parent, grandparent, parent-in-law or other family member or friend, according to a Merrill Lynch-Age Wave study.\n\nLeaving a job or cutting back on hours to take care of young children or older adults can lead to lost benefits and promotions, in addition to extra out-of-pocket costs. The average caregiver spends $7,000 a year on their care recipient.\n\nMothers also experience a mommy penalty, a pay gap that is three times that of non-mothers because of lost income and missed opportunities for promotions caused by breaks from the workforce, the Merrill Lynch-Age Wage study noted.\n\nAs for good news, more women are going to college and may have access to better paying jobs than their mothers or grandmothers.\n\nWomen now graduate from college and graduate school in higher numbers than men, according to the study, which boosts their career options.\n\nAbout 42 percent of women ages 18 to 64 have a bachelor's degree or higher. That's up from 25 percent in 1992.\n\nHowever, women are juggling more student loan debt and then are likely to face the gender pay gap.\n\nWomen now hold about 65 percent of all student debt, according to the Merrill Lynch study conducted in partnership with Age Wave.\n\nIt's harder for women to save and subsequently invest if they are simultaneously paying down debt and accumulating less income, the Women & Financial Wellness: Beyond the Bottom Line study conducted in partnership with Age Wave noted.\n\nSuch statistics, of course, are depressing to read but they're realistic in many cases, according to Melissa Spickler, managing director for the Merrill Lynch office in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.\n\nMillennials need to pay attention early on, she said, and begin saving for retirement as soon as they begin working. If one doesn't have a 401(k) plan at work, it's possible to set aside money elsewhere using other retirement savings vehicles, such as a Roth IRA.\n\nMany times, Spickler said, women may not want to save for retirement when they're newly married because they think they have many years ahead to worry about retirement.\n\nOr the husband may argue that the couple can use the woman's salary to pay the bills, while the husband dedicates more pay toward retirement savings.\n\nBut she recommends that women start saving for retirement as soon as they get that first job and keep doing so throughout their lives.\n\nSpickler said some women may be less willing to seek outside financial advice, which they need, and instead depend too much on a husband to take care of all financial matters.\n\nWomen tend to be more risk averse when it comes to how they're investing their 401(k) savings, as well, according to the TIAA report called Income Insights: Gender Retirement Gap.\n\nMany times, women will have more money parked in cash instead of invested in mutual funds than men do, which can hold back how much money they'd ultimately have in retirement.\n\nEven young workers who may be paid the same amount of money at the same company won't necessarily be equally well off in retirement.\n\nIn order for two recent college graduates to have the same amount of money saved for retirement, the young man would need to save 10 percent of his salary, while the woman would need to save 18 percent, according to the TIAA study.\n\nShelly-Ann Eweka, a director of financial planning for TIAA in Denver, said many young women at the start of their careers might not take into account that one day they might stop working to care for children or an elderly parent.\n\nSome women, she said, also won't see the raises or promotions that their male counterparts would receive.\n\nThey may not realize that going forward in the future that they'll work less and they'll get paid less, Eweka said.\n\nTo deal with those challenges, women need to save more money upfront for retirement, she said. And they need to diversify their investments, including stocks and annuities into the mix, in order to build healthier retirement balances. TIAA has a site called Woman2Woman at www.tiaa.org that lists tips.\n\nWomen won't have an easy time playing catch-up.\n\nOften, experts say, it's hard to find a good-paying job in one's field of expertise after leaving the workforce to be a stay-at-home mom or serve as a caregiver for another family member.\n\nWe are always the ones that stop our work, Spickler said. Everyone else always keeps on working.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.
AP\n\nMADRID (AP) — Croatia midfielder Luka Modric has appeared in court in a tax fraud case in Madrid.\n\nOfficials said Tuesday Modric was in court for about 10 minutes along with his wife and lawyer. The player's wife, Vadja, is also being accused of tax irregularities.\n\nSpanish prosecutors have accused the Real Madrid midfielder of defrauding tax authorities of 870,728 euros (about $1 million) in 2013 and 2014.\n\nLocal newspaper El Mundo says Modric has already paid nearly 1 million ($1.2 million) to tax authorities to try to reach a settlement even though the player has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCourt and tax officials say they cannot confirm or deny the payment. Details of Modric's court appearance have not been released.\n\nModric has been playing for Madrid since being signed from Tottenham in 2012.\n\nSeveral other players have been targeted by Spanish tax authorities recently, including Lionel Messi who two years ago was found guilty — along with his father — for defrauding 4.1 million euros ($4.9 million) from income made from image rights.\n\nOther players investigated include: Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcelo, Ricardo Carvalho, Angel Di Maria, Javier Mascherano, Radamel Falcao and Fabio Coentrao.\n\nFormer Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, currently at Manchester United, is also being investigated.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Spanish soccer coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/LaLiga
Sarah Skidmore Sell\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nIt's a new year and time to put the last one to bed, which means filing your taxes.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service says to expect a few changes when the nation's individual income tax filing season opens on Jan. 23.\n\nHere are some of the changes you should be aware of:\n\nNEW DATE\n\nTaxes are usually due on April 15, but this year that falls on a Saturday. And Emancipation Day, a holiday in Washington, D.C., will be observed on Monday, April 17.\n\nSo that pushes the nation's deadline to file returns and pay any amount due to April 18.\n\nYou don't have to wait until then to meet with a tax professional or start the process though.\n\nDELAYED REFUNDS\n\nA new law may delay refunds for some low to moderate income taxpayers who file early.\n\nThe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, known as the PATH Act, requires the IRS to withhold refunds on tax returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit until mid-February. The change is designed to give the IRS more time to detect and prevent tax fraud.\n\nThe affected refunds will start being released on Feb. 15 but they may not arrive in bank accounts until the week of Feb. 27, as it will take more time for financial institutions to accept and deposit the refunds. The three-day holiday weekend involving President's Day on Feb. 20 may also affect the timing of when funds are available.\n\nThe IRS said it still anticipates issuing more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days.\n\nThose with questions can use the Where's My Refund? tool on the ?on IRS.gov website and the IRS2Go phone app to find projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15.\n\nNEW ID NUMBERS\n\nThe PATH Act also requires that certain individual taxpayer identification numbers, known as ITINs, be renewed.\n\nAny ITIN that hasn't been used on a tax return at least once in the past three years, as well as any ITIN with middle digits of 78 or 79, must be renewed before a return can be processed. Anyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delays, as well as denial of some tax benefits until the number is renewed. An ITIN renewal application could take up to 11 weeks to process during tax filing season.\n\nITINs are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt's official: Government shutdown becomes the longest in history\n\nThe partial government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, entered its 22nd day early Saturday, making it the longest in history. The previous longest shutdown on record lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes. On Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The shutdown is the result of an impasse between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Negotiations stalled again this week after Trump abruptly left a White House meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The president traveled to Texas Thursday to review the situation at the border.\n\nNFL's best weekend loaded with playoff action\n\nFrom The Immaculate Reception to last year's Minneapolis Miracle, the divisional round of the NFL playoffs has produced some of the greatest games in NFL history. This weekend's slate of games begins Saturday afternoon with the Colts visiting the Chiefs (4:35 p.m. ET, NBC). At night, Cowboys fans in L.A. will storm the Coliseum to watch Dallas take on the Rams (8:15 p.m. ET, FOX). The action continues Sunday as Philip Rivers and the Chargers travel cross-country to play Tom Brady and the Patriots (1:05 p.m. ET, CBS) and concludes with the defending champion Eagles visiting the New Orleans Saints (4:40 p.m. ET, FOX). Check out who our NFL staff thinks will advance to the conference championship games, along with who's on upset alert and the X-factors for all four games.\n\nMidwestern states brace for winter storm to hit the region\n\nA winter storm system packing snow, sleet and ice is bearing down on more than 20 million people this weekend, with heavy snow expected from Denver to New York City. The storm will most likely disrupt travel in the mid-Atlantic as it settles in on Saturday night. Motorists along key Interstate highways will be hardest hit, especially the I-64 and I-70 corridors of the Plains and Midwest. For many areas, this will be a long-duration winter storm event that lasts more than 12 hours and perhaps as much as 48 hours in some cases. Most of the snow should be over for the NFL playoff game Saturday in Kansas City, and forecasts indicate New England will escape the snowy onslaught for the game in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Sunday afternoon. Several major airlines are also waiving change fees.\n\nStars pay tribute to Aretha Franklin at Los Angeles concert\n\nJennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, Celine Dion, SZA and Patti LaBelle are among the artists who will pay tribute to Aretha Franklin at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on Sunday.Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul, which will be televised by CBS at a later date, was announced by the Recording Academy and is the latest in a recent series of Grammy tribute events, including concerts devoted to Stevie Wonder and the Beatles. The tribute concert comes days after MGM announced that Liesel Tommy will direct the long-gestating Franklin biopic, Respect, starring Jennifer Hudson as the Queen of Soul. Franklin died at the age of 76 in August from pancreatic cancer.\n\nFrance prepares for revived anti-government protests\n\nAuthorities in France have deployed 80,000 security forces nationwide for a ninth straight weekend of anti-government protests. The movement, which waned over the holidays, appears to be resurging despite President Emmanuel Macron's promises of billions of euros in tax relief and an upcoming national debate to address demonstrators' concerns. Online groups mounted calls through the week for actions in Bourges, a provincial capital with a renowned Gothic cathedral and picturesque wood-framed houses, and the suburban Paris business district of La Defense. But authorities warned that could be a ploy to draw police away from key sites in the capital, which epitomizes the power and wealth that's the target of the provincially driven protest movement. Protesters want deeper changes to France's economy and politics, seen as favoring the rich.\n\nContributing: Associated Press
Patrick Brennan\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — One of the first things Linda Windey did after picking up her $1 million prize in Wednesday's Powerball drawing was take a needle in her arm at the blood drive in front of Kentucky Lottery headquarters.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt just made sense. I had a million dollars fall out of the sky, said Windey, 41, of Parish, N.Y., who bought her winning ticket in Walton, Ky., while staying with family.\n\nEverybody is fixated on who might have the three winning tickets sold in California, Florida and Tennessee for the $1.586 billion grand prize, but Windey was one of 73 $1 million winners in 23 states across the USA, according to Multi-State Lottery Association officials. Eight of the more than 26 million tickets sold were $2 million winners because they paid an extra dollar to kick in the Power Play option.\n\nThe single mother of three children ages 10 to 17 matched the five white balls on one of her three tickets but not the red Powerball. She said she has no grand designs for spending her windfall and doesn't plan to stop working.\n\nState lottery: Winning ticket sold in Chino Hills, Calif.\n\nShe wants to spend wisely and provide for her children, she said.\n\nIt's the wrong time to be irresponsible, said Windey, who drove her family Thursday to Louisville to claim the prize.\n\nShe has been living with her brother in Bethel, Ohio, east of Cincinnati, so she could work a temporary job at the eBay distribution center in Walton. She has worked as a nurse in the past and said at a news conference that she has had financial struggles.\n\nI'm just thinking I can take better care of my kids now, said Windey, a longtime lottery player.\n\nHer ceremonial check may have had $1 million written on it, but the federal government automatically withholds 25% of the winnings and Kentucky takes out 6%. That puts the amount of money that she takes home at $690,000, but it won't be all that she'll owe eventually in taxes.\n\nHead-of-household taxpayers with a taxable income of $441,000 in 2016 will end up in the 39.6% federal tax bracket, according to the Tax Foundation. And her status as a temporary Ohio resident and permanent New York resident may mean additional payouts that only an accountant can decipher — and potentially closer to $500,000 in money that's really hers.\n\nWindey's 17-year-old son, Edward Blunt, said his mother had played the lottery for as long as he could remember but never won more than $20 on a single ticket.\n\nThe idea of winning became a running joke between him and his mom, the teen said.\n\nCatfish or Powerball winner? Internet freaks out over skateboarder's claim\n\nSo when Windey woke up her son at about 2:30 a.m. with news of their bounty, he was skeptical, thinking it was a continuation of the joke, he said.\n\nI just went back to bed, Edward said. I didn't believe it.\n\nAt first, Windey didn't believe it either.\n\nI checked the numbers six or seven times, she said.\n\nContributing: Sheldon S. Shafer, The (Louisville) Courier-Journal.

Major-college sports' never-ending fight over competitive balance has a new point of contention.\n\nThe federal tax-law changes passed in December 2017 included the creation of an excise tax on the pay of non-profit organizations' most highly compensated employees, a levy that targeted any college or university with a coach or athletics director making big money.\n\nHowever, while many athletics departments are now facing a substantial new expense, there also are schools that employ some of college sports' highest-paid coaches and will not have to pay, according to newly issued guidance from the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service and the schools' assertions of their federal tax-exempt status through documents posted on their websites and statements to USA TODAY Sports from school spokespeople.\n\nThe excise-tax provision was supposed to cover all non-profit organizations, imposing a 21% levy on compensation above $1 million — including bonuses — that goes to any of their five highest-paid employees in a year.\n\nMore:Opinion: The three biggest questions in college football for the 2019 season\n\nMore:Season grades for all 130 college football teams in the Bowl Subdivision\n\nThe guidance means that the provision has created three groups of schools: Those that clearly will have to pay the tax; those that can claim they won't have to pay; and those that currently have to pay, but might have the ability change their status.\n\n►Private schools and public schools carrying one type of federal tax-exempt status clearly will have to pay. For example, Duke faces a significant tab based just on men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski's pay, who has made more than $5 million for years, according to the school's federal tax filings.\n\n►Other public schools — including Texas, Texas A&M, Clemson, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston — can claim they will not have to pay because they assert that they are government units that have federal tax immunity without holding any other tax-exempt status. Whether they ultimately will take this position remains to be seen. If Texas A&M does, it would save close to $1.4 million related just to the compensation of football coach Jimbo Fisher, whose basic annual pay is $7.5 million.\n\n►Public schools that have another type of federal tax-exempt status are currently subject to the excise tax, but the new guidance also says these schools may voluntarily relinquish that status, although doing so might still leave them subject to the excise tax. Alabama, Michigan, UCLA and at least a dozen other public schools in Power Five conferences are in this group, according to documents posted on the schools' websites. Alabama football coach Nick Saban's $8.3 million in basic compensation, plus $875,000 in bonuses, for this season means the school faces more than $1.7 million in excise tax for him alone.\n\nYou've got a major competitive imbalance here, said Roger Denny, an executive compensation attorney with the law firm Spence Fane LLP who assists USA TODAY Sports with its annual compilation and analyses of college coaches' compensation. You have schools from the same states and the same conferences that are going after the same recruits, and you have an artificial restraint that affects hiring decisions at the highest level of those programs. …\n\nAnd there's a trickle-down effect to that: You have a difference of $500,000 here, $1 million there (in the cost of paying a coach and the excise tax) and that can be the difference in being able to go after the best coordinator in the game or hiring a football staff full of analysts as some schools have done, or installing a camera system in your gym to help the basketball teams with video study, or putting WiFi in your stadium.\n\nThe excise-tax provision was an effort by Congress to bring high-paying non-profits into alignment with publicly held corporations, which cannot take tax deductions on pay above $1 million for certain employees and are now subject to a basic tax rate of 21%.\n\nIt also was at least symbolically part of an offset to wide-reaching tax cuts, plus it had the bonus of clear, high-profile targets: Colleges and universities paying coaches enormous sums. So, no school — public or private — was supposed to be spared.\n\nBut the new Treasury/IRS guidance doesn't take into account Congressional intent. It's based on what the law actually says.\n\nThe positions reflected in this notice constitute a good faith, reasonable interpretation of the statute, the document says.\n\nFormer House Ways and Mean Committee chair Kevin Brady, R-Tex.. has circulated a draft of a bill that would make technical and clerical corrections to the tax-law changes, including one designed to make the excise tax applicable to all public colleges and universities. For now, though, the new guidance means Treasury intends to enforce the law as it is written, Denny said.\n\nHad Congress' drafting matched its intent, Texas would be set to owe taxes based at least on football coach Tom Herman's $5.5 million in basic compensation and men's basketball coach Shaka Smart's $3.2 million. That would have come to 21% of $4.5 million for Herman ($945,000), plus 21% of $2.2 million for Smart ($462,000).\n\nTexas' athletics revenues and expenses were both in excess of $200 million in fiscal 2017, according to school's most recently available NCAA financial report – but the $1.4 million in tax that would have been connected to Herman's and Smart's pay is more than what Texas spent to field a men's tennis team that year.\n\nTexas says its tax-exempt status comes from the university being a branch of the State of Texas, and the new Treasury/IRS guidance says the excise-tax provision was written in a way that means the tax does not have to be paid by a school that is a governmental unit and does not have another form of federal tax-exempt recognition. Texas' position is similar to the ones held by Clemson, Texas A&M, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston.
WASHINGTON – Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants a lower overall price tag.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, doesn't want a minimum wage increase included.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer still wants a bold and robust bill.\n\nCompeting interests, a thin House majority, and a Senate composition that gives an enormous amount of power to individual members mean President Joe Biden faces an uphill climb to pass his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.\n\nMore aid for Americans could be on the chopping block, including a one-year expansion of the child tax credit, $1,400 stimulus checks and a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. The pending impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and Republican resistance to the overall price tag also loom large.\n\nThe argument is centered on a key question: Are all of the bill's provisions related to the pandemic?\n\nTrump's second impeachment trial:As the numbers suggest a Trump acquittal, Senators explore censure and brace for impeachment trial\n\nRep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., the co-chair of the moderate House Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the inclusion of the minimum wage increase could make the package seem like it was contaminated by partisans who wanted to use it as a vehicle to legislate on things that are not related directly to the crisis.\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a key moderate, said the minimum wage increase was important to Democrats but really has nothing to do with COVID relief, pointing instead to provisions like the last package's $300 boost to unemployment benefits as a higher-priority agenda item.\n\nBiden says he's open to some negotiation, but not all\n\nBiden's proposal includes a broad variety of policy priorities, including $20 billion for national vaccination program, expanding unemployment insurance supplemental payments to $400 per week, expanding to 14 weeks paid sick and family and medical leave, and allocating $25 billion in rental assistance and an additional $5 billion to cover home energy and water costs.\n\nBiden and several administration officials have said they are open to negotiating the $1,400 stimulus check or the threshold around who will receive it.\n\nWell, there's a legitimate reason for people to say, 'Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or why?' Biden told reporters Monday. I'm open to negotiate those things. That's all.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday on the Senate floor that the first draft of Biden's proposal misses the mark. He said he would support a smart and targeted package rather than what he called an imprecise deluge of borrowed money.\n\nMore:The filibuster may make it difficult for Joe Biden to pass his agenda - even in a Democratic Congress. Here's why\n\nMore:Homeland Security worries extremists 'emboldened' by Capitol riots may cause more violence\n\nAnd key Senate Republicans like Collins have concurred. She told reporters Monday she wanted a package that would focus solely on the pandemic rather than include a wish list of Democratic priorities like an increase to the minimum wage, though she said she would support debate over the minimum wage in a separate bill.\n\nDespite the Biden administration's openness to negotiate, Biden indicated it may be difficult to take out certain policies from the package as they are hand in glove issues.\n\nI'm reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here, and then have to go through it again to – because these all are kind of – they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues, he said.\n\nDemocrats may decide to go it alone via reconciliation\n\nSchumer signaled Wednesday that he might move forward without Republican support anyway.\n\nWe must not repeat the mistakes of 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid to confront the national crisis, he said, referring to the federal government's relief packages passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that progressives derided as too small to fully restore the American economy.\n\nThe Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, with Vice President Kamala Harris available to break ties. That means that for most legislation, Democrats need to secure at least 10 Republican votes to pass a key procedural hurdle and break a potential filibuster. In the House, Democrats hold only a three-seat margin, leaving little room for error.\n\nIf they are unable to secure enough Republican support to break a filibuster, Democrats can skip that process if they use a procedure known as budget reconciliation, where they can pass legislation with a simple majority but are subject to certain rules that could make it more difficult to include some Democratic priorities like the $15 minimum wage increase.\n\nWhen asked about passing the bill through reconciliation, Biden said that decision will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate.\n\nBoth sides have used reconciliation to attempt to pass major legislation in the past. Republicans tried to use the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, but failed when three Republican senators voted with all Democrats to reject the repeal. Republicans later succeeded, however, in passing a major tax code reform through reconciliation.\n\nNonetheless, Republicans are sure to raise objections if Democrats attempt to do so with COVID-19 stimulus.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R- Mo., a member of Senate Republican leadership, predicted Tuesday that litigation was possible if Democrats tried to force a minimum wage increase through the budget reconciliation process.\n\nMore:Now majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer explains plans for the nation, NY and impeachment\n\nMore:DC police details Capitol riot officer injuries\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said it would be irresponsible for Democrats to push through a package through reconciliation while negotiations were ongoing.\n\nGive us a chance, he said.\n\nPortman is part of a bipartisan group of 16 senators and two House lawmakers who met with top Biden administration officials by Zoom on Sunday. The lawmakers pressed the administration on the justification for the price tags for all of the programs the administration wanted included in the package.\n\nBut progressives are unfazed by Republicans' opposition to using reconciliation. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is the incoming chair of the Senate Budget Committee, told reporters Wednesday, The minimum wage has got to be raised to 15 bucks; we think that can be done by reconciliation and I think I can get that done.\n\nLawmakers have also raised concerns about their ability to work on COVID-19 as former President Donald Trump's impeachment looms over the Senate. The trial could put a halt to most work in the chamber as lawmakers deliberate over Trump's fate.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., told reporters Monday that they had a two-week window to make progress on a COVID-19 relief deal before legislative progress might grind to a halt. Still, other senators took a longer view of negotiations.\n\nRomney told reporters Monday that the key was to have something in place that will extend unemployment insurance after March 14, when it's due to expire.\n\nSchumer, for his part, insisted Tuesday that the Senate will be able to work on Cabinet nominations, impeachment, and COVID-19 relief simultaneously.\n\nThe Biden administration wants to pass the relief package in the next month. Biden said Monday that time is of the essence.\n\nThere's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes ...there needs to progress in the next couple of weeks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. She added that if the relief package was not passed soon, there would be a point where there would not be enough funding for vaccine distribution or funding to reopen schools this year.\n\nMore:Worried about your financial security?

Arlington\n\nOne of the most important species of fish in the ocean's food chain is getting a close look to help determine the health of its population. Two arms of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission are working on an assessment of the menhaden stock. The commission is an interstate board that regulates coastal fisheries. Menhaden are small, schooling fish that play a critical role in the ocean's health because they are important food for whales, larger fish, seabirds and others. They're also harvested commercially for use as fish oil and aquaculture feed. The Atlantic States commission says the health of the menhaden population will be the subject of meetings in Arlington in early April intended to inform the management of the Atlantic menhaden fishery.
Toyota and Mazda have reportedly picked Alabama as the location of their new $1.6 billion, 4,000-job assembly plant, capping a national race to score the biggest economic development prize in years for the auto industry.\n\nThe Japanese automakers are set to announce that they will locate their new joint-venture factory in a state that already has Toyota, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz factories, according to Reuters and the Birmingham Business Journal.\n\nThe move suggests that Toyota and Mazda may be poised to capitalize on a sharp increase in state tax incentives recently signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey.\n\nIt also reflects the strength of Alabama's manufacturing sector. The state assembled more than 1 million vehicles in 2016 at plants employing nearly 40,000 workers. The statewide unemployment rate was 3.5% in November.\n\nAlabama was long viewed as one of the leading contenders for the factory because of its tax incentives, low-cost labor and bustling automotive sector. The state's factories are also not unionized — a factor that seems to appeal to foreign automakers.\n\nOfficials from Toyota and Mazda declined to comment late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nReuters reported the plant would be located in Huntsville, while the Birmingham Business Journal reported the factory would be built at a mega site in Limestone County just west of Huntsville.\n\nA spokesperson for Ivey would not immediately comment on the reports, and other local officials could not be reached.\n\nJob-creating projects of this magnitude are rare. It would be only the fourth new U.S. assembly plant in about the last decade when it opens in 2021.\n\nToyota and Mazda announced their deal to collaborate in August, saying they would make a decision on where to locate the facility after Jan. 1.\n\nThe announcement marked a victory for President Trump, who had disparaged Toyota for selling vehicles in the U.S. that are made in foreign markets. About half of Toyota vehicles sold to Americans are made domestically, according to Barclays.\n\nBy contrast, Mazda imports all of its U.S.-sold vehicles.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
Tina Orem\n\nNerdWallet.com\n\nIt's never been easier to do your own taxes, with software getting more user-friendly each year. But as your financial picture grows more complex, it's perfectly sensible to wonder if you're missing something and should get someone to prepare and help file your taxes.\n\nHere are some scenarios that can clarify whether you ought to hire a professional tax preparer or keep going it alone.\n\nWhen it's probably OK to DIY with tax software\n\nYou're a steady Eddie\n\nIf all of your income came from your employer, you're not itemizing on your return and nothing complicated is going on in your life, tax software could be a good choice, says Marianela Collado, a certified financial planner at Tobias Financial Advisors in Plantation, Fla.\n\nConsistency is also key, says Karl Frank, a certified financial planner and president of A&I Financial Services in Englewood, Colorado. If your tax situation is the same as it was last year and you're not taking many deductions, then software may be a great tool, he says.\n\nYou understand what the software is asking you\n\nIf you have some knowledge and you're comfortable navigating through the prompts and understanding the questions, then I think it's OK, Collado says.\n\nHowever, if, for example, the software asks whether you contributed to your employer's 401(k) plan, and you don't know the answer or don't know why it's asking the question, you probably need to meet with a human tax preparer, she says.\n\n» Know where you stand? A tax calculator can help\n\nWhen it's probably time to get help filing your taxes\n\nYou have a business or a side gig\n\nFreelancers, independent contractors and people with side gigs should hire a human tax preparer, Frank says. There are extra forms to fill out, along with many rules about the right way to report your income and even more rules about how to handle your expenses.\n\nIf this is you, then it's really advantageous to have a human being to talk to at least once a year for an hour or two — you may be paying more [tax] than you need to, he says.\n\nYou don't understand the forms you GET in the mail\n\nIf the tax forms landing in your mailbox are completely foreign to you, take them to a human preparer. For instance, Collado says many people are thrown by something called a K-1, which may arrive if they invest in certain types of companies.\n\nThey don't know what to do with it, she says. They should have a CPA. There are special rules on how to treat those things.\n\nYou actually want advice\n\nTax preparation involves a lot of data entry, but many people want guidance and help with planning too, Frank says.\n\nA lot of the logic can be handled by computers. A lot of the wisdom you can only get from a person, he says.\n\nCollado knows what he means.\n\nI've seen it time and time again, where either someone's been doing their own tax return or they have a friend do it. No one has asked them about being able to set up a Roth IRA. No one's talked to them about what it means to maximize 401(k) contributions. No one is telling them that maybe it's time to make estimated tax payments, she says. Two or three points that they recommend could be life-changing.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nTina Orem is a writer at NerdWallet.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — After three days of backlash from the Kentucky men's basketball team's decision to kneel during the national anthem, coach John Calipari said the timing of the demonstration may not have been wise.\n\nThese kids, they're good kids, Calipari said Tuesday after his team's 85-65 loss to Alabama when asked about the criticism of Saturday's protest. They have good hearts. This political time, probably not a real good time to do it.\n\nCalipari learned his players wanted to kneel during the anthem before Saturday's game at Florida just more than an hour before the game. After explaining their rationale for the demonstration, players asked Calipari and the other Kentucky coaches to kneel with them.\n\nThe staff, including the Hall of Fame head coach, kneeled with players during the anthem, though Calipari did still hold his hand over his heart while the song was played.\n\nResponse to the protest has been mixed, but several of the most negative reactions have come from Kentucky politicians.\n\nThe sheriff and jailer in Laurel County posted a video to Facebook of them burning Kentucky T-shirts. The Knox County Fiscal Court adopted a resolution asking Gov. Andy Beshear and members of the state legislature to reallocate tax funds given to the University of Kentucky in response to the team's protest. Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, delivered an emotional address Monday night on the Senate floor, saying he was hurt by the team's actions because of his family's ties to the military.\n\nHalf of these kids come form military families, Calipari said. ...This had nothing to do with military. They had all the stuff that was going on, and they felt like they needed to do something.\n\nOn his radio show Monday night, Calipari said he told his team it was time to get on with basketball. In the first game since the backlash to the protest started rolling in, Kentucky was blown out by Alabama in a matchup for first place in the Southeastern Conference standings.\n\nYou don't need to speak now, Calipari said he told the team. You need to have action. How do you bring people together? How do you make a difference? Not just, how do you make a statement?\n\nCalipari said the team will work on finding actions to address the issues players knelt to bring awareness to in the wake of the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol, but the next steps likely will not come in front of cameras.\n\nAs has been the case at Rupp Arena all season, Kentucky players were not on the court for the anthem before Tuesday's game against Alabama. Asked for clarification why teams are not on the court for the anthem this year as they had been in previous seasons, a Kentucky spokesman pointed to an offseason SEC rule change eliminating the requirement teams be on the floor for the anthem.\n\nWe reevaluated our pregame routine to fit what worked best for our team, he said.\n\nAsked to clarify if his assessment that the politically charged climate may have made this an inopportune time to kneel meant he thought the protest was a mistake, Calipari said no.\n\nI'm not saying that, he said. It's what they wanted to do. ... They felt the timing was right because of what they're seeing on TV.\n\nFollow Jon Haleon Twitter at @JonHale_CJ.
In his first few days in office, President Joe Biden moved swiftly to deliver on promises to Hispanic voters, signing a directive to protect Dreamers from deportation and unveiling an outline for sweeping changes to immigration laws.\n\nTuesday afternoon, the president announced a task force to reunite families separated at the border and an executive order that reviews a Trump administration policy requiring migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while they plead their case.\n\nBut executive actions are not permanent, and the White House already has begun tamping down hopes for passage of an omnibus reform measure.\n\nThat leaves some Latino advocacy groups looking at an untested fallback plan: a mass presidential pardon for at least some of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.\n\nWe believe this is a viable option if the Senate fails to act on comprehensive immigration reform, said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nReversing Trump:Biden to create task force to reunite families separated at border, sign order to review asylum program\n\nReuniting families:628 parents remain separated from their kids after Trump's zero-tolerance border policy. Biden wants to find them.\n\nHector Sánchez Barba, executive director at Mi Familia Vota,said congressional action is the top priority, and Biden has put forth the most progressive plan I've seen, probably in our history.\n\nBut if Congress fails to reform immigration laws, he said, I am in an action mode. … We will advocate for anything that reverses the extremism and damage of the Trump administration.\n\nIt is unclear how Biden would respond if pressed to pursue a mass pardon. Moreover, not all immigrant-rights advocates want to pursue that controversial path while there is a chance Congress could act.\n\nJorge Loweree, policy director with the American Immigration Council, said a presidential pardon for immigration violators falls short because it wouldn't put people on a path to citizenship; it would just cure one of the barriers to getting there.\n\nThe clemency proposition is not new. In late 2016, before Trump was inaugurated, Garcia and others feared the new president would launch draconian deportations of undocumented immigrants – especially those brought to the United States as children, called Dreamers based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.\n\nDozens of advocacy groups and at least three Democrats in Congress implored then-President Barack Obama to issue last-minute amnesty. In a letter to the president, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and her colleagues described the proposed pardon as a matter of life and death for many of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nObama denied the request. And Trump carried out his promised crackdown.\n\nBiden acts to undo Trump's immigration policies\n\nTrump's promise of a border wall was the hallmark of his first presidential campaign. In office, he tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows people brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country, but he was largely blocked by court rulings. As part of a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, children were separated from parents at the southern border. The administration tried to prevent most migrants from claiming political asylum and required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico.\n\nCut to 2020 and Biden's platform was the polar opposite: He vowed to stop construction of Trump's southern border wall, protect Dreamers and overhaul U.S. immigration laws that have not changed significantlyin three decades.\n\nOn his first day in office, Biden signed an executive memorandum reinstating DACA and unveiled a sweeping immigration reform package.\n\nUnder that proposal, agricultural workers, people who arrived illegally as children and immigrants with what is known as temporary protected status would immediately qualify for green cards – giving them legal status and a right to work. Other undocumented immigrants in the United States as of Jan. 1 would receive temporary legal status for five years, with a path to citizenship if they passed background checks and paid taxes.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who had supported a bipartisan immigration reform plan, ripped Biden's legislative plan as mass amnesty – the exact words used by Trump loyalist Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Democrats who once pushed Obama to pardon Dreamers went silent.\n\nLofgren,a former immigration attorney and the most recent chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, declined to comment on whether she may ask Biden to use his pardon power.\n\nIn a written statement, she said she's focused on working with the president to advance our shared bold vision to reform our country's immigration system.\n\nOther members of the House and Senate did not respond to emails and calls. Neither did a White House spokesman.\n\nA constitutional 'gray area'\n\nOn Jan. 21, 1977, more than 570,000 American offenders were given pardons.\n\nIt was the first full day in office for President Jimmy Carter, and he used it to grant amnesty to Vietnam-era draft dodgers. Nearly 210,000 had been charged with violating the Selective Service Act. Another 360,000 dodged but were not prosecuted.\n\nArticle II, Clause 1 of the Constitution is terse and clear: The President … shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\n\nThe authority covers all violations of federal law and may be used absolutely or conditionally, according to Cornell University Law School's Legal Information Institute. It includes a presumed power to pardon specified classes or communities wholesale, in short, the power to amnesty.\n\nDraft dodgers were nowhere near the first to benefit from mass clemency. Three years earlier, President Gerald Ford granted a conditional pardon to military deserters who were willing to perform public service.\n\nIn fact, presidents throughout history granted amnesty to large groups, beginning with the first pardon issued by George Washington in 1795 to participants in a tax revolt known as the Whiskey Rebellion.\n\nAndrew Johnson gave amnesty to all Confederate soldiers after the Civil War. And, in 1902, Theodore Roosevelt granted amnesty to residents of the Philippines – then a U.S. territory – who took part in an insurrection.\n\nYet, according to legal experts, no president has ever pardoned someone for illegal immigration during the nation's 245-year history. Presidential pardons historically have addressed criminal violations; entering or being in the country unlawfully is a civil offense unless it's a repeat violation.\n\nPeter Markowitz, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, acknowledged it's a legal gray area. But he said immigration violations – civil or criminal – clearly constitute offenses, and there is ample reason to believe it is within a president's pardon authority.\n\nIn a 2017 law review article co-written with Lindsay Nash, Markowitz advocated just such an action, writing: The President possesses the constitutional authority to categorically pardon broad classes of immigrants for civil violations of the immigration laws and to thereby provide durable and permanent protections against deportation.\n\nOther experts say it's not so clear-cut, especially without any Supreme Court precedent on pardons for civil offenses. Some argue that a person in the United States illegally commits an ongoing violation. Pardon power may not be exercised to erase future offenses.\n\nMarkowitz conceded that executive clemency is an imperfect solution because, while it would protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, it would not grant them legal status or rights.\n\nEverybody would prefer that this type of durable protection be delivered through legislation, Markowitz said. But if that proves impossible, clemency at least gives undocumented immigrants peace of mind that they can't be deported.\n\n'We knew what was coming' with Trump\n\nDespite legal uncertainties and a likely political backlash, Markowitz suggested using pardon power for immigrants would have been worth it four years ago.\n\nIn a 2016 opinion piece, Raul A. Reyes, an immigration attorney and member of USA TODAY's board of contributors, argued that by inviting young Dreamers to sign up for DACA, Democrats later exposed them to deportation under the Trump administration.\n\nIt would be a cruel irony if Obama were to turn his back on those here illegally – through no fault of their own – after he helped expose them to risk of deportation, he concluded.\n\nDavid Leopold, immigration counsel for America's Voice, which advocates a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said it made sense to consider amnesty at the close of Obama's presidency because Trump had characterized immigrants as criminals.\n\nWe knew the extremism. We knew the xenophobia. We knew what was coming, said Leopold, who served as a volunteer adviser in the Biden campaign.\n\nBut as Biden's presidency begins, Leopold does not see presidential pardon power as a serious consideration because about 80% of Americans favor changes in law to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nThe answer right now is legislative, Leopold said. There's a moment in history right now when we can do it. … Hopefully, Congress will step up to the plate.\n\nDoris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said it would be a legal and political stretch for Biden to simply pardon people who entered the United States unlawfully – a very out-of-the-blue proposition, as she put it.\n\nI'm just having a hard time figuring out how the pardon power … could be justified for that, said Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nSome say it's not the time to talk pardons\n\nIra Mehlman, media director with the Federation for Immigration Reform, which advocates for strict immigration enforcement and controls, said mass clemency would constitute a huge overreach by the president.\n\nIn a podcast four years ago, he noted, Cecilia Muñoz, then director of the Obama White House's Domestic Policy Council, declared that pardons wouldn't protect a single soul from deportation.\n\nSome immigrant rights advocates also resist talk of amnesty, at least for now, for fear it would undermine the push for legislation.\n\nKristian Ramos of Autonomy Strategies, a communications firm specializing in Latino issues, said Biden's executive order protecting DACA recipients and immigrants in temporary protected status has, for now, solved the most pressing problem.\n\nThey're protected, Ramos said. He has essentially provided the … reprieve that he could. There's no real need to pardon them.\n\nJuliana Macedo do Nascimento, a DACA recipient from Brazil and policy manager with United We Dream, declined to address the amnesty question in a written statement.\n\nInstead, she stressed that Biden and Democrats have a mandate from the people to transform America's immigration system. President Biden must use every tool at his disposal to provide relief for as many people as possible, she said.\n\nWe are tired and not satisfied by executive actions, said Fernando Garcia, executive director with Border Network for Human Rights. We need to actually change the law.\n\nGarcia expressed doubt that Biden would consider amnesty even if legislation fails. I don't think it's realistic that any president is going to say, 'We're going to pardon 600,000 Dreamers or 1.2 million Dreamers,' he said. And I don't believe Dreamers are guilty of any offense.\n\nLoweree, with the American Immigration Council, said America's support for Dreamers is higher than ever, and the president has a unique opportunity to fulfill campaign promises beginning with announcements Tuesday.\n\nLoweree said he doesn't buy into claims that Biden has a debt to Hispanics who helped him get elected. The issue here isn't who owes anyone anything, he said. Rather, it's about fulfilling a promise made during the Obama administration: 'Dreamers' who came out of the shadows and signed up for DACA were told they'd be protected and allowed to work, not deported.\n\nWith that in mind, Loweree suggested talk of presidential amnesty cannot be dismissed entirely: We expect President Biden will do everything in his power – and consider all options.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday granted Greenville-based Miracle Hill Ministries an exemption to continue its faith-based foster care program that works only with Christians.\n\nMiracle Hill has been operating its program for decades, but its recruiting policy came under scrutiny after the Obama administration implemented a new regulation for federal funding recipients shortly before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The regulation prohibits groups receiving federal funding from discriminating on the basis of religion.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster had requested an exemption on Miracle Hill's behalf in March 2018, and the issue became the focus of a national discussion on religious freedom as the ministry waited on a decision from the federal government.\n\nThe Administration for Children and Families, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, granted the exemption Wednesday to protect the religious liberty of all faith-based foster care providers in South Carolina.\n\nIt protects minors who are in need of as many options as possible for being placed in loving foster families, Lynn Johnson, assistant secretary for the Administration of Children and Families, said in a statement. The government should not be in the business of forcing foster care providers to close their doors because of their faith. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right.\n\nMiracle Hill, the largest provider of foster families in South Carolina for foster children who do not have significant special needs, does not allow gay couples or families that don't agree with its statement of faith to serve as foster parents through its program. However, it does direct those of different beliefs to other foster care programs.\n\nWithin the past 10 months, Miracle Hill Ministries and its board members have been the target of hate mail and hate calls. Someone even threatened to burn down the organization's building, Miracle Hill President and CEO Reid Lehman said.\n\nHe said he felt a mixture of relief and joy when he learned of the decision.\n\nIt was the right decision to honor the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he said. It was the right decision to keep the pool of providers for foster care as big as possible, and the right decision to make sure the needs of South Carolina children are met.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union disagreed with the federal government's decision and considered it to be discrimination. Eight states have passed laws allowing state-contracted child agencies to exclude prospective families based on the religious beliefs of the agency, the ACLU said.\n\nThis is the first action by the federal government to sanction such discrimination, the ACLU said.\n\nThere are more than 400,000 children in foster care around the country, and today the Trump administration has turned its back on each of them, said Leslie Cooper, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project.\n\nProspective foster and adoptive parents should be judged only on their capacity to provide love and support to a child – not their faith, Cooper said.\n\nMore:ACLU sues Michigan over religious exemptions for adoptions\n\nMore:Reaction to Supreme Court same-sex wedding cake verdict: 'Huge win for religious freedom'\n\nCongressman Jeff Duncan said the decision is a big win for religious liberty, particularly for organizations in South Carolina who provide faith-based services.\n\nI have been working on this issue for over two years now, and I am happy to see the Administration protect religious liberty and the children and families who rely on these services in the Upstate, Duncan said.\n\nFaith-based foster and adoption services perform amazing work for communities in South Carolina and around the country, he said. These organizations care deeply about children and families in need, and they shouldn't be punished by the federal government because of their faith.\n\nMiracle Hill Ministries is the Upstate's largest, most comprehensive provider of services to homeless children and adults, its website said.\n\nSince its start in 1937, the organization has served with programs that include rescue shelters for the homeless, residential addiction recovery, transitional housing, and shelters for children.\n\nWe're clear in our identity, Lehman told The Greenville News. We look like a social service agency, but we're a community of Christ followers and our faith in Christ is the most important part of who we are.\n\nIt's important for Miracle Hill to partner with Christians in achieving its mission of serving the poor and especially children in the name of Christ, Lehman said.\n\nIf we had to choose between compromising our spiritual beliefs or not providing these services we would hold fast to our spiritual beliefs, he said.\n\nLehman said it has been argued that the pool of foster care families is reduced or restricted because Miracle Hill recruits just Christian families. Lehman said Miracle Hill would never deny a healthy person the chance to work with a child.\n\nLehman said that anyone in the state who wants to foster has a choice of other agencies they could foster with, as well as with DSS.\n\nIf anyone – Jewish, Muslim, atheist, any religion or no religion said 'I want to foster a child' and they looked like a healthy person, we would try to help them find someone to take them through the licensing process because kids need it, he said.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said HHS's decision is shameful, illegal and immoral, and that it allows a government funded foster care agency to openly discriminate against Jews, gay couples and others who don't follow their faith.\n\nAllowing a taxpayer-funded agency to discriminate against Jews and other minorities is outrageous and sets a dangerous precedent for our nation. This is clearly unlawful and will not hold up in court, said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nMost of Miracle Hill's existence comes from donations, Lehman said. But some of the funds it receives from the state DSS for reimbursements – about $600,000 a year – comes from the federal sources, Lehman said.\n\nAmanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, said the committee opposes government-funded religious discrimination, and said the action by HHS signals a dramatic and troubling shift.\n\nThis waiver shows more concern for the providers than children in need and willing foster parents, Tyler said.\n\nMiracle Hill recruits families for foster children, but it doesn't actually place them in the homes of its families. That's the role and decision of the state Department of Social Services, said Sandra Furnell, spokesperson for Miracle Hill.\n\nWhen DSS comes to Miracle Hill and says, 'We have this child. Do you have a home that would take this child?,' we look among the people we have, Furnell said.\n\nIf we have a family willing and able to receive that child, DSS makes that decision whether or not to place a child with our families, she said. We don't have the authority to place those children.\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn, U.S. House Majority Whip, is among the key house Democrats that issued a joint response condemning the waiver.\n\nI have stood against discrimination my entire career, and this waiver is unlawful discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, Clyburn said. The real tragedy of this situation is that federal funding is being used to keep children out of loving homes.\n\nRep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., ) said the decision is morally wrong, unconstitutional, and sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\nMore importantly, we should not be in the position of denying families that want to help vulnerable children based on criteria that in no way impacts their ability to be a loving parent or mentor, he said.\n\nThe decision suggests that it is not the children, but the social welfare agencies themselves, who require protection, said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., lead House Democratic sponsor of the Every Child Deserves a Family Act and member of the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal policy with respect to tax-exempt organizations and child welfare.\n\nIt is remarkable to me that making it easy for agencies in South Carolina to discriminate against adoptive or foster parents comes so easily to this administration, yet the emergency facing millions of vulnerable orphan or foster children falls on deaf ears, he said.\n\nOur state foster care system is facing many challenges recruiting loving and competent families, said Sue Berkowitz, director of SC Appleseed Legal Justice Center.\n\nAllowing caring families to be discriminated against and denied the opportunity to become a foster home hurts the very children our state is charged to protect and should not be allowed.\n\nThe Charleston Jewish Federation is dismayed to learn of the exemption, said Eileen Chepenik, president and Judi Corsaro, CEO of the federation. Jeff Ayers, executive director of SC Equality in a joint statement.\n\nThis flies in the face of the first amendment to our nation's constitution, they said. As Jews, we believe in Tikkun Olam, repair of the world, and support children's welfare, whatever an adopting family's religion, race, or sexual orientation.\n\n As Americans, we must work to fight against any form of discrimination that marginalizes individuals at the hands of government-funded dollars, said Jeff Ayers, executive director of SC Equality. Right now there are children in South Carolina who could be living in stable, loving homes, with parents who just happen to be LGBT. It's disgraceful that an agency working to provide suitable homes for children would deny then access to a bright future.\n\nColleen Condon, president of AFFA (Alliance for Full Acceptance) and a family law attorney in Charleston, said they are so disappointed that the federal government has granted an exemption allowing religious discrimination in adoptions.\n\nAFFA advocates for social justice for gay parents. And I work with wonderful parents seeking to care for a child who otherwise will be left in the tentative world of foster care and group homes. We will not let this stand.\n\nFederal law prohibits discrimination in federally-funded programs against foster parents on religious grounds, but 10 states permit discrimination by state-licensed foster care organizations against LGBTQ people, same-sex couples and others if doing so conflicts with the organization's beliefs, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) said in a release Thursday.\n\nThis waiver is unconscionable, in no small part because it prioritizes federal contractors over kids in need of families, said Cathryn Oakley, HRC state legislative director and senior counsel.\n\nFollow Angelia Davis on Twitter: @NewsAngelia
Sarah Skidmore Sell\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nTax season is here, and while you have until April 18 to file your return, you may want to think about doing so sooner rather than later. Here are a few expert tips on why:\n\nIDENTITY THEFT\n\nFiling early essentially beats criminals to the punch.\n\nIdentity theft is a growing problem and one often tied to tax refund fraud, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Once your return is filed with the IRS, the information — in particular your social security number — is locked and cannot be used again by anyone else.\n\nSteber suggests filing early to secure the information and your refund. It's one of the easiest forms of identity protection.\n\nTax news and advice\n\nFASTER RETURNS\n\nIf you're due a tax refund, the sooner you file the sooner you'll get it.\n\nLisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and TurboTax expert, said that last tax season close to three out of four tax filers received a tax refund, and the average refund was about $2,800. That's a big boost to many households.\n\nWhile some delays are expected this year for filers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS still expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds in under three weeks from the day a return is received.\n\nBETTER PREPARATION\n\nFiling early gives you time to more carefully prepare your returns.\n\nPeople who wait until the last minute may forget something in their rush, Greene-Lewis said. Starting earlier gives you more time to gather your paperwork and seek help if needed.\n\nYou should have received most of your tax paperwork by Jan. 31.\n\nIf you owe money, filing early gives you more time to save up the cash, as your bill isn't due until April 18th.\n\nThe bulk of taxpayers are not procrastinators, Greene-Lewis said. About 20 percent file in the last two weeks before the deadline, and another 10 to 12 percent pay later, but the majority file earlier. She pointed out that with all the improvements in tax filing software and support available, there are few excuses to delay.
WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown is now the longest in American history.\n\nThe shutdown entered its 22nd day on Saturday, surpassing the previous 21-day record set in late 1995 and early 1996 during the Clinton administration.\n\nNine federal departments and several smaller agencies – one-fourth of the federal government – remain closed as the standoff barrels into its fourth week with no end in sight.\n\nMembers of the House and the Senate both went home to their districts on Friday and won't return until Monday, guaranteeing that parts of the government will remain closed at least through early next week.\n\nHere's what to know about the situation.\n\nWhen will it end?\n\nHard to say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the White House and congressional Democrats over border wall funding.\n\nBut exactly when Trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.\n\nTrump suggested during a trip to the border in Texas on Thursday that an emergency declaration could come at any time if negotiations with Democrats fail to yield a deal on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding.\n\nBut Trump played down the prospects of an imminent emergency declaration on Friday, saying he wasn't going to do it so fast.\n\nA sign that he's serious about declaring an emergency: The Pentagon is already preparing options to build barriers along the southern border if Trump does declare a national emergency there. An emergency declaration would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to design barriers and allow contracts to build them.\n\nAn emergency declaration by Trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. But it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.\n\nMore:Donald Trump makes several misstatements during tour of U.S.-Mexico border in Texas\n\nWhat has been the impact?\n\nThe shutdown has rippled across the country since it started Dec. 22.\n\nOn Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The employees have been forced to take unpaid leave or work without pay, leaving many wondering how they will pay their mortgage or rent, make car payments and make ends meet. Some businesses have resorted to offering furlough freebies, such as free meals and restaurant discounts, to tide the displaced workers over until their next check.\n\nTourists in the nation's capital have been forced to come up with alternative itineraries as a result of the shutdown. Popular tourist attractions like the National Zoo, the Smithsonian museums and national monuments are all closed.\n\nNational parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. The National Park Service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. But many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.\n\nVandalism also has been a problem. At Joshua Tree National Park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern California park by cutting down several Joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.\n\nAir travel has been hampered by the shutdown. Aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. Miami International Airport is closing one of its terminals Saturday through Monday because many Transportation Security Administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.\n\nThe shutdown is even causing reverberations in space. Repairs to the main camera on the Hubble Space Telescope have been delayed because of agency closures.\n\nMore:Government shutdown: How it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer\n\nHow have other shutdowns ended?\n\nBefore the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. The lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nIn 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when Democratic President Jimmy Carter found himself at odds with Congress even though Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. Carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. Funding for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving Medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nThat shutdown finally ended when Carter managed to get the projects he opposed stripped from the legislation, and the House and Senate passed a bill that expanded the exceptions to the Medicaid abortion ban to include rape and incest.\n\nA 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Unable to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law, Republicans in Congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY reporters Tom Vanden Brook, Ledyard King, Bill Theobald, Kelly Tyko and Ben Mutzabaugh; and reporters Shane Newell and Colin Atagi of the Desert Sun.
Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nIf President Donald Trump loses in 2020 (and it is by no means certain that he will), his defeat will come at the hands of a coalition led by the Democratic Party that will be composed, in the main, of energized and angry Democrats. In swing states, they could get the support of a small but important cadre of independents and surburbanites who tended to vote Republican in the past, and an even smaller handful of disaffected former Republicans for whom tax cuts and judges were not enough to keep them in their party.\n\nIf this happens, it will be a hopeful sign (along with the centrist Democratic victories in 2018) of an emerging truce among various partisans of both the right and left. It will show that Americans can put political differences aside when faced with the kind of threat Trump poses to our values and our Constitution itself.\n\nCan such a truce last? Can a center hold? For those of us exhausted both by Trump and by years of polarized infighting — and I am first among partisan sinners on that score — 2020 seems to hold out the promise of reconciliation. If we start from a basic respect for the Constitution and a commitment to rule of law, why can't we work out almost everything else?\n\nWe can agree to preserve democracy\n\nI feel this hope keenly myself. I am a former Republican who has already crossed over and publicly vowed to support the Democratic nominee in 2020, no matter who it is, in order to help end this nightmare. I have shared a political foxhole with people I once criticized, and I can never be as partisan as I once was.\n\nEven so, the idea of a lasting post-Trump coalition is probably too optimistic. There will be no magical consensus on abortion or guns or immigration on Nov. 4. But we can save the constitutional mechanisms that allow us to keep fighting over such things while preserving our commitment to an open democracy. Given how low we have fallen under Trump, that would itself be an achievement.\n\nWhether we can turn the defeat of Trump into a real American reconciliation, however, is at this point completely in the hands of the Democratic Party. What happens after November depends on who the Democrats nominate and how the victor governs.\n\nDemocrats will complain that this is horribly unfair. Republicans got us into this mess, they will object, and it is not up to Democrats to get us out of it. They are not wrong. But life is not fair, and dealing with reality is always better than wishing.\n\nAnd here's the most important reality: The Republican Party has been mainlining the pure, uncut narcotic of irrational rage for years now, and Republicans are not going to quit cold turkey. There will be no moment of clarity. Most of them are older people who will take this addiction to their graves.\n\nRealism before next fall should also lead to some stock-taking among Democrats. They have long pursued a strategy of narrow division along identity lines that produced big wins for some Democrats in reliably blue states while leaving 1,000 offices across the land in the hands of Republicans and keeping the Electoral College competitive for the GOP. As Columbia professor (and avowed liberal) Mark Lilla once wrote, Democrats became obsessed with the national media and the presidency rather than the daily task of winning over people at the local level.\n\nGOP politics of chaos:From Scott Brown to Donald Trump, can Democrats recover from the traumas of the 2010s?\n\nIncredibly, some Democrats are so convinced that a Progressive Promised Land is now in sight that they have even taken to criticizing the legacy of President Barack Obama, the man who saved them from the wilderness. For all their talk of how hard it will be to beat Trump, they seem convinced that 2020 will vindicate the ideologues of 1968, avenge the losses of the 1980s and repudiate the GOP advances of the 2000s.\n\nNone of that is going to happen.\n\nThink about defeating the next Trump\n\nSome Democrats will argue that this is just a plea to pick a pseudo-Republican. This is childish. I accept that elections have consequences, and I know what I will get with any Democratic president. Even as a Republican, I never argued for incessant warfare against Obama, whom I supported on any number of issues ranging from missile defense to Cuba. I opposed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denying the president's constitutional right to a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office.\n\nBut I am not the voter Democrats need. They already have me. Not only am I on board for 2020, but I have also decided never to vote for anyone who enabled Trump in any way, so I could be walking alongside the Democrats a lot longer, into 2024 and for many years beyond (God willing).\n\nCrossing the line:Why this Never Trump ex-Republican will vote for almost any 2020 Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democrats, however, must think about defeating not only Trump but also the next Trump. There are plenty of GOP opportunists who are waiting to capture that national populist mantle, and it comes with a built-in reservoir of votes. To build a resilient consensus, the Democrats need to govern, instead of trying to outbid the GOP in the culture war, a game at which Republicans will always be better.\n\nIf the victor in 2020 is someone like former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, there is a chance that the Democrats can build a durable coalition that will hold off the next Trump.\n\nIf the winner is someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, she also could unify the country if she chooses to govern and heal rather than to engage in doomed and demonstrative politics. But if Warren shows up on her first day and tries to eliminate private health insurance while asking a preteen transgender child what he thinks of her Cabinet picks, the post-Trump Era of Good Feeling will be measured in minutes or hours rather than months or years.\n\nThe Democrats now have a historic opportunity. They can preside over a new majority without ditching their principles or abandoning the groups that have come to rely on them — rightly — for protection from howling mobs of people in red hats who think socialism lurks around every corner.\n\nWill they take it?\n\nTom Nichols is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.

San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams says significant risks to the economy have faded for the first time since the recession and stronger growth could force the Fed to raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated.\n\nIn a recent interview, Williams, who Trump is considering as vice chairman of the Fed's board, said he's comfortable with Fed policymakers' median forecast of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018. But he believes there's a greater chance of faster growth and inflation prompting four rate increases than of slower gains forcing a pullback to two bumps.\n\nThere is some potential the economy is going to outperform my forecast, he said. I'm not really worried about the economy stalling, which was a concern a few years ago.\n\nMore:How the Fed interest rate hike could affect your wallet\n\nMore:Fed raises rates, keeps forecast for 3 hikes in 2018\n\nMore:Tax cuts: Economists see modest impact on workers, economy as corporate taxes fall\n\nBarring a downturn in the economy's performance over the next two months, he said it appears likely the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term rate in March, as markets anticipate, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. But he stressed that economic data in coming weeks will guide the Fed's decision.\n\nWilliams also said he believes the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump last month will boost the economy modestly and won't crimp growth in a couple of years by swelling the deficit and pushing up borrowing costs. That sanguine view contrasts with many economists' forecasts that the tax overhaul will serve as a drag on growth as soon as 2020.\n\nWilliams' outlook is noteworthy not only because he may take the Fed's No 2. role. He's also considered a centrist who has voted in lockstep with both outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat, and Republican Fed Governor Jerome Powell. Powell is scheduled to take the Fed's reins from Yellen next month after his expected Senate confirmation. Williams, who was Yellen's research director when she headed the San Francisco Fed, will be a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year.\n\nNot long ago, Fed officials worried that hiking rates at even a moderate pace could derail a fragile recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. But Williams cited the current confluence of positive economic forces, including a resurgent global economy, strong consumer and business confidence, record stock prices and the Republican tax cuts.\n\nI think the economy has very solid momentum, he said.\n\nSpeed bumps ahead?\n\nNot that the economy doesn't face speed bumps that continue to restrain growth. Those include vestiges of the recession, such as cautious lenders, fewer business startups and millions of prime-age men who remain outside the labor force. Those scars are probably going to be with us for the foreseeable future, Williams said. He also highlights long-term challenges such as an aging population and sluggish gains in productivity, or worker output.\n\nThe tax cuts, he projects, will result in a little bit faster growth, adding about a quarter percentage point a year for the next three years, largely by spurring businesses to increase investment and become more productive. By lowering individual tax rates, he said the plan also could draw some Americans back into the workforce, adding as much as another percentage point to economic output over a decade.\n\nStill, Williams said, We don't need a stimulus right now in terms of short-run growth.\n\nAt the same time, he disagrees with economists who believe the benefits of the tax overhaul will be offset by a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion rise in the federal deficit that will drive up long-term interest rates and discourage borrowing and economic activity.\n\nBecause of the size of the tax cuts, there's not going to be dramatically higher interest rates, he says. He expects the added debt will increase long-term rates by about a quarter percentage point over the next few years. Williams forecasts economic growth of about 2.5% both in 2017 and this year, 2% in 2019 and a slowdown to 1¾% over five years. The economy has expanded at a tepid 2.1% average pace during the recovery. Trump has vowed his agenda of lower taxes and fewer regulations will deliver 3% growth.\n\nWilliams also downplays fears that the economic stimulus from the tax overhaul will lead to an excessive run-up in wage growth and inflation, especially with the 4.1% unemployment rate already sparking worker shortages. He points to long-term factors that have suppressed consumer price increases, such as slower-growing health care costs due to reduced government spending on Medicare.\n\nI'm not really worried about inflation taking off, he says.\n\nSlow wage growth, inflation\n\nIn fact, many economists have been puzzled that average annual wage growth has been stuck at about 2.5% the past couple of years despite the low jobless rate. But Williams said it wasn't until last year that the economy strengthened and unemployment fell below a normal 4.7%, increasing the competition for workers.\n\n I expect upward pressure on wages to really show up in 2018 and 2019, he said. He foresees pay increases approaching 3% by the end of the year.\n\nThat, he says, should help nudge the Fed's preferred measure of annual inflation from 1.5% toward its 2% target over the next two years. Williams is among Fed officials who have recently argued the central bank should consider letting inflation exceed its 2% benchmark for a period to make up for undershoots during and after the recession.\n\nYet while he isn't worried about a spike in inflation in the near term, he says gradual rate hikes would be the right thing to do to ward off such a scenario. I think that waiting too long could actually create some risk down the road that the economy does overheat, he says. I want to see this expansion continue as long as possible.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation's first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI's National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War's aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery's role in fueling a civil rights movement. It'll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state's funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university's most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. Several horses died due to bullet wounds, but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state's aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year's springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don't have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn't know about all the money state departments take in that isn't reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. I'd like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion, Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school's Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot highly offensive. Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware, says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year's protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn't there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that, Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women's March organizers. Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don't go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a guarantor for the state's election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state's outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can't be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy, Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller's nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation's sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department's director says the state is at a critical juncture, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho's expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city's grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana's first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn't meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church's Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn't have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured, Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the Queen of Funk on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That's pretty cool, said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single I Feel For You. Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the fiscally responsible thing to do, Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. Criminal-justice reform isn't just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it's the moral thing to do, he told reporters at the Capitol. It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state's attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that, Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It's not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride. The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building's exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse. The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore, his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do, said Kirby, 54. This is going to help them. I'm so happy for them. The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state's voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won't be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It's Minnesota's first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state's major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state's U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what's the only state test not required by federal law. It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment, Mississippi Professional Educators, the state's largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor's lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's federal lawsuit accusing entrenched interests of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department's long history of racial discrimination. She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents' basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL's Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university's students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it's the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it's quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. Reno cares about our animals, Newby says. They need protection and don't need to become a punchline.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims' names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents' plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They're aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare. New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone of the Southwest has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of extremophile algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city's so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four immigration subpoenas for information about inmates wanted for deportation. This is not a request – it's a demand, Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America, spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency's mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation detainers or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota's workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the Freedom Riders who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state's changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That's making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife, said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. We've been working on trying to address these impacts. For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department's conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf's administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections' officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania's 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state's annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it's important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman's Mall have been cut down. They'll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall's, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult's latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn't know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult's 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee's office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn't like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city's three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain's 500th anniversary of the Voyage to the New World celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state's registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March's Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don't request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it's too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state's nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor's Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak's Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday's rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia's solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified credible evidence that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a violent insurrection. Online, threats of violence have been rampant among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site, the tribe's Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it's just unbelievable. The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as Medical Seat Belt Safety Days, the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer's Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It's still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable, Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Kristan Hawkins\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn the same month in which hundreds of thousands will come to Washington D.C. to March for Life in sad memorial of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that created a legal right to abortion, the justices may take up a case that gives them the chance to reconsider. Vice President Mike Pence cracked the door to that possibility in 2016 with the stroke of a pen in defense of women in a unique #MeToo moment.\n\nPence was governor of Indiana when legislation was sent to his desk that prohibited doctors from discriminating against persons in the womb by aborting solely on the basis of sex, race or disability of the infant. The law also required that after an abortion took place, the broken bodies would be humanely handled by cremation or burial, rather than burned for fuel or dumped into landfills.\n\nThe case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, presents an interesting dilemma for the abortion industry, which actively opposes a review by the high court. In fact, last month the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky argued that the Supreme Court should reject the petition filed by the state.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTwitter feigns political neutrality, but my pro-life organization sees the bias firsthand\n\nAbortion rights advocates don't speak for all women on Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination\n\nOn the brink of a post-Roe world, pro-life movement needs a future beyond abortion\n\nWhy? Because the reason for abortion should not matter, they said, adding it would be perverse to be allowed to abort healthy babies but not unhealthy babies.\n\nBut perhaps their objection came from a desire to avoid a public relations reality — that most people recoil from discrimination and callous treatment of others based on prejudice or perceptions of their worth or ability.\n\nIn fact, in a poll just released by Students for Life of America's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement from the polling company, inc./WomanTrend, we found that 54 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed abortion as a form of contraception or when a mother doesn't like the sex of the baby.\n\nObjecting to this isn't rhetorical or theoretical. Actual people are impacted.\n\nAbortion impacts women, racial minorities\n\nConsider the abortion rate of those judged less than perfect who face discrimination in the womb because of perceptions of their abilities. With the rise of prenatal testing, many babies never draw a breath after their parents get a difficult test result. Data indicates that 67 percent of babies that are determined to have Down syndrome are aborted. Two of my four children have cystic fibrosis, and I can tell you that there is tremendous pressure put on mothers like me to abort, as though a life is only worth living when others decide that you will earn more in your lifetime than you cost.\n\nConsider the ultimate #MeToo reality of abortion's impact on preborn girls. The United Nations Population Fund reports that since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 percent more male births than female births with projections that by 2020, more than 142 million women and girls will be lost to gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination.\n\nAnd consider the experience of certain races and abortion. For example, African-American columnist Jason Riley at the Wall Street Journal has observed that more African-American babies are aborted than born alive in New York City, a tragedy that demands consideration, there and elsewhere as African-American women have the highest abortion rate of any other demographic. Looking at perceptions of black genocide through abortion, award-winning filmmaker Yoruba Richen in her PBS documentary Anti-abortion Crusaders: Inside the African-American Abortion Battle noted that for anti-abortion activists in the black community [t]he centerpiece of their message [is] 'The most dangerous place for an African-American child is in the womb.'\n\nMost millennials support limits on abortion\n\nWith that in mind, it's no surprise that Pence supported the life-affirming law as well as other policies designed to show respect to the people impacted by abortion. Our poll found that 7 of 10 millennials — projected to be the largest voting bloc in America — support limits on abortion, and that 65 percent would like to vote on the abortion issue, something that can happen when Roe is reversed and questions of abortion policy are returned to the states.\n\nIn fact, only 7 percent of those surveyed supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars, the Democratic Party platform and the often-asserted viewpoint of this generation whom I have found to be much more nuanced in their views. In working with college, university and high school groups on more than 1,220 campuses in all 50 states, I know that this generation is motivated to help women and their preborn children, viewing abortion as a human rights concern.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. As the Supreme Court decides whether to review this case, the real question is how best to treat the least of these and whether discrimination against those in the womb represents our American ideals.\n\nKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America, with more than 1,220 groups on college, university and high school campuses in all 50 states.

Rep. Steve King, who has long courted controversy, has now courted a new opponent: a prominent Republican challenger will vie against him in 2020.\n\nIowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who helped lead an effort last year to approve massive tax cuts in Iowa, said Wednesday that he'll seek the GOP nomination for King's 4th Congressional District. King won re-election two months ago, after an unusually close race for the longtime House member.\n\nFeenstra did not mention King by name in his emailed announcement, but tacitly acknowledged the staunch conservative member of Congress, who's made offensive remarks on immigration, multiculturalism and other issues. King has previously dismissed the criticism.\n\nToday, Iowa's 4th District doesn't have a voice in Washington, because our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table, Feenstra said in a statement. We don't need any more sideshows or distractions, we need to start winning for Iowa's families.\n\nKing says Feenstra is 'easily swayed by the left'\n\nKing has not indicated publicly whether he'll seek re-election in 2020, but he didn't hold back his feelings about Feenstra's run. An emailed statement sent by Jeff King, the congressman's son and employee, began by claiming that Feenstra told Jeff King in late December that he would never run against the elder King.\n\nSteve King's statement added: Today, misguided political opportunism, fueled by establishment puppeteers, has revealed that Mr. Feenstra is easily swayed by the lies of the left.\n\nKing has faced other primary challengers since getting elected to the northwest district in 2002. King noted that history in his statement, calling Feenstra's bid an attempt by the establishment in as many primary cycles to take the 4th District out of the hands of grassroots Republicans.\n\nKing's statement, which highlights that President Donald Trump has called the congressman the world's most conservative human being, concludes that Feenstra offers Republican voters nothing but warmed over talking points from liberal blogs and failed Democratic candidates.\n\nRepublican officials don't promise to support King\n\nBut Feenstra's announcement could be the beginning of a serious political fight for King. Feenstra has hired consultant Matt Leopold to help run his campaign. Leopold served as political director on Gov. Kim Reynolds' recent gubernatorial campaign during the primary.\n\nReynolds — who named King as a campaign co-chair during her election — would not endorse King during an interview Wednesday with a local television station. She said she wouldn't weigh in on a primary.\n\nThe last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close, she told WHO-TV. That indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that.\n\nReynolds was referencing the fact that while the congressman was able to fend off an election challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten, it was his closest race since his first election.\n\nNov. 6 appears to have put King on defense. He announced earlier this month that he will hold town halls in every county in his northwest district, a change from recent years.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley was noncommittal on Wednesday about his thoughts on Feenstra or any other primary challenger.\n\nIt's very rare for me to get involved in a primary, so any Iowan in office today where I say, 'I'm not getting involved in a primary,' they shouldn't take it personal, the Republican senator said.\n\nJeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, offered a similar response in a statement: As we are in all legitimate primary contests, the Republican Party of Iowa will remain neutral in this race. The good people of the fourth district will have the ultimate say.\n\nDemocrats don't like King or Feenstra\n\nIowa Democrats don't like King or Feenstra. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price said in a statement: The 4th District deserves a public servant who will put the people's interests ahead of political ambitions, but, unfortunately, that's not Sen. Feenstra.\n\nIn Feenstra's announcement, he expressed wanting to provide Trump with a strong voice who can help protect and advance a conservative agenda for America.\n\nFeenstra was critical of Democrats with their new majority in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in the midst of negotiations with legislative leaders and Trump to end a partial government shutdown over immigration that's stretched into more than two weeks. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. Democrats do not support that funding, in part by noting that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for such a structure.\n\nWhat we've seen this past week from the new Democratic majority in Congress is appalling. ... The President needs effective conservative leaders in Congress who will not only support his agenda, but actually get things done, Feenstra said.\n\nFeenstra was elected to the Iowa Senate in 2008. He is currently the head of the powerful tax-writing Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Another potential problem caused by the government shutdown: a backlog of beer.\n\nThat's what led Washington D.C. brewery Atlas Brew Works to file a lawsuit against the federal government this week, saying the shutdown is preventing it from shipping new beers.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Atlas Brew Works applied for a new keg label for a beer called The Precious One, an apricot-infused IPA, set to be available in February. It had already received a label approval for the beer in cans.\n\nBut because of the shutdown, the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has not been issuing new labels. Stuck in the backlog: five labels from Atlas, including for The Precious One.\n\nMore:Government shutdown: How it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer\n\nIf Atlas cannot get an approved label, making it legal to ship the beer to Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee, the brewery could lose $15,000 and see its continued existence threatened, because the lack of new approved labels effectively shuts down further production of new beers and the rebranding of existing beers, the brewery wrote in its complaint filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the complaint, Atlas charged being prevented from getting new labels is an infringement on its freedom of speech. And even though the government may shut down, the First Amendment never shuts down, the brewery said.\n\nBecause the government is not issuing new labels, Atlas cannot legally comply with the law, it says. However, the right to free speech is not a favor that the government affords Americans when political circumstances allow, the complaint said.\n\nAtlas Brew Works is seeking an injunction to prevent acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker from enforcing labeling laws against the brewery.\n\nThe government is expected to file a response Friday. A hearing on the case is scheduled Tuesday.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.
The New York Mets' offseason to-do list included adding a power bat.\n\nWell, just days after signing free agent slugger Jay Bruce, the Mets also added veteran Adrian Gonzalez, according to a baseball official with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe official spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized.\n\nGonzalez, 35, was traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Atlanta Braves as part of a five-man deal in December driven mainly by luxury tax considerations. After the trade, the Braves designated Gonzalez for assignment.\n\nA-Gone has 311 career home runs but has seen a decline over the past several seasons in his power numbers, questioning if he would retire after the season. He missed nearly half of the 2017 due to injuries, which also saw the rise of rookie Cody Bellinger. He had a slashing line of .242/.287/.355 with three home runs in 71 games and did not appear on the Dodgers postseason roster.\n\nGonzalez gives the Mets insurance in case rookie Dominic Smith is not ready to be the everyday starting first baseman.\n\nThe Mets get Gonzalez at the league minimum salary of $545,000 in 2018. The Braves are responsible for the $21.5 million owed to him for the 2018 season under his previous contract.\n\nGallery: Notable 2017-18 offseason trades
Barbara Marquand\n\nNerdWallet\n\nOnce the optimistic glow surrounding New Year's financial resolutions wears off — hello, February! — it's time to roll up your sleeves before losing momentum altogether.\n\nWhether you aim to save money or get stuff organized, many apps and websites are available to help. Here are some things you can do, along with a few caveats.\n\nShow proof of car insurance (and file claims)\n\nMany insurers offer apps that let you pay bills, access policy information and file claims. Your insurer may have an app to help you prove you have car insurance during a traffic stop, avoiding a frantic search through the glove compartment. Unless you're a driver in Connecticut, New Mexico or D.C. (or your state doesn't require insurance or ID cards), you can show insurance ID on your phone, according to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\n\nThe caveat: Keep the paper card in the glove compartment as a backup in case someone else drives the car or you leave your phone behind.\n\nComplete a home inventory\n\nIf a fire destroys your house, imagine listing from memory every item you lost in order to make an insurance claim. That would be tough on a good day. After a disaster, it's a nightmare, says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nI think the brain tries to protect you from the sadness of things you lost, making it harder to remember, she says. Apps such as United Policyholders' UPHelp Home Inventory and the Insurance Information Institute's Know Your Stuff guide you through documenting all your belongings. Proper documentation is a key to getting reimbursed fully by the insurance company. Your homeowners insurance company might offer an inventory app, too.\n\nThe caveat: Remember to update the inventory when you get new stuff.\n\nArchive important documents\n\nCompanies such as Estate Map, Everplans and My Life & Wishes let you digitally store documents, life insurance policy information and instructions for loved ones to access after your death. It's vital to keep information securely stored and let those who need access know how to find it.\n\nThe caveat: Some similar companies have already come and gone. Keep a backup paper file, and let your loved ones know how to find it.\n\nCreate legal documents\n\nOnline legal sites such as LegalZoom, Nolo and Rocket Lawyer provide do-it-yourself tools to create end-of-life planning documents, including wills, powers of attorney and health directives. Pricing is cheap, starting at under $100 for a simple will.\n\nThe caveat: Walk very, very carefully with online legal solutions, says Lawrence Lehmann, an immediate past president of the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils. He advises talking to an estate attorney or, if you can't afford one, seeking help through a low-cost legal aid clinic. These are powerful documents, and there are plenty of opportunities for missteps, which could wreak havoc later. The devil is in the details, he says.\n\nFor example, Louisiana law says you must sign every page of your notarial (typewritten vs. handwritten) will in front of a notary and two witnesses, among other rules. If you don't, the will is unenforceable.\n\nTrack spending, save money\n\nA variety of free and low-cost apps helps you budget and save:\n\nIntuit's Mint lets you link bank accounts, credit cards and bills and then shows where money is going and how to save.\n\nGoodbudget lets you set aside money upfront in digital envelopes, or categories, and tracks spending.\n\nAcorns rounds up to the next dollar your credit and debit card purchases and invests the change in a diversified portfolio.\n\nMint and Goodbudget offer free versions; Acorns charges $1 a month or 0.25% per year for accounts of $5,000 or more, but is free for college students.\n\nThe caveat: Understand how the fees work or, if the app is free, how the company makes money. Some of these apps might be right for you, but evaluate them objectively.\n\nApps can help you meet personal finance goals, but they can't do everything. Make sure you address big priorities, such as setting money aside in tax-advantaged retirement accounts and getting the right insurance coverage.\n\nMORE: Best budgeting and saving tools\n\nMORE: How to save on car insurance\n\nMORE: The best life insurance companies\n\nBarbara Marquand is a staff writer atNerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I am 64 and just retired. I haven't taken my Social Security yet. My husband will be 60 and plans on taking an early retirement next year. So, I am holding out on Social Security until then. We don't have huge savings. But my husband will get a pension, and he'll be able to collect on my Social Security until he takes his. He also has a 401(k) plan. Do we have to rollover his 401(k) plan once he retires? Or do we leave it there? If we have to roll it over, what's best to put it in? Savings, IRA? We don't think we should do any investing since it's all we have besides our home and cars.\n\n– Jackie Bogdanski, Illinois\n\nA: So, it's never easy to tell someone what to do with their money in the absence of knowing all the facts and circumstances. But there are some observations and general recommendations worth making.\n\nFirst, you're to be commended on not taking Social Security yet. Many people, about 62% according to recent research on the subject, do take it early and that decision costs them 8% of their income for every year they take early, says Joe Clark, a certified financial planner and managing partner of The Financial Enhancement Group.\n\nIn your case, Clark says delaying was probably the right call assuming you're in reasonable health.\n\nThat said, your husband and you should probably talk to a qualified, competent and knowledgeable expert (and/or crunch your numbers using any of the online Social Security claiming calculators) whether your plan to claim Social Security next year makes the most financial sense, whether it will produce the largest possible benefit to your household.\n\nFor instance, Clark says it might make more sense from a financial and income-tax perspective for your husband to collect his pension, for he and you to withdraw money from your 401(k) plans/IRAs for living expenses, and for both he and you to delay claiming Social for as long as possible, even to age 70 if possible. Doing so would likely result in the largest possible monthly benefit for your husband and you.\n\nGiven that you don't have a large savings I would recommend that you consider living off the 401(k) savings as long as possible and continue to allow your Social Security income to build, says Clark. This will allow you to manage the amount of income that goes on your tax return each year as you can control the distributions and you add 8% to your future Social Security income each year. If the 401(k) has enough you can delay collecting up until age 70.\n\nQ&A: Spousal issues with Social Security leave couples perplexed\n\nNow, the decision to roll all or some of the money in your 401(k) account to an IRA requires a good deal of analysis as well. For instance, at a minimum, you'll want to compare and contrast fees, expenses and investment options. You'll also want to determine what sort of services you require, whether you want to pay for advice or not and how much, whether you need creditor protection, whether you currently own a good deal of company stock in your 401(k), whether consolidating your respective investment accounts makes sense (note: you can only consolidate your own IRAs not each other's); whether you'll need to use the money in your IRA to pay for higher education expenses; whether – if you plan to keep working – you might want to delay taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), and so on. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to tell you want to do in the absence of learning more about your situation. As for how to invest your money, that too is another difficult question to answer. There are at least two strategies to consider: the floor-and-upside approach and the bucket approach.\n\nWith the floor-and-upside approach, you would use guaranteed sources of lifetime income – your pension and Social Security benefits – to pay for your essential expenses, however you define them. If you have a gap, you would buy additional lifetime income – an annuity, for instance. Or you might consider buying bonds and/or CDs and laddering the maturities.\n\nThen, once your essential expenses are covered with guaranteed sources of lifetime income, you would invest whatever was left over in so-called risky assets – stocks and bonds – to pay for discretionary expenses and to pay for living expenses many years from now. After all, you will want some of your investments to be safe and some to keep pace or outpace inflation, or the cost of living.\n\nThe other approach would have you invest in safe assets to pay for expenses over the next one to five years, a mix of safe and risky assets to pay for expenses five to 10 years from now, and risky assets to pay for expenses more than 10 years from now.\n\nGreat retirement planning looks at spending, not income\n\nKeep in mind that actuarial science suggests that when a couple makes it to age 60 and in reasonable health, there's a high probability one of you will be alive at age 90, says Clark. That's 25 years. The days of not having any investments because of age or retirement have passed. You do need to consider reduced volatility in your decision making but it shouldn't be all cash.\n\nNow, should you decide to use the strategy suggested above and spend down your husband's 401(k) and delay your Social Security benefits then you could consider a more cash-type position for your IRA if it will be exhausted in the next two to three years, says Clark. Keep in mind that your 401(k) should also have a money market or short duration bond choice so you don't have to transfer to an IRA to reduce volatility. Remember investing is not as much about age as it is purpose and need.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Quick, take a look at your bank account — or your mailbox: Did up to $600 in stimulus cash show up yet?\n\nIf it didn't, the Internal Revenue Service is telling taxpayers don't call us — and don't call your bank. If you're worried and you're waiting for your money, your best bet is to visit the IRS.gov website.\n\nThe IRS said: IRS phone assisters do not have additional information beyond what's available on IRS.gov.\n\nMost people shouldn't be in panic mode, as the second stimulus money only began rolling out last week. We've got time to see that cash, especially if it's arriving via the mail.\n\nBut if you closed a bank account in the past few months, well, maybe you will need to worry.\n\nI've heard this past weekend from plenty of consumers who say they've spotted the deposit into their bank accounts already. So far, I've not heard from any who are complaining just yet about the second round of stimulus payments. I continue to hear from a few readers who did not receive their first stimulus payments.\n\n21 stocks to buy in 2021:Disney, AutoZone and PayPal are among stocks to consider buying\n\nEconomy in 2021:Vaccine-fueled rebound expected\n\nStarting on Monday, the IRS said, people could begin to check the status of both their first and second payments by using the Get My Payment tool, available in English and Spanish at IRS.gov.\n\nBut an early check of that site indicated that you might face a wait time trying to log into it. Due to high demand, you may have to wait longer than usual to access this site. We appreciate your patience, the IRS site said shortly after 2 p.m. Monday when I tried to access it.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nBank accounts: Most people will see this latest round of stimulus money via direct deposit into their bank accounts. According to the IRS, the scheduled payment date is Jan. 4, which is the official date funds are available.\n\nThe direct deposit is being made to those who have valid routing and account information on file.\n\nBut the IRS also warned that some individuals might experience some glitches.\n\nBecause of the speed at which IRS issued this second round of payments, the IRS stated Monday, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or no longer active.\n\nIf that happened, the financial institution is going to have to return the money to the IRS. If so, you might not be too happy because you could have to wait and wait.\n\nWhile the IRS is exploring options to correct these payments, if you have not received your full payment by the time you file your 2020 tax return, you may claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your tax return, the IRS said Monday.\n\nYou're not going to be able to call and try to fix things. The IRS cannot change payment information, including bank account or mailing information, the IRS said.\n\nThe second payments are up to $600 for individuals who qualify; up to $1,200 for a married couple filing a joint return with no children, and an extra $600 for qualifying children ages 16 and younger.\n\nPaper checks: Some checks went out Dec. 30 but the IRS noted on Monday that paper checks will continue to be sent through January.\n\nMailed payments will require more processing and mailing time, the IRS said. Those who reside abroad will have longer wait times for checks as disruptions to air travel and mail delivery in some countries will slow delivery.\n\nPlastic debit cards: It is possible that you will receive your second stimulus on a plastic Visa debit card issued by MetaBank. And you might get a debit card even if you received a paper check for the first Economic Impact Payment sent in 2020.\n\nDo not throw out these debit cards.\n\nThe Economic Impact Payment Card will be sent in a white envelope that prominently displays the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal, the IRS stated.\n\nThe Visa name is on the front of this plastic card. The issuing bank is MetaBank and listed on the back of the card. For more information about these cards, see EIPcard.com.\n\nA limited number of payments are being sent out by debit card.\n\nNot everyone gets the stimulus dough: Some people won't get any money or they might see a reduced payment, based on their income.\n\nThe IRS noted: Most people who have an adjusted gross income for 2019 of up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses, will receive the full amount of the second payment.\n\nContactSusan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

USA TODAY\n\nIn a report issued Wednesday, the National Taxpayer Advocate warned that the IRS focus on reducing phone calls would hurt taxpayer service and increase costs. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nMake tax rules less complicated and less confusing, and you would get fewer phone calls.\n\n— David Leung\n\nAbolish this inefficient, corrupt agency and replace it with some sort of flat tax.\n\n— Paul Catorce\n\nTax forms got more complicated with the Affordable Care Act and buying health insurance from the exchanges. My friend now needs to pay more to his tax preparer because he has an extra form that needs to be filed with his income taxes.\n\nThe flat tax is a joke.\n\n— Erik Hassold\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nObama�s gun proposals won�t make big difference: #tellusatoday\n\nWe can't have the IRS continue to be a money drain on our government.

Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this story contained the wrong phone number for the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center appointment hotline. The number is 844-545-5640.\n\nOpening Day for the IRS is Monday.\n\nThat's when the Internal Revenue Service will start accepting electronically filed tax returns. We have until April 18 to file returns but many file earlier in the season, if they're expecting large refunds.\n\nThe tax filing deadline this year is Tuesday, April 18, instead of the traditional April 15, because of some quirks of the calendar. April 15 is a Saturday. But the deadline won't be shifted to Monday, April 17, because that is Emancipation Day, which is celebrated in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat do tax filers need to know this season?\n\n1. Get an appointment if you want to talk to someone at IRS offices\n\nDon't expect to drop into an IRS office to get any help this tax season. All offices are appointment-only now.\n\nIf you need to visit an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center in person, you must schedule a time by calling 844-545-5640 for the appointment hotline.\n\nTaxpayers are asked to check IRS.gov for the days and hours of service, as well as the services offered at the location they plan to visit.\n\nMore on taxes:\n\nTax refund advances get big marketing push in 2017\n\nSome families can't bank on a tax refund before Feb. 27\n\nMore W-2s to have a 16-digit code to fight tax fraud\n\n2. Beware of a new hurdle if you've used a special Individual Taxpayer Identification Number\n\nSome tax filers will be unable to file their federal tax returns if they do not update Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. Warning: Any ITIN that has not been used in the past three years will no longer work for filing that return.\n\nOn top of that, individual tax identification numbers that have middle digits of 78 or 79 also expired this year.\n\nTax filers in these situations must renew an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number as early as possible because they cannot file a tax return without one.\n\nThe super-sized headache? The IRS notes that it can take up to 11 weeks during the peak of the tax season to get that number from the time you send in a renewal application, known as Form W-7, for the IRS to process the application and notify you about your status.\n\nWhy the change? A new federal law to combat fraud included the requirement that certain Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers expired on Jan. 1.\n\nAnyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delay as well as denial of some tax benefits until the ITIN is renewed, the IRS said online in a statement.\n\nThese identification numbers often are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number.\n\n3. Some struggling families will face delays for their tax refunds\n\nThe IRS notes that more than nine out of 10 refunds will be issued within less than 21 days, which is good news.\n\nBut tax filers who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit should not expect their refunds until possibly the week of Feb. 27, even if they file as soon as this week.\n\nThe reason? Congress is cracking down on tax-return-related fraud. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act mandated the IRS delay issuing tax refunds for returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The move is designed to give the IRS more time to detect fraud and prevent refunds from being issued to ID thieves who file fake tax returns using such credits.\n\nBut consumers who depend on the refund cash will face extra delays, given holidays and weekends.\n\nAnother thing to note: The IRS online Where's My Refund tool will not show an estimated date for many tax returns involving the special credits until after Feb. 15.\n\nSo don't panic in late January and mid-February if you don't see a refund date on 'Where's My Refund.' That's just how the tool will operate given the special circumstances with the EITC and ACTC refunds, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in prepared remarks in early January.\n\nWhere's My Refund at www.irs.gov and the IRS2Go phone app will be updated a few days after Feb. 15 with projected deposit dates for the early filers who receive the earned income credit and additional child credit.\n\nMore from Susan Tompor:\n\nHow much is too much for a car payment?\n\nFinancial resolutions for the New Year: 17 for '17\n\nChase's 100,000 bonus points coming to a stop\n\n4. Look out for high-cost, quick-cash on tax refund advances\n\nTax filers might be tempted by refund anticipation loans that proclaim no fee will be charged. But Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center, warns that in some cases, borrowers could face other higher fees for tax preparation or another product.\n\nAdvance loans are being heavily marketed this year by some firms, including H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, in light of the new delays ahead for tax refunds for those who file those Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit.\n\nJackson Hewitt is marketing for its Express Refund Advance, a loan of up to $1,300 that has no fees, a 0% annual percentage rate and no credit check. To get the loan, you will have to pay to file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt.\n\nH&R Block began offering a tax-related loan for a limited time beginning Jan. 6. The H&R Block Refund Advance offers loans in the amounts of $500, $750, or $1,250 upfront for 0% interest.\n\nThe loan is loaded onto an H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard.\n\nThe amount of the advance will be deducted from tax refunds and reduce the amount that is paid directly to the taxpayer. Both Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block only offer the loans to customers who visit their offices and outlets; it's not available online.\n\n5. Take a close look at that W-2 Form\n\nSome tax filers are going to discover that they have to deal with a Form W-2 Verification Code.\n\nAbout 50 million W-2 forms will include a 16-digit verification code that tax filers or preparers will need to add when prompted by tax software. About 2 million W-2s had such a code during the 2016 filing season.\n\nThe IRS anticipates that the verification code ultimately will be used on all W-2 forms in future years.\n\nAgain, we're looking at another hurdle to try to corral the crooks and prevent the filing of fake tax returns.\n\n6. Remember, scam artists love tax season\n\nWe continue to ask the public to be vigilant because the scamming doesn't stop, said Luis D. Garcia, IRS spokesperson in Detroit.\n\nThe con artists pretending to be from the IRS might reach out via your e-mail inbox, your mailbox or even knock on your front door, Garcia said.\n\nAnd the crooks are going after tax preparers, too.\n\nEarlier in January, the IRS warned that cyber criminals were pretending to be tax filers who wanted help filing their returns.\n\nThe first e-mail says something like: I need a preparer to file my taxes.\n\nIf the tax preparer responds, a second e-mail is sent that has either an embedded web address or contains a PDF attachment that has an embedded web address.\n\nThe tax professional may think they are downloading a potential client's tax information or accessing a site with the potential client's tax information, the IRS warned.\n\nIn reality, the cyber criminals are collecting the preparer's e-mail address and password and possibly other information.\n\nOddly enough, I even got one of these phishing e-mails last week. The language was stilted and off-kilter, which can be a warning sign.\n\nIt began Hello, CPA, which I am not.\n\nI need a careful and experienced high-quality accountant, to handle all matters of accounting including tax preparation, IRS problem resolution, and matters expected of a CPAs to handle for Individual and Small Business, the e-mail read.\n\nI don't need that stereotypically dull, introverted and boring accountants, I believe in the value of partnership in business relationships.\n\nFind attached is my tax documents.\n\nLove that last line. I'd love to respond: Find this attachment for a way to learn how to diagram sentences and master subject-verb agreements.\n\nBut then again, we don't want the scammers to get even better at this game, do we? Best to kill and ignore all such phishing e-mails.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Officials said Tuesday that the state will see a slight increase, about 16%, in COVID-19 vaccine doses coming in federal shipments, but the ongoing shortage remains the chief obstacle to getting more people inoculated. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. is boosting deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks to increase vaccinations. I'm pleased that Alabama will receive a slight increase in our vaccine supply. Any margin of increase is appreciated, but we have a long way to go to be able to provide them to any Alabamian who wants one, Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Alabama will receive an additional 10,000 first doses in its upcoming delivery. The state had been receiving about 50,000 to 60,000 first doses each week but will see that jump to 70,000 in coming weeks, according to numbers supplied by Harris. That does not include second doses, and Harris said it is unclear if the increase will be sustained longer than three weeks. Ivey said the state will also have the flexibility to redistribute unused doses in the federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State health officials plan to launch a live phone service for residents trying to schedule vaccination appointments. The state currently provides an answering service through which residents seeking appointments can only leave messages, Alaska Public Media reports. The hotline will become available in anticipation of a February shipment of COVID-19 vaccine from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's administration said Monday. Tessa Walker Linderman of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said more than 40 staff members will answer calls from people wanting to book appointments. Many of the workers were previously tasked with tracing the contacts of people who were infected with the coronavirus. A decrease in the number of new cases has allowed those employees to shift to the hotline, Walker Linderman said. Callers may still have to wait, but the system should allow personal interaction within reasonable amounts of time rather than automatically requiring residents to wait for return calls. New appointment openings are expected to be added to the state's vaccine website starting Thursday, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a move intended to accelerate a lagging COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday issued new rules, including giving the state authority to take unused doses back from providers and reallocate them. Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said that in addition to limiting factors in terms of the federal supply, said some providers may not be using all their vaccine doses. It's going to require certain providers that have 40% or more of their doses being reported as unused, they are going to have to submit a plan to the department that tells us how they are going to significantly increase and use that vaccine within the next seven days, Christ said of the new reporting requirements. If we don't agree they've got a great plan, we can take doses back at the state level. Health providers in Arizona are either not reporting that they are administering the COVID-19 vaccine or simply not administering it at the rate state officials want to see, Christ said. The new requirements will give the state authority to take back unused doses from providers who don't have adequate plans to use them, she said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging the early closing time for bars and some restaurants that was temporarily imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit argued Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state officials did not have authority to order bars and restaurants to close by 11 p.m. The Republican governor announced the order in November in response to a surge in coronavirus cases, and in December it was extended to Feb. 3. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who dismissed the suit, called the rational basis for the early closing time obvious given the number of people who have died from COVID-19 nationally and in the state. Public health and safety concerns is a rational basis for regulating how and when people gather to dine and drink alcoholic beverages in commercial establishments, he wrote. Hutchinson said he was glad Griffen dismissed the suit but said a decision had not yet been made on whether to extend the early closing time. An attorney for the group of Fayetteville bars and restaurants challenging the early time said they were discussing whether to appeal the decision.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A troop of gorillas at San Diego Zoo Safari Park appears to be recovering from the coronavirus – including a 49-year-old silverback who received antibody therapy – in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates. The western lowland gorillas were infected with a variant that has been circulating in California and is believed to be more contagious than other strains, the safari park said Monday in a statement. Some gorillas showed symptoms including mild coughing, congestion and intermittent lethargy. The silverback named Winston had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He has been more active since being put on antibiotics and heart medication, as well as receiving an antibody treatment – a therapy to block the virus from infecting cells, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a statement. We're not seeing any of that lethargy. No coughing, no runny noses anymore, the park's executive director Lisa Peterson told the San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that the animals' fecal matter is no longer testing positive for the virus. It feels to us like we've turned the corner.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Out of dozens of requests for sentence reductions from inmates with health concerns amid the pandemic, federal judges in Colorado approved just three in the final four months of 2020. Judges have the power to apply legal criteria differently when weighing requests for so-called compassionate release, Colorado Politics reports. Federal inmates can petition courts directly if there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to leave prison, which could include elevated threat to life from COVID-19. In 24 opinions published from September through December in response to compassionate release requests, judges in the U.S. District Court in Colorado found the health condition of inmates or the level of virus transmission in prisons was not severe. The judges commonly denied requests to those who were not 65 or older, who had not served 75% of their sentence, or whose family circumstances did not merit release. In two opinions denying compassionate release, Senior Judge Marcia S. Krieger found that inmates may be safer from COVID-19 in prison than outside of it.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state's unionized prison guards expressed anger Wednesday over what they say is the lack of a plan to vaccinate them against COVID-19. Jody Barr, the executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said the union was told there would be a plan to vaccinate prison employees by early January, but they have yet to hear when they might get the vaccine or how it will be distributed to them. The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65. Only after those people are vaccinated will appointments be opened to those with preexisting medical conditions and essential workers.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Making mail-in voting permanent, mandating higher use of renewable energy and more than doubling education funding for disadvantaged students are among Democratic Gov. John Carney's plans for Delaware. Carney outlined those and other goals, including providing body cameras for every police officer in Delaware, in an online State of the State address Tuesday. He also pledged to continue working to ensure that as many Delawareans as possible receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even as restrictions he imposed on businesses and individuals remain in place. Over the course of my 30 years in public service, and even during the course of this administration, I have seen government tackle countless, serious and complicated challenges, Carney said while discussing the pandemic. Nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the last ten months. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, civil unrest, racial tensions and a contentious election, Carney described the state of the state as resilient. It's determined. It's strong. And it's getting stronger, he said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown University confirmed some first- and second-year medical students received the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not eligible, WUSA-TV reports. Higher-level medical students have been approved to get the vaccine because they are in hospitals working with patients, according to a Georgetown University spokesperson. Neither Georgetown University nor MedStar Health/MedStar Georgetown University Hospital reportedly authorized the vaccine for students who did not fit the criteria. We've taken the necessary steps to ensure this is avoided in the future. These actions run contrary to Georgetown's values as a Jesuit institution, teaching our students to be in service to others, a spokesperson for the school said. The School of Medicine takes violations of professionalism extremely seriously and will be taking appropriate action as outlined in its Code of Professionalism in the Student Handbook. Georgetown University said in a statement that it would not discuss individual students and how many got unauthorized vaccinations because of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Seniors will get their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared Tuesday, even as frustration grows nationally over spotty supplies of the life-saving medicine. Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department. While good news for those waiting to get inoculated, it surely won't satiate the demand for the vaccine – even if the increased shipment does help ease concerns about availability for the growing number awaiting booster shots. Of the more than 1.4 million in Florida who have gotten shots, less than 11% have gotten their second dose, according to the latest records provided by the state Health Department. That means more than a million people – most of them at least 65 years old – are coming due for the second of two shots required to achieve the highest level of efficacy against the disease.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A member of the state House was removed from the chamber Tuesday for not abiding by the Legislature's coronavirus testing policy. Rep. David Clark, R-Buford, was asked to leave the chamber floor by House Speaker David Ralston. Clark refused to leave on his own and had to be escorted out by police. Members of the Legislature are supposed to undergo testing on Mondays and Thursdays. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen said in a statement that the member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session. The statement said he'll be able to return once he complies with the policy. Clark also had his office space in a building adjacent to the Capitol temporarily taken away. Clark, not wearing a face mask, told reporters he is abstaining from twice-a-week testing until it is available to everyone in the state, particularly teachers and first responders. Testing in Georgia is available to anyone who wants it and is widely accessible. You know, sometimes this job isn't all it's cracked up to be, Ralston said after having Clark removed. I don't know about you all, but I've been to too many funerals.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Birthday plans for one of Hawaii's most esteemed houses have raised concerns over the proposed $53,000 cost while the state deals with significant economic problems stemming from the pandemic. Democratic Gov. David Ige proposed the commemoration of Washington Place, the longtime residence of Queen Liliuokalani and a dozen governors, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Honolulu property, which became a museum and state reception venue nearly two decades ago, turns 175 years old this year. The $53,000 tab represents a tiny portion of Ige's proposed $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But the cost has been questioned in the face of impending cuts to state jobs, programs and services. Hawaii faces projected $1.4 billion revenue shortfalls for each of the next four years. What kind of celebration is being planned during COVID, with the inability to gather, that would require that much (money), Democratic Rep. Lisa Marten, a member of the House Finance Committee, asked Ige chief of staff Linda Chu Takayama at a recent budget hearing. Takayama said details have not been finalized, but it's not a whole lot of money. Private donations are expected to match the state's contribution.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State health care leaders are pressing federal officials to explain why Idaho was allotted far fewer doses of COVID-19 vaccine than most other states. Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates. The legislation that created Idaho's voluntary immunization tracking system doesn't allow the state to collect some demographic information, including race or ethnicity and profession.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools should allow students back into classrooms in no more than 100 facilities and then gradually reopen others, an organization of school principals proposed Wednesday, saying most of them doubt the nation's third-largest school district can safely handle a mass reopening. Troy LaRaviere, the president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, said during a news conference that a survey revealed its members don't believe there will be enough staff at schools to safely reopen, nor enough safety supplies to guard against the spread of COVID-19. And he said the members haven't received adequate guidance from the district on how to reopen the schools that have been closed since March. We salute the district's goals, LaRaviere said in a statement. However, their plans are not realistic or safe for most of our schools. The new plan also says vaccinating teachers and other staff at the first schools to reopen should be a priority. That, LaRaviere said, would not only make the schools safer but also make teachers more willing to return to classrooms. Some special education and pre-K teachers had refused to return to in-person teaching this month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Crowd size limits will be relaxed starting next week following recent improvements in the statewide COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the governor announced Wednesday. The new rules will allow gatherings at up to 25% capacity at venues in counties with the two highest-risk levels of coronavirus spread on the state's four-level rating system, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. The new rules starting Monday will replace the current 25-person crowd limit for the highest-risk counties that's been in place since mid-November. Holcomb said he was trying to balance lives and livelihoods with the relaxed restrictions. All 92 counties remain at the highest restriction categories under two-week trends of the state Department of Health's weekly tracking map. But that number could drop in coming weeks, as Wednesday's updated map labels five of Indiana's 92 counties in the most dangerous red category, down from 34 counties last week and 73 two weeks ago. State health officials said they still aren't expanding COVID-19 vaccine availability to those younger than 70 because of limited dose availability. They expect to extend vaccine eligibility to those ages 65-69 in the coming weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State lawmakers are considering allowing dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shots. The proposal, House Study Bill 71, received its first hearing at a House subcommittee Tuesday but did not advance. Lawmakers said they wanted more time to consider the measure. If it became law, dentists would be required to complete four hours of training related to prescribing and administering vaccines. They would not be allowed to delegate vaccine administration to dental hygienists or dental assistants. Rep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, who is a pharmacist, said his practice is getting overrun by calls from people who want the vaccine. Forbes did not sit on the subcommittee but urged his colleagues to push the proposal forward. But Dennis Tibben, a lobbyist for the Iowa Medical Association, which opposes the bill, said there are enough doctors and pharmacists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine without adding dentists as well. It's not necessarily the case that we don't have enough folks to administer the vaccine; it's that we don't have enough vaccine, he said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republican legislators suggested Tuesday that mistakes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's administration are making it more difficult for older residents to get COVID-19 vaccines. But Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department and Kelly's top public health administrator, said the biggest problem Kansas faces in administering the vaccines is there's just not enough. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature have grown increasingly critical of Kelly and the Department of Health and Environment, peppering Norman with pointed questions during Tuesday's joint meeting of the House and Senate health committees. One GOP lawmaker even argued that Kansas was wrong to focus on vaccinating health care workers first, rather than people 65 and older. I've never felt like our leadership, the Kelly administration, the KDHE, has learned lessons from this virus and adapted strategies to it, said freshman Sen. Mark Steffen, a Hutchinson Republican and a physician, who didn't wear a mask at Tuesday's socially distanced meeting and said he doubts the effectiveness of mask-wearing, despite a growing scientific consensus that masks provide protection for others as well as those wearing them.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Faced with a weakening of his executive powers, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has offered an outline for potential compromises in a letter to top Republican legislative leaders. Beshear sent the letter to House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers last week, soon after vetoing a series of bills that would limit his executive authority, including in times of emergency. The governor doesn't have much leverage unless he can mobilize public support for his proposals. GOP lawmakers have the numbers to override his vetoes when they resume their session in early February. The governor has said the measures would hamper the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. Beshear's letter said his strong preference is to hold off on legislation altering executive powers until Kentucky has overcome the pandemic. But he told the House and Senate leaders his letter was an attempt to provide a potential framework for discussion and compromise. If the General Assembly is determined – even in the midst of a deadly pandemic and in spite of our comparatively successful response – on passing legislation, then I recommend we discuss narrowly tailoring that legislation to address concerns that you raise, Beshear wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A judge has refused to toss out six criminal complaints filed against a pastor charged with violating gathering capacity rules put in place during the early days of the pandemic. Nineteenth Judicial District Judge Eboni Johnson-Rose on Monday dismissed pastor Tony Spell's motion to have the case against him dropped, news outlets report. The judge's ruling sided with a special assistant to the district attorney who argued that when the charges were filed in the early days of the outbreak, New Orleans was a national coronavirus hot spot, and Louisiana was under a declared emergency, The Advocate reports. Prosecutors alleged Spell violated public gathering capacity limits Gov. John Bel Edwards put in place last spring by continuing to host worship services at his Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge with hundreds in attendance. He was accused six times in March of violating the orders. Spell said he did not attend his hearing Monday because he refused to wear a mask inside the courthouse. He and more than a dozen supporters and church members instead gathered across the street to protest the charges, with Spell later telling The Advocate the judge ruled against God by not voiding his offenses.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to launch a system to allow residents to register for a COVID-19 vaccine. The statewide system will include a website and a telephone option, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Nirav Shah said Tuesday. Maine is looking to launch the registry system in as little as a few weeks and at a time when demand for vaccines greatly outstrips supply. More than 115,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state, but most of the population is still not able to access it. The registry system will be designed to allow residents to consent to the vaccine and sign up for an appointment to receive it. Meanwhile, Maine's public university system has expanded its coronavirus wastewater monitoring program through the end of the spring semester. The University of Maine System said it's adding new sample collection sites and increasing sampling and testing frequency. The university system uses the program to track for the presence of the virus on its campuses and in surrounding areas. The system said samples will be collected twice weekly at campuses around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate plans to add about $520 million to Gov. Larry Hogan's proposal to help Maryland recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading Democrats who control the chamber announced Wednesday. Democrats are keeping the Republican governor's proposals in his $1 billion plan over several years. The Senate's proposed additions would come this year, focusing largely on education, business, health, housing aid, transportation and unemployment assistance. It would bring the total amount of the proposal to almost $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year. This is the immediate relief that Marylanders need, said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. Hogan's plan includes direct stimulus payments to low-to-moderate income residents, with benefits of up to $750 for families and $450 for individuals. It repeals all state and local income taxes on unemployment benefits. The governor's plan also includes sales tax credits of up to $3,000 a month for four months for small businesses. The governor's proposal is on top of roughly $700 million the state already has allocated in aid relating to the pandemic.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: All residents 75 and older are now eligible to make an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but Wednesday's online rollout did not go smoothly for some. Residents could start scheduling an appointment starting at midnight for shots being administered starting Monday at one of more than 80 sites around the state, from mass vaccination sites like Gillette Stadium to local pharmacies and supermarkets. Monica Nelson, a retired nurse from Newburyport, told The Boston Globe she spent two hours trying to get her 75-year-old husband a slot with no luck. She called the rollout a disaster. Syracuse University student Ghael Fobes, on the other hand, logged on just after midnight and was able to make appointments for his grandparents. State health officials urged patience, warning that it may take several weeks to get an appointment and that as more vaccine supply arrives, additional appointments will become available. Once vaccinations are completed for residents 75 and older, those who are older than 65, and those with two chronic illnesses or medical conditions will be eligible.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans in the state House on Wednesday proposed a $3.5 billion coronavirus recovery plan but threatened to withhold billions to K-12 schools unless Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cedes her administration's power to prohibit in-person instruction and sports to local health departments. The state health department in November ordered a temporary ban on face-to-face learning in high schools to help curb a surge in COVID-19 cases, lifting it later. A prohibition on youth contact sports remains. Some Michigan school districts haven't had in-person classes since March. That's hurting kids in ways we can't even imagine, and not just academically, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, said in a statement. By law, K-12 districts and charter schools decide whether to allow in-person classes. Although the Democratic governor has strongly urged schools to offer a face-to-face learning option by March 1, House Republicans want to entice public schools by offering up to $250 per student in funding if they commit to reopening by Feb. 15.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Some hospital systems are flouting state and federal guidance on the hierarchy for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health has deputized large health systems to distribute the vaccine as part of a public-private partnership. Currently the state has prioritized inoculating people who provide in-person health care services or people living and working in congregate care settings. But at places like Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners and Allina Health, people who don't have patient contact or who can work from home are getting vaccinated, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The health systems have been far more lenient in vaccinating people than was intended, and that's concerning, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said. We felt like we were pretty clear in the guidance. In some cases, people like fitness instructors and construction workers are getting shots, whether they are at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 or not. The situation raises questions about distribution, access and equity with a limited supply of doses.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi is unconquerable after a year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters including tornadoes that cut wide paths of destruction last Easter, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said in his State of the State speech Tuesday. Speaking on the south steps of the Capitol, Reeves renewed his call for eliminating the state's personal income tax and said he would sign a bill to increase teachers' pay. He called on legislators to make wise investments in workforce training. And he vowed that the state will vaccinate people against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. We need to crush this virus and get back to our way of life, Reeves said. The virus is still here, and it cannot be solved by ignoring it. We have to defeat it because Mississippians are done. We're done burying loved ones who were lost to this virus. We're done with overwhelmed hospitals. We're done with the fearful talk of lockdowns and shutdowns. We're ready for community again. Reeves served eight years as state treasurer and eight as lieutenant governor before becoming governor last January. His first year in the job was dominated by the pandemic, with the first virus cases found in Mississippi in March.\n\nMissouri\n\nO'Fallon: Republican Gov. Mike Parson plans to divert thousands of unused doses of COVID-19 vaccine from CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to other state-enrolled vaccinators to help the slower-than-expected vaccination process, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the administration has requested the return of 25,000 doses from CVS and Walgreens, which would then be rerouted to county health departments, medical hospitals and clinics, and hundreds of other state-approved vaccinators. The pharmacy chains were tasked with providing vaccinations at long-term care facilities under a Trump administration plan unveiled in December. Jones said Missouri's new plan won't affect shots for workers and residents at those facilities that have been ravaged by COVID-19. Our objective, though, is for those vaccines allocated in Missouri to be administered into people's arms, and we're kind of disappointed how that federal pharmacy program has gone, Jones said. According to data posted Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri ranks last among states for the share of residents who have received an initial vaccine dose.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Montana House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that seeks to protect free speech on public university campuses in the state – even as university administrators say their campuses already protect free speech. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Hopkins said current university policy allows some groups, including conservative organizations, to be silenced on campuses, and the measure would ensure students are exposed to a broad range of views even if they do not agree with them. I might make you angry; you might make me angry, said Hopkins, a Republican from Missoula, home to the University of Montana. But I'm not going to shut you up, and you're not going to shut me up. That sentiment was echoed by several university students who spoke in favor of the bill during the hearing. Some said they believed existing policies prevented them from voicing controversial viewpoints on their campuses. The current policies of University of Montana and other colleges around here put at risk that freedom and that right, that responsibility to develop ourselves intellectually and to grapple with things that we may not be comfortable with, said Ethan Holmes, who graduated from the University of Montana in 2019 with a degree in Russian and political science.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials in the Omaha area are allocating $10 million of unspent federal coronavirus relief aid for rent, food aid and mental health services. Douglas County Board member Mike Boyle said many people continue to be evicted from their homes despite a federal moratorium. And he described Tuesday's decision to give $2 million in rent and mortgage assistance to the Metro Area Continuum of Care for the Homeless to distribute as a rare opportunity to help people who are really hurting. County officials have said many people who needed help with rent weren't able to meet federal coronavirus relief requirements, the Omaha World-Herald reports. They aren't going to have to jump through all the hoops that are put together by the feds, Boyle said. Another $6 million will be earmarked for mental health, although the details haven't been finalized. Board Chair Mary Ann Borgeson said it may go to such things as training for 911 operators and dispatchers, or a program to send mental health professionals to crisis calls to 911. The board also unanimously approved allowing $2 million to the the Food Bank for the Heartland.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials said second doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be offered at the Las Vegas Convention Center beginning next week. The Southern Nevada Health District said the appointment-only clinic will open Feb. 2 for people who received their first doses at a health district clinic and are eligible to receive their boosters. The district has started to notify people who are eligible, including those who received their first shots at Western High School, Cashman Center or the health district's main office in Las Vegas. People who were vaccinated at one of the locations and do not receive a notification can call the district to make appointments for the second doses. Residents who received their first doses at other locations will not be eligible. Health officials recommend that the second dose of vaccine be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. The interval for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days, and for the Moderna vaccine it is 28 days. The two vaccines are not interchangeable.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Businesses that have been fined for violating emergency orders during the pandemic would get their money back under a GOP-sponsored bill that went before a House committee Wednesday. Rep. Andrew Prout, R-Hudson, told the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that eight businesses have been fined a total of $10,000 so far. His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States! We know how to wash our hands, clean surfaces and NOT cough or sneeze on people.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state is set to get a 30% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next three weeks, a top health official said Wednesday. New Jersey's allotment of vaccines from the federal government will rise from about 100,000 doses a week to 130,000 for three weeks, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand. The state saw 107 additional deaths from the virus overnight, putting the total toll at 19,091. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases fell over the past two weeks from 6,190 a day Jan. 12 to 5,146 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020. That compares to $160 million in benefits paid overall in 2019, when the state unemployment rate fell below 4%. In 2019, the division reported nearly $7 million in overpayments. Overpayments can happen due to fraud or unintentional mistakes that lead a person to receive benefits to which they aren't entitled, Gibson said. The division reported that $9 million in benefits since March 31 have been paid out due to identity theft.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Wednesday lowered the statewide risk level for the coronavirus, increasing the recommended occupancy limit for bars, restaurants and other food service establishments. Burgum noted that active cases dropped by 1,016 Wednesday from more than 10,000 in mid-November and that the state's 14-day positivity rate has decreased to about 3%, the lowest since Aug. 22. The governor adjusted the risk level from moderate to low effective Jan. 29. We're grateful to all North Dakotans, including our medical, education and business communities, for their actions that have contributed to these positive results, Burgum said in a statement. We continue to use a data-driven approach to navigate this pandemic, and all data indicates North Dakota is heading in the right direction. A low risk level increased occupancy limits at bars and restaurants from 65% of the establishment's licensed capacity up to 200 patrons and to 80% of licensed capacity up to 300 patrons, with social distancing. Face covering are strongly recommended or required.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An anonymous donor has given Kenyon College a $100 million donation, the largest in school history, for the construction of three new residence halls, the liberal arts college announced Tuesday. The central Ohio school of about 1,600 students, which requires all students to live on campus, said the donation allows it to continue a focus on a residential college experience despite the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. Kenyon is conducting both online and in-person classes this year, and it reduced the on-campus population to allow all students to live in single rooms. To receive this record-breaking gift during a pandemic that is still gripping our country and disrupting our academic year speaks volumes about the strength of Kenyon's future, school President Sean Decatur said in a statement. Decatur said the donation will also allow Kenyon, founded in 1824, to renew its efforts to grow the college endowment for scholarships and financial aid. Kenyon received a $75 million anonymous donation in 2017 allowing it to build a new library and academic quad on the campus of the school in Gambier, about 58 miles northeast of Columbus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state attorney general's office is attempting to return $2 million worth of a malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump as an effective treatment for COVID-19, a spokesman said Wednesday. Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Hunter is attempting to negotiate a return of the 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills Oklahoma acquired in April from a California-based supplier, FFF Enterprises. He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March, and he didn't want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of COVID-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma's purchase to something that happens in the fog of war.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Health officials in the tri-county Portland metro area said Tuesday that tens of thousands of front-line health care workers have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and that it will likely take weeks before most do. One solution is allocating more doses of the vaccine to the populated area, said Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health director. Guernsey said officials have spoken to the Oregon Health Authority about this option and have not received an outright denial. There really is no easy way to say this: Right now we are in a situation in the metro area where we have more people eligible for the vaccine than we actually have vaccine in the metro area, Guernsey said. This is an incredibly frustrating situation. Health leaders in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties announced Tuesday that the online regional COVID-19 Phase 1A vaccination sign-up survey launched Jan. 12 is now closed because of the limited vaccine supply. Health officials said that while 60,000 eligible people applied for vaccines through the survey, only 11,000 were sent invitations to be vaccinated.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf defended the state's rollout of COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday, saying that it was left in the lurch by the Trump administration's overpromises and that a decentralized vaccine sign-up system should prove to be more efficient, as opposed to a centralized portal some states use. He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations. Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University allowed some smaller classes to meet in person starting Wednesday. Classes of 19 students or fewer are now allowed under Level 2 of the Ivy League school's coronavirus protocols. The campus has three activity levels, with Level 1 being the most restrictive. All levels still require face coverings and social distancing. Libraries are open, but students are required to reserve study space online and check out books using a contactless circulation system. Office hours and advising are still remote. Athletic and recreational facilities remain closed. Socializing is only allowed in groups of five or fewer students unless outdoors, where social distancing can be maintained. The university bookstore is open only to members of the Brown community, and a university ID is required for admission. Students are still required to follow all state and federal guidelines.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill that would assure lawmakers have a chance to change or end a prolonged state of emergency from Gov. Henry McMaster passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic, now more than 10 months old, exposed some problems with South Carolina's emergency law, which had not been altered in almost 60 years except to add the words public health emergency in 2002. Under current law, McMaster can only issue an emergency declaration for 15 days before the General Assembly has to weigh in. To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday. The bill would allow the General Assembly to weigh in within 30 days. They could end or continue a state of emergency with one vote of each chamber or alter it through a more lengthy process. If they don't meet, the emergency declaration would last as long as the governor wishes. The current emergency law was created in a time when people thought more of hurricanes and less about pandemics and modern governments that require continuity and quick reactions, whether it means shutdowns or rapid vaccine rollouts.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state will be receiving more COVID-19 vaccine doses in the coming weeks, the Department of Health said Wednesday. The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it. About 65% of health care workers offered the vaccine have taken it, and at least 95% of nursing home residents have received the vaccine.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state government at one point expected to get as many as 400,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from the Trump administration's supposed reserve, which would've been a windfall for a state with untapped distribution capacity and limited supply, Tennessee's top health official confirmed. Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey. We had calculated internally, just internal calculations, that we could get up to 400,000 – like this big (influx) of 400,000 doses, she said. And it turns out, nah, that didn't happen.Tennessee's vaccine shortage is some of the latest fallout from the chaotic end of the Trump administration. Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, in one of his final news interviews in the job, told NBC News on Jan. 15 that the stockpile was empty because the Trump administration already released those doses to states.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge on Tuesday expressed frustration over what she saw as a lack of progress in efforts to try to relieve overcrowding at Texas' largest county jail, where some inmates have described the facility as a metal can of contagion amid worries about a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns about the Harris County Jail were raised this month by Sheriff Ed Gonzalez after its population ballooned to more than 9,000 inmates, leaving little room to quarantine prisoners who test positive for the virus or to separate new inmates when they first arrive. The jail population had only dropped to about 8,800 inmates as of Tuesday, with most awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal, presiding over a lawsuit that accuses the county's felony bail system of keeping poor defendants locked up only because they can't afford to pay a bond, had asked the sheriff's office, prosecutors, public defenders and state court judges to see if some inmates facing low level, nonviolent felony charges and who were being held on bonds of $10,000 or less could be eligible for bond reductions. But the Harris County District Attorney's Office said it would only agree to bond reductions in 60 of 1,500 identified cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city's school district has reopened to elementary students after increased pressure from state lawmakers and parents amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Salt Lake City School District board first voted to reopen middle schools and high schools after all teachers and staff were vaccinated, but it extended its vote to open all schools by Feb. 8, KUER-FM reports. It's a little scary with the virus still going on, said Marissa Book, who dropped off her kindergartener daughter, Vivian, at Franklin Elementary School for its first day back Monday. But they honestly need it. Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiologist Mary Hill said the schools reopened with all safety precautions and will likely continue to follow measures closely, such as closing a school if 1% of its population tests positive for the virus. The question now is whether bringing older students back to campuses will lead to an increase in social gatherings outside of the school, she said. A lot of the transmission, I don't believe, has been occurring in school, Hill said. They take off their mask, and they go to their social activities and go to each other's houses and play. And then they bring it back to school.\n\nVermont\n\nHardwick: The COVID-19 vaccination program for residents 75 or older began Wednesday at a number of locations across the state. Registration opened Monday for people in the age group, and by Wednesday morning more than 29,000 people had signed up. A clinic held in the gymnasium at Hazen Union High School in Hardwick gave its first inoculation about 9 a.m. With three vaccination stations, officials hoped to vaccinate 150 people the first day, said Valerie Valcour, the public health nurse running the clinic. We are working through some of the little kinks, but I think it's working smoothly overall, she said. An estimated 49,000 people in Vermont are over 75. Officials estimate it will take about five weeks to give everyone in the category both the first and second shots. Then the focus will turn to people 70 and over, followed by those 65 and over. I believe the start of spring is a good projection for this, Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said when asked how quickly he felt those groups could be vaccinated. State officials are encouraging people to sign up online if they are able, even urging friends and relatives to help them.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The mayor has tested positive for the coronavirus. Mayor Levar M. Stoney said in a statement that he was informed of his positive test result Wednesday morning. Stoney said he began to experience mild COVID-19 symptoms Monday. He is isolating at home. And the people with whom he has been in contact are quarantining and taking other precautions. He said the pandemic is far from over and must be taken seriously. Since the coronavirus first started to spread in our region roughly a year ago, over 12,000 residents in our city have been infected with COVID-19. Today, I count myself as one of them, the mayor wrote. While I do not feel 100 percent, I am thankful that my symptoms are currently manageable and will continue to work from my home to ensure the continuity of city government. The mayor's annual State of the City address has been moved from this Thursday to Feb. 11. It will be delivered virtually. I look forward to sharing with all of you my vision for moving the city boldly forward in the coming year, and beyond, Stoney said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday touted big improvements in distributing COVID-19 vaccines, but he also urged residents to remain vigilant as new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus spread in the state. Inslee said more than 36,000 doses were administered in Washington on Sunday and 39,000 on Monday – a big jump from about 16,000 a week earlier and on the way toward the state's goal of 45,000 a day. The number of vaccines actually administered could be even higher, given lags in reporting, but as of Monday more than 500,000 doses had been administered statewide, with four mass vaccination sites due to open this week. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the federal government is boosting vaccine supplies to the states by 16% over the next three weeks, giving states more certainty about upcoming deliveries than the one-week notice the Trump administration had been providing. The shipments will also contain specially designed syringes to squeeze an additional dose out of vials of Pfizer vaccines. Still, problems persist, including that due to shortages many of the people now eligible for the vaccine, including everyone over 65, have had trouble finding appointments.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A judge on Tuesday denied an attempt by teachers unions to halt the state's decision to reopen classrooms last week amid the pandemic. Kanawha County Judge Carrie Webster denied a temporary restraining order that sought to reverse the resumption of in-person learning in all 55 counties. The two largest unions wanted local school boards to decide reopening plans and allow more teachers to get fully vaccinated before going back to teach. The West Virginia Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia had filed two separate lawsuits that were later consolidated. While we're disappointed with the decision, the judge did make a point of saying educators are at greater risk during this pandemic, Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said in a statement. Decisions to teach in-person, remotely, hybrid and online should be a local decision, made by those who are the most impacted and who best understand how to best educate students safely. The unions had said it is unsafe to put teachers and workers back in classrooms as coronavirus cases still climb.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will become one of only 10 in the U.S. without statewide mask mandates if the Assembly votes as scheduled Thursday to overturn Gov. Tony Evers' order, but masks will still be required in some of its largest cities thanks to local ordinances. More than two dozen public health organizations, as well as state and local health officials, have urged the Republican-controlled Legislature to reconsider the vote. Wearing masks is one of the pillars of recommendations from health experts worldwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with physically distancing and avoiding crowds. The move comes as Wisconsin lags in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, health officials warn about the spread of contagious new variants, and total deaths due to COVID-19 near 6,000. This is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said Tuesday. Vaccines alone won't stop the spread, she cautioned, noting the emergence of more contagious variants. Whether that mandate stands or not, everybody in our state, continue to wear a mask, to physically distance, she said, adding that it is not a bad idea to wear two masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new supercomputer in the state will rank among the world's fastest and help study phenomena including climate change, severe weather, wildfires and solar flares. Hewlett Packard Enterprise won a bid to provide the $35 million to $40 million machine for a supercomputing center in Cheyenne, the National Center for Atmospheric Research announced Wednesday. The HPE-Cray EX supercomputer will theoretically be able to perform almost 20 quadrillion calculations per second – 3.5 times faster than the existing machine at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center. The new machine's maximum speed per second will be roughly equivalent to each person on Earth completing a math equation every second for an entire month. That power will enable some of the most sophisticated simulations yet of large-scale natural and human-influenced events. It will support basic research in ways that will lead to more detailed and useful predictions of the world around us, thereby helping to make our society more resilient to increasingly costly disasters and contributing to improved human health and well-being, center Director Everette Joseph said in a news release. A contest among Wyoming schoolchildren will decide the new supercomputer's name.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and numerous other progressive Democrats have been appointed to the influential House Oversight and Reform committee, according to a Tuesday release from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOcasio-Cortez — who has emerged as the face of a new movement of young, liberal-leaning Democrats — is set to join the investigative committee that will serve as a check on the executive branch, Chairman Elijah E. Cummings said in the days following the 2018 midterm election.\n\nAmong the other progressive Democrats appointed to the committee: Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who grabbed headlines in January for using a profanity in her call to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nThe committee was ranked one of the most influential in Congress in 2014 by The Atlantic, which noted that the committee investigates allegations of fraud and abuse within the federal government.\n\nWhen asked about the outspoken nature of several new appointees to the committee, Cummings was dismissive, Politico reports: If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee.\n\nCalling the committee a powerful check on the Trump administration, Axios has gathered a list including dozens of potential subpoena targets for the committee.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing two Democratic congressional staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported in November that the committee would likely seek Trump's business tax returns and other company-related financial records.\n\nTrump's personal income taxes, which he withheld during the 2016 campaign and during his two years in office, were at that time expected to be sought by the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON – Roger Stone, a political operative whose work on Republican campaigns spans from Richard Nixon to President Donald Trump, has links to several targets of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nStone was arrested Friday after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of lying to Mueller's investigators.\n\nStone has been a pugnacious and longstanding force in GOP politics, allies say. His web site features pictures of him with Nixon and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnother link leads to a 2008 New Yorker profile, which said he regularly cross(es) the line between respectability and ignominy. The profile featured a picture of his tattoo of Nixon on his back.\n\nStone has worked for decades for a variety of Republican campaigns. During the 1980s, he was a partner in a political consulting firm with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, another key figure in the Mueller investigation. Manafort, who worked for Trump's campaign from March to August 2016, has been convicted on a variety of bank, tax and witness-tampering charges.\n\nThe Stone indictment contains seven counts: five charges of false statements, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstruction.\n\nThe allegations revolve around Stone's alleged contacts with WikiLeaks, the organization that released thousands of emails about Democrats during the 2016 election in an effort to damage Trump opponent Hillary Clinton. Stone is charged with lying to the House Intelligence Committee during its Russia investigation and trying to conceal emails and other records the committee had requested.\n\nI intend to fight for my life, Stone told Alex Jones during an interview Friday on InfoWars.com.\n\nStone said he was calling the show after being released on $250,000 bond after being arrested at his home about 6 a.m.\n\nThey would like me to plead guilty to charges that are completely bogus, Stone said. There is no Russian collusion. There is no Wikileaks collaboration.\n\nThe indictment makes repeated references to Trump's campaign but doesn't accuse the president himself or other officials of wrongdoing.\n\n'Payload is coming'\n\nIn the summer of 2016, according to the indictment, a senior official on Trump's campaign was directed to contact Stone to learn about any other damaging information the organization had on Clinton's campaign.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, according to the indictment, Stone emailed an unnamed person involved with the campaign to give them a heads-up about another release of information: Spoke to my friend in London last night, he wrote, a reference to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The payload is still coming.\n\nStone previously acknowledged he is likely the unnamed person in last year's indictment of Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking Democratic computers.\n\nOne Stone aide during the campaign, Andrew Miller, is fighting in federal appeals court to avoid a subpoena to testify before Mueller's grand jury. Another Stone associate, Jerome Corsi, has said he expects to be indicted for perjury.\n\nBut Stone insisted throughout the probe that he did nothing illegal. In a tweet on Oct. 23, Stone said that he didn't communicate with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and didn't receive emails allegedly hacked from Democratic computers.\n\nThe answer is no, Stone said.\n\nA Virginia jury convicted Manafort in August of eight counts of bank and tax fraud for not reporting millions in income. His sentencing is scheduled Feb. 8. Manafort also pleaded guilty in September to a conspiracy representing a pro-Russia faction in Ukraine and failing to report it, and obstructing justice by seeking to have witnesses provide inaccurate accounts to prosecutors.\n\nTrump adviser\n\nStone said he quit the Trump campaign in August 2015 after Trump suggested a television interviewer was menstruating. But Stone, who graduated from John Jay High School in Westchester County, New York, in 1970, remained an informal adviser to Trump and lingered on the periphery of the campaign.\n\nMueller's team charged a group of Russian military intelligence officers in July with hacking into computers of the Democratic National Committee and nominee Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Tens of thousands of emails and other documents were released online under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.\n\nThe indictment was revealed days before Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.\n\nThe indictment said Guccifer 2.0 wrote to a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump on or about Aug. 15, 2016, asking if the person found anyt(h)ing interesting in the docs I posted?\n\nStone has said he thinks he is the unnamed person in the indictment, but that the contact was benign.
AP\n\nHENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Oakland Raiders came one step closer to securing the land the team needs for its new headquarters and practice facility near Las Vegas — and at a steep discount.\n\nOfficials in suburban Henderson approved a resolution Tuesday that allows the city to move forward with a direct sale of 55 acres (22 hectares) to the Raiders for more than $6 million — half the land's appraised value. The city is using a Nevada law that allows for no-bid sales at under-market prices when they are considered to be in the public interest.\n\nThis is an opportunity to take the city of Henderson to a new level, Assistant City Manager Greg Blackburn said during the city council meeting ahead of the resolution vote. It's hard to put a dollar value to what this does to help us for the future.\n\nThe Raiders have promised that the venue will create an estimated 250 full-time jobs not counting players. The team will spend about $75 million to build the complex.\n\nThe team wants to kick off its 2020 season at a 65,000-seat domed stadium built partially with taxpayers' money across the freeway from the Las Vegas Strip. The team in May paid $77.5 million for the 62-acre (25-hectare) site and hosted a glitzy groundbreaking ceremony in November.\n\nGuests of hotels and other lodging facilities in the Las Vegas area are contributing $750 million to the project through a room tax increase. The Raiders and the NFL are expected to contribute $500 million to the project, while the team has also secured a $600 million bank loan for construction.\n\nHenderson's city council must vote again next month to give final approval to the offer.\n\nHenderson officials said the city will benefit from property taxes collected on the land and additional spending from visitors and team clients. City staff said similar projects have created an estimated $210 million tax impact over a decade after the venues are fully built.\n\nNot all residents were supportive of the city's decision.\n\nThe Raiders have been Gypsies over the years, starting in Oakland, then moving to El Segundo (LA) for a few years, then back to Oakland and now Las Vegas. Where to next? Henderson resident Adrian Woodhouse wrote the city council in an email.\n\nOn Wednesday, commissioners in Clark County approved a development agreement with the team that spells out public safety and infrastructure improvements that the Raiders will pay for in and around the stadium.\n\nThe agreement calls for widening sidewalks, improving roadways, installing and modifying traffic signals, and building any needed pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe team agreed to install about $1.4 million worth of public safety equipment at the stadium and an emergency operations center. The development agreement did not include a finalized plan for the thousands of county-mandated parking spaces.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that officials in Henderson, Nevada, approved the resolution Tuesday.

Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner used to be every player and agent's favorite in the game of baseball, doling out contracts beyond their wildest dreams, refusing to let money become a deterrent to winning a World Series championship.\n\nThe game no longer has the late New York Yankees owner, whose old team has not spent a penny in the free-agent market this winter, but, we now have Mike Ilitch.\n\nIlitch, 86, who has owned the Detroit Tigers since 1992, refuses to leave God's green earth until he has a World Series ring on his finger.\n\nJustin Upton, Detroit Tigers agree to six-year, $132.75 million deal\n\nIlitch struck late again by instructing his front office to exceed baseball's luxury tax barrier of $189 million for the first time in franchise history, and signing free agent outfielder Justin Upton on Monday evening to a six-year, $132.75 million contract.\n\nThe deal will be officially announced at Comerica Park on Wednesday afternoon, after he undergoes his physical in the morning.\n\nThe Tigers have now spent $272.25 million this year on free agents, more than any team in baseball with the exception of the Chicago Cubs. It's $42 million more than the Boston Red Sox, and $272.25 million more than the Yankees.\n\nThey became only the second team in MLB history, joining the Yankees, to sign two free agents to contracts exceeding $100 million, after acquiring starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann in November.\n\nI'm telling them, 'You have to go out and get me the best players,'' Ilitch said at the Zimmermann press conference. I don't care about the money. I want the best players, and that's it.''\n\nThere are no questions about commitment in Detroit, but instead, whether this will actually translate into that coveted title.\n\nThe Tigers have a beast of a lineup with all-world hitter Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez, J.D. Martinez and Upton. No team in baseball has a more imposing lineup. Yes, they are all right-handed except for switch hitting Victor Martinez, but they are lethal no matter whether the pitcher throws the ball with his right hand or his left.\n\nWhy, Upton has a career .805 OPS against right-handed pitching, including .848 last season. He hit 23 of his 26 homers against right-handers. Cabrera hit a major-league leading .344 against right-handed pitching last year. J.D. Martinez his .286 with 28 homers off righties.\n\nThe Tigers' lineup will be even more powerful than ever with Upton, 28, who truly believes the best is yet to come. It's why Upton and his agent, Larry Reynolds, refused to settle for a short-term contract. They had faith all along that someone could see his value, and realize that if surrounded by greatness, his potential would blossom.\n\nAfter all, Upton's 190 career home runs are more than any active player 28 years or younger, according to ESPN's Stats and Research. This will easily be the most talented lineup he's ever been part of in his career. We'll soon find out if it's also the best team.\n\nThe Houston Astros, Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers were the most aggressive teams coveting Upton, but he made it clear to all of them that if Jason Heyward was going to get $23 million a year from the Chicago Cubs, he should get awfully close considering the power he provides. Tigers GM Al Avila and manager Brad Ausmus, who went to Upton's home in Scottsdale, Ariz., last Friday to recruit him, came away agreeing with him.\n\nYoenis Cespedes should cash in after Upton's huge deal\n\nUpton will earn $21.25 million every year in his deal, with an opt-out clause after two years, and a full no-trade provision.\n\nIlitch, of course, hopes that within those two years, whether Upton opts out or not, he'll have a World Series ring.\n\nThe future, everyone understands, is now for the Tigers.\n\nThis is a team that has four of their star players who will be 33 or older this season: DH Victor Martinez (37), closer Francisco Rodriguez (34), Cabrera (33) and Justin Verlander (33).\n\nIt's not as if their aging stars about to depart anytime, either, resulting in a bloated future payroll. Cabrera is signed for $240 million through 2023. Verlander has $112 million remaining through 2019. Martinez is owed $54 million through 2018. And Zimmermann, who will be 30 in May, is owed $110 million through 2020.\n\nThe Tigers have committed about $117 million to five players alone in 2018, but now, they have a young star to help supplant their aging stars.\n\nBesides, the Upton signing did nothing to hurt their future or farm system. The Tigers, who were protected because they had one of the 10 worst records in the major leagues last season (74-87) lost only a third-round pick by signing Upton, after losing a second-round pick with the signing of Zimmermann.\n\nHe also eliminates any holes in the Tigers' current lineup, enabling the Tigers to use Anthony Gose in center field with Cameron Maybin.\n\nWho knows if the Tigers have enough to knock off the defending World Series champion Kansas City Royals, but at least now they have a chance.\n\nThey've significantly upgraded their team after also signing starter Mike Pelfrey to a two-year, $16 million deal, signing shortstop Mike Aviles and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and trading for Maybin. Perhaps most important, they rebuilt their bullpen, which ranked 27th last season with a 4.38 ERA, with the acquisitions of closer Francisco Rodriguez, and setup men Mark Lowe and Justin Wilson.\n\nIlitch, who has watched his team reach the World Series twice during his tenure, and win four consecutive AL Central titles, now is giving his team one more shot. The window is closing, and Ilitch is aging, but the Tigers now have as great an opportunity as anyone in the American League.\n\nIlitch has four Stanley Cup championship rings as owner of the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHe might be willing to give them all up for that World Series ring.\n\nIt's all,'' Ilitch said, I think about.''\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale
Drawing up a list of financial resolutions for the new year isn't the routine exercise it once was. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed that, as it has altered so many other behaviors.\n\nIt's not just a matter of plotting the usual ways to save more money, cut debt or re-evaluate your spending patterns – this year's three most popular money resolutions, according to Fidelity Investments' 2021 New Year Financial Resolutions survey. Rather, the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial pressures it has caused have brought a new sense of urgency to some goals, while posing different challenges and presenting new opportunities.\n\nEvaluate spending, budget\n\nBudgeting, for example, ranks as a top financial resolution year in and year out. But this time, things are a bit different because the pandemic changed spending patterns for many people. If you review how you spent money over the past year or two, you likely can spot key differences and perhaps areas for improvement.\n\nShipping deluge:Delays in holiday deliveries, delays in returns, plague small businesses\n\nChild labor and Girl Scout cookies:Palm oil industry in Southeast Asia tied to cookies, plus other snacks, breakfast cereals\n\nFor example, you're probably not driving as much anymore so you might not need a car to the same extent. Maybe you don't need to buy as many clothes, especially for work, or perhaps you're spending much less on entertainment and restaurants. Most likely, you cut back big time on travel. Maybe you can reduce these expenditures permanently.\n\nMake an inventory of what you did in 2020, and use it as a roadmap for 2021, suggested Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner and adviser for Splitit, a site that helps people make interest-free purchases on installment. Our definition of needs and wants has changed so much.\n\nAssess your insurance needs\n\nYou might have noticed that you don't require the same types or levels of protection as before. Auto insurance is an obvious example, now that more people are working or studying at home. That has meant fewer cars are on the road, with a sharp reduction in vehicle accidents and better insurance deals.\n\nThe staggering drop in accidents this year resulted in a dramatic drop in claims paid by insurers, said the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Economic Justice in a recent review of accident statistics.\n\nThe groups want to see insurers lower premiums – and many have. It thus might be a good time to evaluate your insurance needs with an eye on shopping around.\n\nConversely, you might need more home-insurance coverage, or different types, if your dwelling has risen in value, you recently completed remodeling projects or you set up a new home-based business.\n\nCancel unneeded subscriptions\n\nWhile you're looking at spending, take the time to evaluate your various subscriptions, memberships and other accounts with an eye on eliminating those you no longer use, said Rebell. Look to cancel automated, recurring payments whether tied to your bank account, cellphone or other accounts if you rarely use those services anymore.\n\nCancellations don't need to be permanent and might bring about a better deal. If you change your mind, you can always resubscribe to a service and might receive a coupon, introductory rate or discount for doing so, Rebell added. Also, look to reduce paper clutter by signing up for email statements where possible.\n\nThese and other moves to get more organized weren't necessitated by the pandemic, but you might now finally have the time to get it all done.\n\nPlan for an unreliable tax refund\n\nMany Americans still haven't built up an emergency fund, and the COVID-19 outbreak with widespread job losses didn't help. But there could be a special need to accumulate a cash cushion now because you probably can't count on your annual income-tax refund arriving with as much predictability as in the past.\n\nTax refunds are the largest chunk of change many Americans receive all year and a key source of funds to pay down credit card balances and so on. But office-shutting measures to control the virus slowed tax-return processing and the issuance of some refunds by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTaxpayers shouldn't rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills, the IRS warned in December. Some tax returns may require additional review, and processing may take longer.\n\nThe IRS said it already expects that refunds tied to the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit won't be issued before mid-February.\n\nMaintain online vigilance\n\nThe IRS and other entities have warned of an uptick in cyber scams tied to stimulus payments, coronavirus-relief measures and the like. Given that many of these federal and state programs are new, it's easy to get confused. Plus, more people are shopping online amid the COVID-19 outbreak, raising the odds of falling victim.\n\nHence the need to stay alert. Among key points: Be skeptical about offers from unfamiliar companies, avoid clicking on attachments and be wary of unsolicited messages from tax authorities such as the IRS, which doesn't initiate contact this way.\n\nAlso, take the opportunity to change passwords to lessen the odds of having an account hacked. Americans don't change their passwords often. Nor do they utilize complex, lengthy passwords. Password manager NordPass said it determined this by examining 275 million passwords, with the help of a data-breach security firm. Of those, only 44% were unique.\n\nThe 2020 list of most common passwords was similar to those from 2019. For example, the numerical string 123456 was near the top both years. Other common ones include password, picture1, 111111, qwerty and abc123.\n\nReview all your online accounts and delete those you no longer use, NordPass suggests. Favor passwords that are unique, complicated and long.\n\nInvest in yourself\n\nEven before COVID-19 arrived, many Americans found that their job and financial-literacy skills were lacking. Now might be a good time to take courses or make other personal improvements, especially as so much of this can be done online.\n\nWhile people usually think of financial resolutions in terms of saving more or cutting debt, learning and earning more also are important, noted Dana Anspach, a certified financial planner with Sensible Money in Scottsdale, Arizona. Learning is the foundation of both making smarter investment decisions and increasing your earning power, she said.\n\nAs with any resolution, Anspach said it's critical to devise a plan to make it happen by defining actionable steps and putting them on a calendar, now. Other helpful tips include having a mentor or accountability buddy and following a course of action for at least three to four weeks, until the new behavior becomes routine.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.
NASHVILLE — Can you picture a fastball coming off the hand of a New York Yankees pitcher and hear the crack of it being hit by a Nashville batter?\n\nCan you see that ball sailing over the fence, then gaze beyond the outfield seats and across the Cumberland River at the downtown skyline of the Music City?\n\nJohn Loar, a 59-year-old businessman who moved here from the San Francisco Bay area about six months ago, can. He has a vision for a Major League Baseball franchise playing in a 42,000-seat stadium located on the East Bank.\n\nAnd he has a plan to make it happen.\n\nI think Major League Baseball is going to expand, and it's going to be either Charlotte or Nashville, he said. If you really want to have baseball, you've got to start now.\n\nSome civic leaders are skeptical.\n\nAnd although Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred last summer named Nashville as one of six cities the league is considering for future expansion, Loar has not met with him.\n\nIt's not clear whether Nashville could support a baseball team in addition to the Titans, the Predators and an upcoming Major League Soccer franchise. Nashville would need to build a new stadium, fill seats for 81 games per year and find corporate sponsors.\n\nHow it all started\n\nManfred caught Nashville by surprise when he dropped the city's name during a television interview last July at the MLB All-Star Game. He also mentioned Portland, Las Vegas and Charlotte, as well as Montreal and Vancouver in Canada.\n\nI was probably as surprised as anybody to read that coming from the commissioner, said Butch Spyridon, CEO of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., but I also would say that means he's been paying attention.\n\nNashville's success in hosting the 2016 NHL All-Star Game and the excitement of tens of thousands of fans flooding Lower Broadway for the 2017 Stanley Cup Final made the sports world take notice.\n\nThen Nashville was awarded the 2019 NFL draft.\n\nIt's a big event city, it's a great sports city when you look what we've been doing the past few years, the history of the Titans and the warm reception for soccer, said Predators CEO Sean Henry.\n\nA real estate developer who also has a background in sports and entertainment business, Loar says he was contracted — a non-disclosure agreement prevents him from saying by whom — in 2017 to analyze several cities as possible locations for a major league franchise. Nashville was one of those cities.\n\nI think Nashville is one of the hottest markets in the country — I'm not the only one saying that — and it's become a tourist destination. There's a reason to come here, he said.\n\nThe Las Vegas model\n\nThe metropolitan area has more than 1.9 million residents, according to 2017 U.S. Census estimates, ranking it 36th in the country. That's larger than Milwaukee, the smallest current MLB market, yet smaller than expansion contenders Portland, Charlotte and Las Vegas.\n\nMusic City has an edge in the television market. The Nielsen Company's fall 2018 numbers rate Nashville as the 27th-largest TV market.\n\nIn 2018, the Nashville Sounds Triple-A team attracted more than 600,000 — an average of 8,741 fans per game — to rank fourth in minor league attendance, according to Ballpark Digest.\n\nWe're proud of what we have accomplished, said Adam Nuse, the Sounds' general manager, but that's at the minor league level. Taking that next step is yet to be seen.\n\nMLB games averaged an attendance of 28,830 last season.\n\nSonny Gray, former Smyrna High and Vanderbilt star who pitches for the New York Yankees, said the city is big enough.\n\nIt has turned into a big city, and people love baseball around here, he said. Nashville has never been more ready for a major league team than it is now.\n\nJudging by how they have embraced the Predators and Titans, a Music City major league team could count on support from newcomers to the area.\n\nI came here from (Washington) D.C. and there's no major league team here, so I'm a (Nationals) fan, said Brian Kelley, a military retiree who moved to Nashville five years ago. I made the switch from the Capitals to the Predators, I made the switch from the Steelers to the Titans. I'm willing to switch.\n\nNashville also attracts about 15 million visitors per year.\n\nThis is one of the top tourist destinations in the country, and you want to tap into that, Loar said. If you're going to continue to build hotels, 81 (home games) a year can help fill those.\n\nLas Vegas has a successful hockey franchise and will add an NFL team in 2020 when the Oakland Raiders relocate. Those teams will rely on high rollers as much as local residents to fill seats. Loar wants to replicate that for baseball in Nashville.\n\nIt's the Las Vegas model, he said, without the gambling.\n\nCan Nashville afford another stadium?\n\nThe city has committed $275 million to build a 30,500-seat stadium at Fairgrounds Nashville for its new soccer team. Metro government spent $91 million in 2015 to build the Sounds' First Tennessee Park — a 10,000-seat stadium that can't be expanded to major league proportions.\n\nMayor David Briley told Loar during a 2018 meeting that no public funds would be available to bring baseball to Nashville.\n\nOur focus remains on our number one priority, getting our MLS team ready, said Thomas Mulgrew, a spokesman for the mayor.\n\nThat doesn't dissuade Loar.\n\nThe how to do that is it needs to be a real estate master plan community development, Loar said.\n\nHis plan includes a stadium and a mixed-use development on property near Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL's Titans. The two stadiums could then share parking lots.\n\nLoar notes a city-commissioned study shows the Titans' stadium needs nearly $300 million in capital improvements. He said spending that much on a facility that hosts eight home games per year along with a similar number of concerts or other events makes for a low return on investment. Baseball's big home schedule would increase traffic to the area.\n\nI think this may be a complementary use where potentially you could benefit in the long term to help the Titans accomplish their objectives, Loar said, and also bring Major League Baseball here and kind of find a way to pay for it using the back end tax revenues that exist.\n\nAn alternative site could be the PSC Metals scrap yard on the East Bank.\n\nThe whole flood plain along the East Bank makes a lot of sense, Spyridon said. There's a lot of real estate. There's a lot of interest. There are people that have compiled acres and acres of land, and then there's that obvious eyesore of the scrap yard.\n\nGov. Bill Lee hasn't met with Loar but supports the idea of bringing another professional sports franchise to the state.\n\nI think when we look at any potential significant employer that's coming into our state and is going to bring economic activity, we would look at incentive packages, he said.\n\nFinding corporate dollars\n\nA stadium needs a corporate sponsor to pay big money for naming rights, but baseball requires much more to thrive.\n\nYou've got to have a lot of big companies that buy 30 and 40 season tickets, said Farrell Owens, who was general manager for the Sounds in their first five seasons.\n\nSpyridon isn't convinced the city's corporate profile is ready for the demands of a baseball franchise.\n\nThat's always been the Achilles' heel for the market, he said. But that's starting to change with AllianceBernstein and Ernst & Young and certainly Amazon. So we're getting stronger, but we've got to have a significant base to support, in particular, for baseball — long season, lot of suite sales and a lot of signage.\n\nHenry thinks there's enough to go around.\n\nI always bristle at that, he said. It's on the teams to make that happen. Whether we're one of the biggest cities or small cities for corporate headquarters is almost secondary: It's your job to reach out and get them to engage with you.\n\nThe Titans wouldn't stand in the way. We have been part of the growth of Nashville as a sports town over the last 20-plus years and we wouldn't put any limits on is ceiling, the Titans said in a statement.\n\nBringing in heavy hitters\n\nThis isn't Loar's first attempt to acquire a major league ball club. In 2012, he worked with Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa as part of a group's failed bid to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. Five years later, he was involved with a failed bid to purchase the Miami Marlins.\n\nLoar said the next step is a feasibility study. He also has assembled an advisory board that includes Dave Stewart, a former World Series MVP.\n\nLoar also wants the Music City's entertainment community on board. He can count country star Vince Gill among those who want to see it happen.\n\nI think we're poised for it, said Gill, who played baseball growing up in Oklahoma. The city's on fire. I think it would be a home run.\n\nWe've got football and hockey and soccer. We're as big a city as St. Louis, we're as big a city as Milwaukee and a bunch of cities that have teams, so I don't see why we couldn't.\n\nVanderbilt baseball coach TIm Corbin is also on Loar's advisory board.\n\nThere's a lot of foundations that have to be built in order for it to happen, he said. The size of the city and where it's going, I think in time that's a real possibility.\n\nGrassroots support for baseball\n\nSkip Nipper is secretary of the Nashville Old Timers Baseball Association. He opened the Twitter account @mlb_nashville last April, before the commissioner mentioned the possibility of the big leagues coming to town.\n\nI started it on a whim to see if there was interest, he said. I just did it because I'm a baseball historian and I wanted to see if there was another opportunity to get information out about how important it is for Major League Baseball to come to Nashville.\n\nLoar believes the MLB expansion will come within the next five to seven years. The league says it won't consider adding teams until it solves local stadium issues in Tampa and Oakland, which raises the possibility that either of those franchises could relocate.\n\nWhat I'm hoping to accomplish is to have the people in Nashville and the surrounding communities just take a step back and really try to make in their own minds a determination whether they can envision Major League Baseball here and whether it would be good for the city, he said. If it is, how do we get there?\n\nNipper is skeptical, but he likes the idea.\n\nI hope I live long enough for that, he said.\n\nMANFRED SPEAKS: MLB commissioner names Nashville a potential expansion city\n\nCOLORFUL HISTORY: History of baseball at Sulphur Dell\n\nErik Bacharach, Joseph Garrison, Jamie Munks and Mike Organ contributed to this report.

And why wouldn't we suspect that the scammers would be tapping into all the buzz about the latest round of stimulus cash?\n\nNow, the Federal Trade Commission is warning Americans to be on the lookout for stimulus-related emails that supposedly are being sent by Joseph Simons, the FTC chairman who resigned Jan. 29.\n\nIn the past year, about 324,000 reports relating to COVID-19 and stimulus-related scams and ripoffs have been made to the FTC through Jan. 18. Consumers reported losing $307 million to fraud that plays up the pandemic.\n\nThe latest coronavirus relief scam involves emails that are designed to look as if they're coming from an official government agency, and Simons specifically.\n\nJoe Simons isn't emailing you; it's a scam.\n\nThe email includes a certificate of approval for your stimulus cash.\n\nThe scam demands that you pay taxes upfront to receive the money.\n\nRecently widowed? Here's what you need to know about Social Security survivors benefits\n\nTrying to pay off debt? Here are 4 mistakes to avoid when doing that.\n\nThe FTC noted that sometimes the scam involves a follow-up but fake letter from the IRS to make the deal seem that much more legitimate.\n\nIf you pay, according to an FTC alert, they say you must pay the State Department for a certificate that proves the funds are not related to any terrorist activity and the money is cleared for you to receive. (Yes, really!)\n\nAnd you'll even get some phony paperwork to show that the stimulus money is on its way to your bank account, if you fall for the scam and pay some reported taxes upfront.\n\nRed flags of a stimulus scam\n\nOne red flag: The Economic Impact Payments being sent by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department are not taxable.\n\nAnother red flag: You do not have to pay money upfront via gift cards or anything else to receive the stimulus cash.\n\nAnd yet another red flag: The FTC isn't involved in the stimulus payments in any way.\n\nAgain, the IRS isn't sending out emails, texting or making phone calls about the latest round of stimulus payments, which began being paid out Dec. 30. But scammers can rig up a caller ID to make a phone call look like it's from the IRS or another government agency.\n\nSome reports indicate that text scam might promise that the latest $600 stimulus check will be sent directly to your bank account – only if you click on a link, text back or email your bank account information. Don't do it.\n\nYou can go to IRS.gov/coronavirus for information about stimulus payments.\n\nDon't fall for any scammer who says they know a secret on how to get that stimulus payment by filing a tax return either. The Recovery Rebate Credit is on all 1040 forms and it's not a secret strategy. It's on Line 30.\n\nA variety of scams are likely to crop up and play off the stimulus money. The schemes are crafted to get your cash or your key personal information, such as Social Security account information, bank account numbers or passwords.\n\nYou might see something like a text message that asks for your bank account number so that that the Economic Impact Payment can be directly deposited into your account. Don't fall for it. The IRS isn't sending out those emails.\n\nYou can report such fraud at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.\n\nHow crooks are targeting small businesses\n\nFraudsters also are cranking out emails that claim to come from the Small Business Administration Office of Disaster Assistance.\n\nMore:Rising cases of COVID-19 stock scams threaten investors\n\nMore:Medicare scams and marketing tricks heat up as sign-up deadline approaches\n\nThe pitch is that you're pre-approved for a loan valued at up to $250,000.\n\nThe program reportedly provides low interest disaster loans to businesses of all sizes, private nonprofit organizations, homeowners, and renters to repair or replace real estate, personal property, machinery and equipment, inventory and business assets that have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nOf course, the email asks for your Social Security number and other key ID that crooks love to use to take out loans in your name.\n\nThe FTC notes that phony websites are pretending to be part of the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, which has been extended to Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nSome small business owners also report that they've been asked to repay loans they didn't apply for last year. It's possible that crooks illegally applied for the loans using stolen ID information.\n\nHow scammers want you to 'pay' taxes\n\nAs the tax season moves forward, consumers also need to be warned about other scams, too.\n\nNow that many people have a bit more money, if they've received their latest stimulus check, they could be willing to take care of some old bills.\n\nCon artists will impersonate the Internal Revenue Service and a variety of state tax departments to get you to pay up on back taxes.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Treasury warned in January that an aggressive scam has begun to target consumers in northern Michigan.\n\nThe letter has a heading that reads: Call Immediately to Prevent Property Loss.\n\nThe scheme focuses on your overdue tax bill, demanding that you call a toll-free number immediately to take care of this state tax debt.\n\nThe letter aggressively threatens to seize a taxpayer's property – including bank accounts, wages, business assets, cars, real estate and cash – if the debt is not settled, the Treasury stated.\n\nOver the last week, we have seen an uptick in reports of taxpayers receiving these letters, Deputy State Treasurer Ann Good, who oversees Treasury's Financial and Administrative Services programs, said in a statement.\n\nTaxpayers have rights. If you have questions about an outstanding state tax debt, please contact us through a verified number so we can talk about options.\n\nDon't react simply because a letter might seem to know how much you owe in back taxes. Such information can be pulled by scammers from public databases.\n\nDon't rush to pay anyone. You don't want to think you're clearing up a financial mess only to find out that you handed over your hard earned cash to a crook.
Sam Stebbins and Michael B. Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nFalling gasoline prices have, at least temporarily, slowed the improvement in the average fuel efficiency of cars Americans choose to buy. Since reaching a peak of 25.8 miles per gallon (mpg) in August of 2014, the average fuel economy of new cars sold in the U.S. market dropped to 25 mpg this past November, according to researchers at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.\n\nMethodology: To identify the cars with the worst gas mileage, 24/7 Wall St. used data on estimated combined city and highway miles per gallon from the EPA. We only reviewed 2015 and 2016 models and used data on the 2016 model when available. We further screened by eliminating any duplicate models, opting for the model and trim with the worst mpg. If multiple trim levels of the same model have the same fuel efficiency, we only looked at one model.\n\n7 States Where Americans Are Moving\n\nManufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) data came from third-party sources, when not available from the manufacturer. The vehicle's specifications came from the EPA's reports. Gas-guzzler data came from the EPA's most recent (2013) report on which vehicles are exempt from the tax and the EPA's overview of the gas-guzzler tax.\n\nThese are the cars with the worst fuel efficiency.\n\n10. Mercedes-Benz, G550\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.4\n\n> MSRP: $120,825\n\nMercedes-Benz has been building the G550 for 36 years, and chances are the vehicle will celebrate its 40th year anniversary before the automaker decides to move on. For 2016, the SUV got a peppier and more fuel efficient engine. Despite the improvement, it is among the least fuel efficient vehicles on the market, getting an average 13.4 mpg. The G550 weighs 5,724 pounds, and the 4-liter, 416-horsepower engine can push that weight from 0 to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.\n\n9. Pagani, Huayra Coupe\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.2\n\n> MSRP: $1.07 million\n\nA boutique carmaker, Pagani has been selling hand-made cars for 14 years at a rate of less than 10 cars per year. The Italian automaker built the first of 100 Huayras in 2013, and even at around $1 million per vehicle, it sold all the cars. The Huayra, which can zip from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.0 seconds, has a top speed is 224 mph. The Coupe version sacrifices efficiency for speed as it gets an average 13.2 mpg.\n\n100 Largest Private Companies\n\n8. Ferrari, F12\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.1\n\n> MSRP: $490,000\n\nFerrari plans to build only 799 units of the F12tdf. Named to honor the Tour de France auto race of the 1950s and 60s, the special edition was announced in October and sold out in a month. One of the fastest cars ever sold, the F12 accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in a mere 2.7 seconds and sports a 211 mph top speed. Though it gets an average of only 13.1 mpg, it still has better fuel economy than its slightly less expensive cousin, the Ferrari FF.\n\n7. Lamborghini, Veneno Roadster\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.8\n\n> MSRP: $4.5 million\n\nThose who spend $4.5 million on a single automobile are paying for exclusivity as much as anything else. Lamborghini hand-crafted just nine Veneno roadsters — and all nine are already sold. The company claims a top speed of 221 mph for the Veneno and it accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds.\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\n100 Largest Private Companies\n\n6. Ferrari, FF\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.8\n\n> MSRP: $302,450\n\nThe EPA rates the FF as a midsize car — in the same class as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry — because Ferrari offers it in a 4-seater version. Introduced in 2011, the FF of course is a high-end vehicle and one of the most expensive on the U.S. market, with an MSRP of around $300,000. The 12-cylinder engine generates 651 horsepower, and the car goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 208 mph.\n\n5. Lamborghini, Aventador Roadster\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.2\n\n> MSRP: $550,000 (estimated)\n\nLamborghini's supercar Aventador has been in production since the 2012 model year. The 750-4 SV roadster uses a similar V-12 engine to the Veneno, and like the Veneno, the car goes from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds with a top speed of 217 mph. The car is slightly less fuel efficient, however, gets an EPA rating of 12.2 mpg combined city and highway.\n\n4. GMC, Savana 2500 2WD Conversion Cargo\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.9\n\n> MSRP: $32,410\n\nSome of the vehicles on this list are luxury vehicles, with automakers often sacrificing fuel efficiency for performance and luxury. The GMC Savana 2500 2WD is not such a vehicle. The Savana is a work vehicle, offered as a passenger van and as a utility vehicle for hauling cargo. Although a version of the van has been sold for roughly two decades, the years of production have not yielded a more fuel-efficient cargo van. The Savana 2500 gets just 15 mpg on the highway and 10 mpg in the city.\n\n3. Chevrolet, Express 2500 2WD Conversion Cargo\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.9\n\n> MSRP: $30,550\n\nThe Chevrolet Express is mechanically identical to the GMC Savana — GM sells the same car under different names. Like the Savana, the Express focuses on effectively hauling cargo — at the apparent expense of fuel efficiency. The Express 2500 has 270 cubic feet of cargo space and is rated to haul 8,600 pounds of cargo.\n\n2. Mercedes-Benz, AMG G65\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.6\n\n> MSRP: $218,825\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G65 traces its roots back to 1979, when it was designed as an off-road vehicle for military use. Eventually, the car gained tremendous appeal in the civilian consumer market. Since the original car was released, the German automaker has added some creature comforts and tailored the vehicle to the high-end market. Perhaps its roots as primarily a utility vehicle explain its incredibly low fuel efficiency of 11 mpg in the city, and 13 mpg on the highway.\n\nMost Dangerous States to Drive\n\n1. Bugatti, Veyron\n\n> Miles per gallon: 10.4\n\n> MSRP: $2.25 million\n\nBuilt by luxury automaker Bugatti, the Veyron is one of the fastest cars in the world, capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 254.04 mph. That is what a 16-cylinder, quad-turbocharged engine that generates 1,200-horsepower can achieve. Speed, however, does not typically translate into efficiency. The car gets just 10.4 mpg combined combined fuel economy. After marking its 10-year anniversary this year, production of the Veyron ceased, with a final production run of 450.\n\nSee the rest of the top 20 cars with the worst mileage:\n\nCars With the Worst Gas Mileage\n\nMore on the cars with the worst gas mileage\n\nThe recent Volkswagen TDI scandal — in which it came to light that the German manufacturer intentionally misrepresented the fuel efficiency of its diesel vehicles — highlights the importance of fuel efficiency to Americans, even in times like now, as gas prices are at a multi-year low. Much of the decrease in overall fuel economy is attributable to higher sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, cars that burn more fuel than smaller, lighter vehicles. Other extremely low efficiency luxury models continue to reach high-end buyers as well. The Bugatti Veyron gets roughly 15 miles per gallon on the highway and 8 miles per gallon in the city. Based on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 20 cars with the worst gas mileage sold in the U.S.\n\nThe manufacturers or importers of most vehicles with a fuel economy below 22.5 mpg are assessed a gas-guzzler tax. Pickup trucks and SUVs are exempt from the tax because of a concern on the impact such a tax would have on farmers and construction companies.\n\nIf a car is considered a gas-guzzler when getting less than 22.5 mpg, a car getting less than 15 mpg certainly has to offer buyers extra special features to justify the lost fuel efficiency. In the majority of cases, what is being offered is extreme luxury or performance or both.\n\nOf the 20 cars with the worst fuel efficiency, 14 cost at least $100,000, and four cost at least $500,000. Included on this list of low-efficiency vehicles are so-called hypercars such as the Lamborghini Aventador and the Ferrari FF. These vehicles are built to achieve peak speed and acceleration. Fuel efficiency is an afterthought.\n\nThe remainder of the cars with the worst fuel efficiency are built on light truck frames. Two are SUVs, two are large vans, and two are pickups. In all six cases, potential owners must choose to sacrifice fuel efficiency in order to gain utility.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Sid Mohasseb\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe Gamestop debacle this week has reminded us of Biden's most important mission: to fix capitalism, and make it work for Main Street as well as Wall Street.\n\nBy doing this he can connect with two opposing camps and become a President for all Americans: on one side he has the social justice wing of the Democrats, and on the other the Rust Belt Trump supporters. Both groups — in the Black Lives Matter protests and the storming of the Capitol respectively — have shown their willingness to engage in civil disobedience, or worse.\n\nBut both groups ultimately want the same thing: the return of the American Dream and the restoration of true capitalism, rather than the elitism that has become entrenched in the US. If Biden really wants to heal and unify America, he must restore it to what it used to be: A nation of innovators, who are all given a fair shot. An economy built not on trickle-down but bubble-up.\n\nDisease of lack of opportunity\n\nThe symptom may be anger, but the disease is lack of opportunity.\n\nSocial justice activists ask for dismantling the system and claim that those who benefit from the current system are the privileged. Although this may be symbolized by race or gender, the ultimate form of privilege and power is economics. The same is true of the far-right / QAnon groups. Although their anger may be directed against globalists, globalization is only a negative because it isn't working for them.\n\nIt's easy to see why they are angry. 90% of the children born in 1940 ended up in higher ranks of the income distribution than their parents, while only 40% of those born in 1980 have managed to do so. The average Americans' purchasing power has not budged in 40 years.\n\nMaking America great again should not be about trade wars, blind nationalism, or creating short-term jobs in outdated industries. Neither should it be about starving police - the guardians of an inequitable order - of funds, or creating chaos on the streets.\n\nWhat we need is to give everyone an equal opportunity to prosper. That is difficult when launching a quintessentially American mom-and-pop enterprise means competing with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. While big business is propped up by government policies, the mom-and-pop businesses are dying almost as quickly as their founders.\n\nIn 2015, Americans were far less likely to start a company than they were in the 1980s. Business collapse now outnumbers business birth for the first time since records began in the late 1970's — even though people have more tools to start and grow a business.\n\nThe profit motives that triggered globalization have critically wounded America's car production sector, displacing a whole demographic of rust-belt, blue collar workers. The average white family wealth is almost eight times that of minorities. They all want to live in an America where hard work, innovation and grit is enough to ascend the social ladder.\n\nBiden and American unity:Let's get real. Joe Biden, Democrats and America need results much more than unity.\n\nBut while America has stayed true to its roots of defying socialism, over the years under the umbrella of trickle-down economics, we have practiced it. We have let the big corporations grow bigger and then give the money - through jobs - to the masses, rather than let individuals create their own jobs through entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile the responsibility for mass economic prosperity was shifted to big corporations, their focus remained on profits and stock prices.\n\nThe cracks in the system have become even clearer in the past year — the GameStop debacle is just the clearest crack of them all.\n\nWhile the stock market has skyrocketed and individuals like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have grown their wealth by billions, poverty and joblessness has impacted millions — all while Silicon Valley has had one of its highest investment years ever.\n\nBiden has to kill the notion that innovation and its benefits are reserved for the Silicon Valley investors and take away the privilege big corporates and wealthy individuals have enjoyed as gatekeepers in charge of the trickling down of prosperity.\n\nAmerica — on the vocal left, the radical right and the silent middle — does not need handouts. It wants a helping hand up towards self-sufficiency.\n\nBiden must allow the American power of entrepreneurship to flourish\n\nBiden must put America first by unleashing its power of entrepreneurship and give true capitalism a fighting chance by using tax policies to provide incentives to small businesses who re-tool, retrain and automate.\n\nHe can fund this by plugging the tax loopholes for big players, and by incentivizing them to become 'entrepreneurial philanthropists' (eg. by giving grants to small businesses)\n\nRather than talking about forgiving student loans, let's find ways for young educated entrepreneurs to turn that debt into investments for new businesses.\n\nBiden:Will America buy into Joe Biden's plans for unity? Don't get your hopes up.\n\nLet's incentivize early-stage investors to transition from Silicon Valley type deals to more localized small businesses.\n\nLet's give banks and credit card companies incentives to shift funding to smaller companies, with possibly riskier profiles.\n\nLet's re-vitalize the funding provided by the likes of the Small Business Aadministration, Defense Advanced Research Pprojects Agency, the National Science Foundation and more.\n\nLet's stop delegating America's future to Wall Street and let's once again bet on Main Street. It's time to turn up the heat on the bubble-up economy and let it boil.\n\nSid Mohasseb is adjunct professor in dynamic data-driven strategy at the University of Southern California and is the former national strategic innovation leader for strategy at KPMG.

Evan Comen\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nGas prices fluctuate wildly in the United States. Many factors can cause price swings, from seasonal conditions, global market trends, an announcement from a nation's oil industry, to the development of a new extraction technology. Taxes are perhaps the least volatile aspect of gasoline prices, yet gas taxes vary between U.S. regions and largely account for the price differences between states.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the combined state and average local gas taxes per gallon in each state from estimates provided by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Pennsylvania leads the nation with a gas tax of 50.4 cents per gallon. In Alaska, the average gallon of gas is taxed at just 12.3 cents, the lowest in the nation.\n\nMichael Green, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association (AAA), explained that beyond the federal fuel tax, which is levied uniformly across the nation, states have free reign to determine how they will fund transportation projects within their states. Green added, It often comes down to local and state politics. For this reason, taxes vary considerably across the country.\n\nStates With the Highest (and Lowest) Gas Taxes\n\nIn the states with the highest gas taxes, the price of gasoline tends to be high even when taxes are excluded from the overall cost, while the opposite tends to be true in low gas tax states.\n\nThis is largely due to the proximity of oil refineries. In the Southeast, for example, where state governments levy low taxes on gas and drivers pay low gas prices, there is an abundant supply of oil. Texas and Louisiana are home to 27 and 19 petroleum refineries, respectively — the most and second most nationwide. Such states are also subject to fewer supplementary costs associated with the fuel, such as transportation costs or price spikes brought on by local supply shortages.\n\nTo fund roads and other transportation infrastructure, states with numerous oil refineries can often extract tax revenue from the production side of petroleum and spare consumers at the pump by charging relatively low retail gas taxes.\n\nFor states in the Northeast, by contrast, most fuel arrives by pipeline from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The transportation costs add to the overall price of gasoline. In addition, since many of these states do not have any refineries, there is also no opportunity to tax fuel at the production stage. Northeastern states, therefore, may levy relatively high gas taxes in order to make up for the lack of other sources of revenue.\n\nThe federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon and has remained unchanged since 1993. For the most part, revenues from gasoline sales are reinvested in transportation infrastructure. According to Green, however, States do not receive enough money from the federal government for transportation, and have enacted state fuel taxes as a means to supplement their funding needs. Almost all state gas tax rates match or exceed the federal tax rate, and in some cases double it.\n\nThe Richest County in Each State\n\nGas taxes are also largely determined by local politics, which often parallels the general attitudes towards taxation within a given state. Often the highest taxes are in the Northeast and West Coast, whereas the lowest taxes are in the Southeast and the Central United States, Green said. New York, California, and Connecticut — states with traditionally high income and real estate taxes — also have among the highest gas tax rates.\n\nLike the federal gas tax, state gas taxes rarely change — and when they do, the changes are relatively modest. In the 15 years ending in 2014, 21 states made no changes whatsoever to their tax rates. Over the same period, only five states increased the rate by more than 5 cents per gallon.\n\nGas taxes, and the overall price of gas, can impact driving behavior. In six of the 10 states with the costliest gas, vehicle miles traveled per capita are also among the 10 lowest in the country.\n\nWhile driving behavior varies with transportation costs across states, Americans as a whole are driving more. Since the 1970s, the amount of miles the average American traveled has increased from an estimated 5,556 a year to 9,659 miles last year — the highest vehicle miles traveled per capita in history.\n\nTo identify the states with the highest and lowest gas taxes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state and average local gas taxes from the American Petroleum Institute (API). Average gas prices as of January 29, 2016 for each state came from AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The number of operating oil refineries in each state came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). We also reviewed average annual vehicle miles travelled in each state from the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). The number of licensed drivers in each state also came from the FHA. All data are as of the most recent period available.\n\nSTATES WITH THE LOWEST GAS TAX\n\n1.

LONDON — A ban on environmentally damaging microbeads found in toothpastes, face scrubs and shower gels came into effect Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe moves prevents manufacturers of cosmetics and personal-care items from adding the small pieces of plastic to their products. They often end up in the ocean after being washed down the drain, damaging marine plant and animal life.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama signed a U.S. ban on microbeads into law in late 2015.\n\nMicrobeads are also a potential hazard to human health: Scientists believe some fish in lakes may soak up the toxins they release, which can then be passed back to people who consume the fish. These toxins can disrupt hormone levels and cause cancer.\n\nThe world's seas and oceans are some of our most valuable natural assets and I am determined we act now to tackle the plastic that devastates our precious marine life, the U.K.'s Environment Minister Therese Coffey said in a statement.\n\nMicrobeads are entirely unnecessary when there are so many natural alternatives available, and I am delighted that from today cosmetics manufacturers will no longer be able to add this harmful plastic to their rinse-off products, she added.\n\nMore:'Beautiful' and 'horrible': Microplastics are polluting Lake Winnebago's fish\n\nMicrobeads an irritation in N.Y., Jersey waters\n\nLast week, British parliamentarians called on the government to introduce a special tax — the so-called latte levy — on disposable coffee cups. Britons throw away about 2.5 billion of them each year, according to a study by Cardiff University.\n\nAnd two years ago, Britain introduced a law requiring all large stores to charge 5 pence, about 7 U.S. cents, for all single-use plastic bags.\n\nThe United Nations has called for specific international goals to reduce plastic waste in oceans. It has faced opposition from the U.S. and China.
Imagine seeing a tax form pop up in the mail which indicates that you need to claim an extra $5,000 or more in taxable income on your federal income tax return. And you never, ever saw a dime of that money?\n\nBut now, are you supposed to pay taxes on it? Whoa, what's that about?\n\nWe're looking at a shocking tax time headache for potentially millions of victims of ID theft nationwide. They really don't owe extra taxes but they will spend extra time trying to clear up a mess triggered by widespread phony unemployment claims in 2020 in order to file their federal 1040 tax return.\n\nRobert Pennock was surprised to see a 1099-G show up that reports $5,772 in taxable income. That's money, allegedly, that he received in state unemployment benefits through the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency in 2020.\n\nIf he received unemployment benefits, it would be taxable income. But he was not laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic. He did not face any furlough. He never applied and never received state unemployment benefits.\n\nPennock works as a reading specialist for Hulsing Elementary School in Canton, Michigan. He teaches students from kindergarten through the fifth grade.\n\nHe did get a couple of clues in the summer that something was up. The human resources office for the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools spotted that unemployment claims were being made in his name in June.\n\nHe confirmed with HR that he did not file for unemployment. He's thankful that his employer is trying to help him work out the mess.\n\nHe said he immediately went to the Michigan unemployment insurance website and filed both fraud and identity theft claims.\n\nIt appeared to him, he said, that those jobless claims were not paid out since he received letters in the mail that his unemployment claim was denied for various reasons.\n\nAnd I figured that would be the end of that, said Pennock, 55, who lives in Plymouth Township, Michigan.\n\nIt wasn't. He received the 1099 form in the mail around Jan. 22.\n\nWhy am I getting a 1099 form for jobless benefits?\n\nThe State of Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity is including a letter with the1099-G forms that it is mailing out now to address identity theft.\n\nIf you have received a Form 1099-G and you have not filed for or collected unemployment benefits in 2020, you may be a victim of identity theft, the letter states.\n\nThe letter then details some steps to take, including reporting the fraud by filing a Form UIA 6349, Statement of Identity Theft. Michigan taxpayers would go to michigan.gov/uia and click on Report Identity Theft.\n\nPennock, whose wife Pamela typically prepares their tax returns by using tax software, is researching what he needs to do next. He's also contacted the office of his state rep in Lansing, 20th District State Rep. Matt Koleszar.\n\nPennock's mother just passed away at age 89 last week, the same week he got the troubling 1099. He had only been able to visit her once in the past year in Ohio during the pandemic.\n\nMy mother used to say it will all work out in the wash, he told me Tuesday. And I'm sure it will.\n\nOn Thursday morning, he had more hope that his mother's words could come true.\n\nGood news, Pennock emailed me. Thanks to Rep Kolezcar, someone from the UIA just called me. They are sending a corrected 1099 and directed me to Form 6349, available on the UIA website, which I am to complete and return. The form is titled 'Statement of Identity Theft.'\n\nHe's not angry with the state Unemployment Insurance Agency, as he knows how swamped people who work there must be.\n\nMy anger lies with the people who are taking advantage and stealing money from people.\n\nMassive jobless fraud sweeps the country\n\nAll across the country, including Michigan, professional crime rings used stolen ID information to file fraudulent unemployment claims in 2020.\n\nThe problem is that if your information was used to file phony jobless claims, the state could soon issue you a Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, issued in your name. Unemployment benefits are to be included in taxable income that goes on Schedule 1, Line 7 of a 1040 return.\n\nExperts say you can't just ignore this 1099, as this is income that has already been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. The incorrect 1099 might create extra headaches and delays when it comes to getting any tax refund.\n\nIdeally, you want the state Unemployment Insurance Agency to issue you a corrected 1099-G to both you and the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS notes in its own publications that you want to contact whoever issued the 1099 if it is not correct.\n\nIf you still haven't received the corrected 1099 form by the end of February, the IRS said, you may call the IRS at 800-829-1040 for assistance.\n\nBut, realistically, how long might that take? Will you receive a corrected form or an answer from the IRS in time to meet the April 15 tax filing deadline? How long would you have to wait for any tax refund that you're owed?\n\nRemember, the IRS will not even begin processing tax returns until Feb. 12. That's slightly more than two weeks later than last year.\n\nLynda Robinson, a spokesperson for Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency, said the state is currently not able to determine the number of people who are victims of ID theft.\n\nYet she noted that since March 15, 2020, the UIA has received more than 230,000 reports related to identity theft. Each case must be reviewed individually, she said.\n\nShe did not have a timetable for how long it might take for the state to issue a corrected 1099 so that people can file their taxes.\n\nUIA is working as quickly as it can to manually investigate each fraud referral, Robinson said.\n\nThere will be delays in getting a corrected 1099-G Form, she added.\n\nIf taxpayers receive a 1099-G because of a fraudulent claim and have not yet received a corrected 1099-G, she said the guidance from the IRS indicates that the taxpayer should not report the income from that 1099-G on a tax return.\n\nInstead, she said, the taxpayer should attach an explanation to the tax return explaining the discrepancy.\n\nThe IRS website has a guide on identity theft. See IRS.gov/identitytheft.\n\nLocal retiree questions what to do with 1099\n\nNow I have a 1099 that says it's for $4,880, said Karol Settergren, a retired high school counselor.\n\nTaking a close look at the 1099, she said, it shows that withholdings of $488 for federal income taxes and $270.40 for the state.\n\nIt has my Social Security number on here, she said.\n\nNow, I'm just concerned what happens when I go to file my taxes.\n\nSettergren, 73, did not file for unemployment benefits in 2020.\n\nShe remembers that she did get some paperwork in the summer that said she was denied her claim for unemployment benefits because she didn't provide enough identification. She did not keep that letter.\n\nAgain, though, she did not expect a problem since she received information saying the claim was reportedly denied.\n\nIt's just another thing to deal with, she said. It seems like everything is going wrong in this year of COVID-19.\n\nLast year, a large-scale imposter scheme hit state unemployment systems across the country. Many times, the crooks filed claims for people who didn't lose jobs, such as school teachers, retirees and even some small business owners.\n\nOn Monday, California officials confirmed that the state paid out more than $11 billion in unemployment claims relating to fraud during the pandemic, according to The Hill.\n\nAn independent report in November indicated that Michigan might have at one point through late May paid out up to $1.5 billion to such fraud.\n\nCon artists found phony jobless claims attractive and a way to steal generous jobless benefits of up to $1,000 a week offered in many states early during the pandemic.\n\nIn March, Congress passed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, which included a $600 supplemental federal unemployment benefit and offered benefits to workers who normally wouldn't qualify for state benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.\n\nThe crooks were very successful. It was estimated that at least $36 billion could have been scammed out of the system nationwide, according to the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Labor.\n\nTax professionals scramble\n\nGeorge W. Smith, a CPA with Andrews Hooper Pavlik in Southfield, Michigan, said he's looking at a 1099 for one client that reports $5,290 in state jobless benefits from the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency. Again, money that the taxpayer never received because no jobless claim was made.\n\nSmith's strategy is a bit of a judgment call – and one that isn't suggested by everyone. But he's going to try something different if a corrected 1099 doesn't arrive in time to file a return by April 15.\n\nSince there is a 1099-G out there, he said, he might report the income if a corrected 1099 doesn't show up.\n\nThe IRS computers will not be able to differentiate between what is legitimate and what is not, Smith said.\n\nHe would declare the 1099-G income on Schedule 1, line 7, Unemployment Compensation, on the 1040 federal tax return. But Smith said he will take a second step to make sure that his client isn't paying taxes on money that was never received in the first place.\n\nThen I am going to report it as negative income on Schedule 1, line 8 – Other Income, Smith said.\n\nThat way it nets out to zero taxable income on their return, Smith said. I am hopeful this will work. He also plans to attach a disclosure to the return explaining the situation.\n\nSmith said he wants his client to make sure that all documentation is in place to report the fraud and back up the claim that these fraudulent benefits aren't taxable, should the IRS challenge his reporting approach.\n\nEven so, your first step when you receive one of these letters has to be to contact the issuer of the 1099-G, usually the state unemployment office, and inform them of the fraud and ask for a corrected 1099-G, according to Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nLuscombe said you do not want to include the amount on the 1099-G on your tax return if it was fraudulent.\n\nHopefully, you can get the state unemployment agency to correct the 1099-G and file a corrected version with the IRS, but if not, attach a statement to your tax return that the 1099-G was a response to a fraudulent application that you are trying to get corrected and you did not apply for and did not receive any unemployment benefits, Luscombe said.\n\nYes, expect more headaches, too.\n\nState unemployment offices have been overwhelmed with valid requests for unemployment benefits as well as fraudulent ones, so their response may take a while, Luscombe said.\n\nHe would not be surprised if it could take several months for some to resolve these issues.\n\nThe State of Michigan warns of potential delays in its letter: Please be patient. The rampant imposter fraud and identity theft across the country requires that UIA individually review each claim of suspected fraud. If you have already provided information to the UIA, there is no need to resubmit information unless asked by UIA.\n\nThe Michigan UIA will investigate a report of identity theft. Once identity theft is confirmed, UIA will issue a corrected 1099-G to both you and the Internal Revenue Service, according to the state's letter.\n\nStates across the country are issuing these 1099s to fraud victims and alerting the victims on what to do next.\n\nThe State of Washington, for example, notes on its website: When criminals fraudulently claim benefits in someone else's name, we must investigate and confirm fraud before we can update the IRS.\n\nColorado has a form online to report an invalid 1099 for its ID theft victims.\n\nLuscombe said ID theft victims can expect that they will be asked for some documentation, such as verifying that you are still employed with your employer.\n\nYou also want to document all the steps you have taken to correct the fraud and the names and dates involved when you reported the ID theft. You may want to contact your local police department to document the fraud.\n\nIf you have a valid claim for unemployment benefits in addition to the fraudulent claim having been filed, the fraud process could also hold up your valid claim for benefits, Luscombe said.\n\nYou'd want proof that you are a victim of ID theft and that the benefits should not be taxed because a scammer received the money, not you.\n\nMore:How scammers siphoned $36B in fraudulent unemployment payments from US\n\nMore:How scammers are using unemployment claims to cash in\n\nMore:Lost a job? How to pay taxes on unemployment benefits\n\nMore:Tax season 2021: How to get a bigger, quicker tax refund\n\nThe strange 1099 means you must try to limit future ID theft, too.\n\nID theft victims are encouraged to file a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which is monitoring unemployment benefits fraud on a nationwide basis. Go to IdentityTheft.gov. A special tab on the right corner directs you to claims about unemployment benefits identity theft.\n\nTake time to check your free credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com to see if there is evidence of other fraudulent activity, perhaps credit cards that are opened in your name by crooks.\n\nThe IRS notes that you can place a free one-year fraud alert on your credit reports by contacting any one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies online or through their toll-free numbers. The bureau you contact must tell the other two. Call Equifax at 800-525-6285. Experian: 888-397-3742. And TransUnion: 800-680-7289.\n\nExperts say you might request a fraud alert or credit freeze from the three credit reporting agencies. If you opt for a credit freeze, you would have to have the freeze lifted if you need to take out a loan or apply for credit yourself.\n\nWhatever you do, don't just toss this 1099-G in the trash. It's better to try to deal with this problem sooner, rather than later.
Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nYour credit report and credit score can open doors you may never have imagined they could.\n\nAs most people know, an excellent credit report and a high credit score will afford you ample choices when you're shopping for a home loan at an attractive interest rate. But they can do so much more, too. Your credit report could also help you nab the job of your dreams, or get auto or home insurance at a lower premium than the average American. A pristine credit report could also mean little or no deposit when opening an account with a utility company.\n\nHowever, the flip side of this is also true. If you don't take the time to manage your credit wisely, then doors of opportunity can be closed. Prospective employers could deny your application based on the impression that you're not a responsible individual, and lenders could deny you for home loans. Rental applications may be denied due to your poor credit history, or you may be required to put down an exceptionally high deposit with utility companies prior to commencing service.\n\nYou could be hurting your credit score without even knowing it\n\nI'd venture to guess that most Americans are somewhat familiar with the basic factors that can impact their credit scores. For instance, if you pay your bills on time, your credit score will probably climb. Conversely, if you're late with your payments or have collections on your credit report, then your score is going to take a hit.\n\nBut there are other shocking ways that your credit score can be harmed through seemingly benign activities. Here are seven ways you could be hurting your credit score without even realizing it.\n\n1. Closing unused accounts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to hurt your credit score without realizing it is to close credit accounts that you rarely use. You may be thinking that closing unused accounts could earn you brownie points with creditors by demonstrating that you're being responsible. However, closing unused credit accounts actually hurts your credit score in two ways.\n\nFirst, closing long-standing accounts may reduce the average length of time that your credit accounts have been open. The longer your average account has been open, the higher your credit score, generally speaking. If you wind up closing long-tenured, good-standing accounts because you're not using them much, you're wiping out the benefit of having that account open and in good standing for a long period of time.\n\nSecondly, closing an account means reducing your available aggregate credit amount. Reducing your available credit causes your credit utilization ratio to rise. Anything above 30% aggregate usage could lower your credit score.\n\n2. Not checking your credit report\n\nAccording to a Google Consumer Survey conducted by TransUnion in 2013, 33% of Americans admitted to never checking their credit reports or credit scores. Ignorance is unfortunately not bliss in this instance, because it's quite possible for errors to appear on your credit report from one or more of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). Not checking your credit report annually could allow these errors to remain on your report without your knowledge, dragging down your credit score in the process.\n\nHere's the good news: You can check your credit report from all three credit bureaus once annually for free. That's right, I did just say free. To check your credit report for free, head to AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\n3. Using more than 30% of your available credit (even if you pay your bill in full)\n\nEven if you're responsible and pay your bills on time each month, you could be negatively impacting your credit score if you're using too much of your available credit. Industry pundits suggest that you never use more than 30% of your available credit. Using more could be construed by creditors as irresponsible, and it may lower your credit score.\n\nEven if you pay your bills in full each month, it's still possible (and I can speak firsthand on this) to hurt your credit score by going over the 30% credit utilization threshold. The good news is that the dip in your credit score is probably temporary if you're paying your bill in full and on time each month, or at least getting your net balance owed below 30% of your aggregate available credit. However, the timing of when a credit report is run could certainly have some bearing on whether your credit score takes a hit or not.\n\n4. Ignoring traffic and parking citations\n\nChances are that if you receive a traffic citation or parking ticket near your home city, you're going to take care of it. That may not always be the case if you're vacationing 2,000 miles away and receive a parking ticket. If you ignore traffic or parking citations, they could be turned over to a collection agency, where they could pop up on your credit report and remain there for a period of between three and seven years.\n\nIgnorance to a citation won't excuse you, either. If the government agency mails your citation to an old address and you fail to pay, the fault remains with you. Make sure the U.S. Post Office has your most recent address on file and your driver's license is up to date.\n\n5. Unpaid utility bills\n\nUtility bills, such as an electric bill or water bill, can be something of a double-edged sword for consumers. On one hand, it's highly unlikely that utility companies will report timely payments to credit bureaus that'll determine your credit score.\n\nOn the flip side, if you're habitually late with your payment, or you have unpaid utility bills, then the utility may not hesitate to turn your account over to a collection agency. Having an account sent to a collection agency can show up on your credit report for years, and it can adversely impact your credit score.\n\n6. Unpaid federal income taxes\n\nBelieve it or not, tax disagreements between you and Uncle Sam could come back to haunt you in the credit column. If you have unpaid federal income taxes, the government, after enough time and effort to collect what's due, could place a lien on your property or wages to collect what you owe.\n\nFederal tax liens can show up on your credit report for a mind-numbing 15 years, meaning they could wind up wreaking havoc on your ability to open new credit accounts for more than a decade to come. Even paid federal tax liens remain on your credit report for a period of seven years from the file date.\n\n7. Fines from a library\n\nWhile this may be a bit of a stretch, and I'll admit it sounds almost comical, checking out books from the library and failing to return them on time could wind up negatively impacting your credit score. If you rack up late fees at the library and fail to pay those fees, it's possible – unlikely, but possible – that the library could turn your late fee over to a collection agency.\n\nFor example, in 1996, the Queens Library system in New York hired a professional collection agency to collect the daily late fines, as well as the missing materials that consumers didn't return. Having a library fine sent to collections could result in an almost laughably low fine, but it could have an impact on your credit report and/or credit score for years.\n\nSean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nJasper: Police are looking for a man who disguised himself as Batman while stealing musical instruments from churches. A burglary happened Dec. 11 at King's Way Church in Irondale, AL.com reports. The caped crook stole a keyboard and a guitar, according to Irondale Detective Sgt. Michael Mangina. The suspect came back to the same church Jan. 6 and stole two more guitars. Both times the impostor used a rock to enter the church, Mangina said. On Jan. 9, two churches in Jasper and one in unincorporated Walker County were also burglarized, Jasper police wrote on Facebook. Musical instruments and electronics were also stolen. Anyone with information can call Irondale police, Jasper police or the Walker County Sheriff's Office. We have to take this bad guy off the streets, Mangina said. Stealing from a church is not the way to get to heaven.\n\nAlaska\n\nSkwentna: Weeks after a man's remote cabin burned down, he was rescued by Alaska State Troopers who found him by a makeshift shelter with an SOS signal stamped in the snow. Tyson Steele, 30, was picked up Thursday in what appeared to be good health at his remote homestead 20 miles outside Skwentna, troopers said in a dispatch. A mid-December fire had killed his dog and left Steele with no means of communication, Steele told troopers. After his family members and friends hadn't heard from him for several weeks, they requested a welfare check. The trooper helicopter crew reached the homestead about 11 a.m. and saw Steele waving his arms near the makeshift shelter. Skwentna, with a population of 35, is 70 miles northwest of Anchorage. The trooper helicopter transported Steele to Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The force was strong enough at a local store to reunite Luke Skywalker with his long-lost vinyl record. Actor Mark Hamill is praising workers at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange for returning the Star Wars: A New Hope soundtrack that had been a gift from film composer John Williams. Hamill tweeted that it felt totally unexpected & positively surreal to get back the record he hadn't seen since the early 1990s. He commended the store for being honest and not selling it. Williams had written on the vinyl's sleeve: Dear Mark Hamill, May the force always be with us. The record was one of numerous Star Wars items brought in by a woman after her father's death in 2018. Micheil Salmons, the store's general manager, said Hamill signed a DVD of Star Wars: A New Hope and two medals that are replicas of those given to his character and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, in the film.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican governor on Monday defended his decision to continue accepting new refugees, challenging skeptical GOP lawmakers to avoid creating fear about welcoming people from other countries. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told a legislative committee that fewer than 50 refugees will likely be resettled in Washington County in northwestern Arkansas under his decision. Arkansas is among 42 states that have said they will continue to accept refugees since the Trump administration issued an order in September that gave state and local governments the authority to refuse to accept them for the first time in history. Each of you are leaders in your community. You've got a choice to make: You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear, Hutchinson told lawmakers. He introduced them to two refugees from Congo and another from Afghanistan who have resettled to Arkansas in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding a California butterfly to the list of threatened species, officials say. The agency wants the Hermes copper butterfly added to the list in recognition of the threats it faces in its home region of San Diego County, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico's Baja California and California's San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state Department of Public Safety announced Monday that it will scale back proactive investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have perplexed residents since late last year. The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation's most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a tongue-in-cheek way to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold's birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold's legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold's body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The First State's roads are still some of the nation's most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state's number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation's leaders. There's no silver bullet to solve this, says John McNeal, chairman of the state's Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven't been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unsafe and filthy conditions at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority parking garages have prompted changes in how the structures are cleaned. Feces, bottles of urine, used condoms, overflowing trash and other unsanitary conditions were found at several Metrorail station garages, the transit authority's Office of the Inspector General said in a summary of its report. The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren't doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general's findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for teacher raises, the eradication of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, and a new law to force girls to get their parents' permission before getting an abortion. DeSantis said keeping taxes low, improving education and protecting the environment will help Florida continue to grow. The speech marked the opening of the Legislature's annual 60-day session. He spoke in the House chamber, where lawmakers desks' were covered in flowers. Members of the Supreme Court and the state's three Cabinet members also attended the address. While touting a boost in adoption, DeSantis told lawmakers he wants them to pass a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 get their parents' permission to get an abortion. The state already requires girls' parents be notified if they have an abortion.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state's coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden. A popular Honolulu bar and restaurant will close and be replaced by a new outlet of one of the nation's biggest restaurant chains, officials say. The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state's largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to steal our Mai Tai intellectual property. Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location. The Italian-American restaurant chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., is coming to Hawaii after years of television commercials running in the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nGrangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. I'll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it, Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is updating its birth certificate system to affirm the gender identities of transgender parents, after a transmasculine person asked to be officially recognized as a father who gave birth to their daughter. Myles and Precious Brady-Davis of Chicago learned after their daughter, Zayn, arrived in December that the Illinois Department of Public Health automatically names the parent who gives birth as Mother/Co-Parent on a birth certificate. Myles Brady-Davis is transmasculine, which describes a person who was born female but is typically masculine in gender expression. Transmasculine people do not always identify as male. Myles, who uses they/them pronouns, carried and gave birth to Zayn and wants to be listed as her father, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Precious Brady-Davis is a transgender woman and the baby's mother.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb has declared Jan. 27 Eva Education Day in honor of the late Eva Kor, the Holocaust survivor who dedicated much of her life to educating the world about the experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Jan. 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, were subjected to Mengele's experiments. The Terre Haute woman's experience was chronicled in a documentary titled Eva: A-7063. That film is part of an Eva Educational Toolkit that has been distributed to every middle school and high school in Indiana. Kor died July 4, 2019, while conducting her annual group tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.\n\nIowa\n\nHarlan: A man has asked a judge to let him engage in a sword fight with his ex-wife and her attorney so he can rend their souls from their bodies. David Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, said in a Jan. 3 court filing that his former wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, and her attorney, Matthew Hudson, had destroyed (him) legally. The Ostroms have been embroiled in disputes over custody and visitation issues and property tax payments. The judge had the power to let the parties resolve our disputes on the field of battle, legally, David Ostrom said, adding in his filing that trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States. He also asked the judge for 12 weeks' time so he could secure Japanese samurai swords. Shelby County District Court Judge Craig Dreismeier said in his own filing Monday that he won't be issuing a decision anytime soon, citing irregularities with both sides' motions and responses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake. Kimberly Alford says that until Jan. 6, her daughter had been a freshman at Whitefield Academy. That's when Alford says she received an email from the academy's head of school, Bruce Jacobson, explaining how her daughter was being expelled immediately due to a post on social media. Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy's beliefs and follows two years of lifestyle violations. Alford says her daughter is not gay, and the cake was simply a fun treat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The zoo in the capital city is asking for the public's help to name its newest male giraffe. The Baton Rouge Zoo is holding a contest for people to nominate their favorite names for the facility's latest addition, born last month. Nominations will be accepted through Jan.22. Zoo staff will take those public submissions and narrow them to three finalists, which will be up for a final vote from the public after that. The zoo will announce the finalists and more details about the voting at a later date. Six-year-old giraffe Rosie gave birth Dec. 26 to the male giraffe, the 20th giraffe to be born at the Baton Rouge Zoo.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal in the Legislature would halt a form of discrimination against people who take medication to prevent HIV infection. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland said the state's insurance code should be amended to prevent denial of life insurance for people who take pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV. The prophylaxis is commonly called PrEP. The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state's insurance code should reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state's largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime, Hogan said at a news conference. Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore. The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore's most violent year ever on a per capita basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group working to make it legal in the state for doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses says it will continue its fight despite a recent legal setback. Compassion & Choices in its suit filed in 2016 said legalizing the practice, referred to as medical aid in dying or MAID, would help terminally ill patients avoid needless suffering. In a decision Dec. 31, a judge said the issue should be left up to lawmakers. Compassion & Choices said in a statement Monday that it intends to appeal. This setback is disheartening, but we will continue this legal battle, Dr. Roger Kligler, a Cape Cod physician with terminal cancer and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in the statement. Second Thoughts Massachusetts, a group that opposes medical aid in dying, praised the decision.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state's breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about performance-related issues with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor's duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn't have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities. The department, which also runs the city's animal control unit, estimates about 300 turkeys are currently roosting and walking in residential neighborhoods. Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department's meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Tate Reeves was inaugurated as governor Tuesday, pledging to provide economic opportunities for all people in the state and to defend a loving culture that underpins our quality of life. Reeves, 45, is the 65th governor of Mississippi. He succeeds Republican Phil Bryant, who served two terms. This will be an administration for all Mississippi, Reeves said during his inaugural speech. Reeves served two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms before that as the elected state treasurer. He took the oath as governor before family, friends, lawmakers and other officials in the House chamber of the state Capitol. A culture of love and kinship has knitted Mississippi families together, and tied them to each other, for ages, Reeves said. It is what makes us special in a fast-paced and transient world. I will defend that culture against the erosion that frays societies.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Planned Parenthood is challenging the state's denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood's affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri's cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. It's kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance, said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood's attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with loopholes that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A campaign to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana use has submitted two proposed ballot initiatives for state review, the group New Approach Montana announced. The first ballot proposal would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults in Montana and establish a regulatory framework and a 20% sales tax. Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has prepared special Valentine's Day offers for people who want to mark the day at a state park. Guests who reserve a cabin or lodge room – at a 30% discount – at Eugene T. Mahoney State Park between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 can add a Valentine's Special package to their reservation.

Add the Silver Package for $25 and get complimentary champagne, wine or cider; sausage and cheese platter; bouquet of flowers; cheesecake dessert; drink tickets and more.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn't certain if the bird's death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause actual and substantial damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the and substantial language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The National Science Foundation has awarded two universities in the state and the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute a $5 million grant to establish a comprehensive forestry research center for the Southwest. The five-year grant will fund the development of a Center of Excellence in Forest Restoration. It will be charged with advancing the understanding of the effects of restoration activities on forested areas through a combination of multidisciplinary research and education. The center will train students in fire management as well as forest ecology and restoration, offering undergraduate and masters programs at Highlands University. Plans also include developing a collaborative Ph.D. program between Highlands and New Mexico State University.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city's policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state's attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department's fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James' office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state's coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting more like it's June, not January, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands' forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It's a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Self-driving shuttles will do a circuit through a residential neighborhood in the capital city as part of a yearlong pilot program starting in late January. Three 12-passenger, disabled-accessible electric shuttles will travel the 2.8-mile route in the Linden neighborhood. The shuttles, which are autonomous but monitored by on-board operators, will run between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m and connect riders to locations with social services like St. Stephen's Community House, which has a food pantry and health and job resources. Other stops include a recreation center and a transit center. The circuit will be timed so riders can connect to Central Ohio Transit Authority buses. The route will be suspended for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon as a precaution because of students walking to school, says Mandy Bishop, the program manager for Smart Columbus, the city's mobility initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has adopted a new electronic tracking system that will allow sexual assault survivors to monitor the location and status of their rape kits. The purpose of the system is to empower survivors with information, help law enforcement with investigations, and foster transparency and public trust, The Oklahoman reports. Only survivors and entities that update the system can access the records. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation operates the system, which was authorized through legislation passed last year. A task force made recommendations in an effort to improve the state's response to sexual assaults. I'm hoping it will hold all of us accountable to make sure that we don't let victims fall through the cracks, says Andrea Fielding, division director of criminalistics for the OSBI.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has voted unanimously to draft an emergency declaration legally allowing car camping in certain areas. Many members of the public who spoke at the council meeting Monday supported the push for car camping but stressed more needed to be done to help the homeless population. Most demanded immediate action. Mayor Chuck Bennett said he was deeply concerned about the homeless crisis, but it has been 30 years in the making, and officials are working to fight that crisis in a matter of weeks. He said the actions made during Monday's session will help meet the needs of the community. A study researching the option found the city has neither the funds nor the resources to manage a city-sponsored program. A privately sponsored program – where site owners provide supervision, trash receptacles and access to bathrooms – was suggested as an alternative.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state's second lady, Giselle Fetterman, will help lead a campaign to raise awareness of this year's census and encourage residents to respond, state officials said Monday. Fetterman, whose husband is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, said she will tour the state, making stops in Philadelphia and in Centre, Erie, Allegheny, Lancaster and Luzerne counties over the next three months. Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state's main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker's compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn't fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Mayor Knox White says he's found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he's still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It's the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nElk Point: A school district will pay $65,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by a former honor student. Addison Ludwig says she was singled out by the former Elk Point-Jefferson High School principal after she was featured in the student newspaper in 2017 and described a hobby as Netflix n' Chill with my boyfriend. Ludwig says she didn't know it was a term some use to describe casual sexual encounters until the principal, Travis Aslesen, made her look it up on the internet. Aslesen revoked her senior privileges and honors study hall and removed her as editor of the newspaper. Ludwig in her lawsuit said male students who used the term had not been disciplined, including a boy who had used the term in a profile in the newspaper earlier in the year, the lawsuit said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Senate started the 2020 legislative session passing its first bill of the year: a controversial measure that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies. It also prohibits the state from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of the group's refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.\n\nTexas\n\nStephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University's Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow's eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. We have two Fitbits on every cow, Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah's total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state's largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county's total population grew by 10,000 people.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill has been proposed in the Legislature to decriminalize adult prostitution. The legislation is co-sponsored by four female legislators. Rep. Selene Colburn, a Burlington progressive, said she thinks decriminalizing sex work will improve safety and health of prostitutes, mynbc5.com reports. The underlying question is do we need to criminalize consensual sex between adults on any terms? she said. Sex trafficking, exploitation and solicitation of minors will remain a serious felony, she said. The bill is in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure's future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we're more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a sponsor of the House resolution, said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle Police Department's civilian watchdog has found that an officer's ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver's suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect's friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver's friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Rescue dogs could soon become the state's official state dog under a proposal approved Tuesday in the Senate. The resolution, sponsored by state Sens. Ryan Weld and Stephen Baldwin, says it seeks to bring attention to dogs living in the more than 500 animal shelters in West Virginia. Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn't mean that there's something wrong with the dog, said Weld, a Republican. That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates. West Virginia already has a bunch of official state flora and fauna. The black bear is the state animal, the sugar maple is the state tree, the cardinal is the state bird, and the rhododendron is the state flower.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans are introducing a package of bills that would impose tougher sanctions and sentences on criminals. The legislation would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person's extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from finishing probation early; and block violent criminals from participating in early release programs. The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Trump touts tax overhaul as boon for farmers\n\nUS President Donald Trump is hailing the Republican tax overhaul law during a pitch to rural America at a meeting of the American Farm Bureau Federation. (Jan. 8)
Tina Orem\n\nNerdWallet\n\nMost people know that breaking tax rules, even accidentally, can bring serious consequences like an audit. It may seem like a one-way street, but the IRS has to follow rules, too. Here's what three tax attorneys say you should know.\n\nTaxpayers do have rights\n\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which the IRS adopted in 2014, summarizes taxpayer rights scattered throughout the tax code, making it easier to understand what the IRS can and can't do. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights groups taxpayer rights into 10 basic tenets. Under them, taxpayers have the right to:\n\nBe informed. Quality service. Pay no more than the correct amount of tax. Challenge the IRS's position and be heard. Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum. Finality. Privacy. Confidentiality. Retain representation. A fair and just tax system.\n\nIt's often helpful to reference these rights when talking with the IRS, says Glen Frost, a tax attorney in Columbia, Md. When talking with the IRS, Frost says he often points out that it's the taxpayer's right to be heard, for example.\n\nYou can push back\n\nIRS disputes can be intimidating. Frost says he's seen even certified public accountants become submissive around IRS agents. But the Taxpayer Bill of Rights provides the grounds to challenge the agency's position.\n\nThe first principle here is, these aren't rights that are granted by the IRS, but they're simply recognized by the IRS, and they all come down from the law that's either made by Congress or made by the courts, says Fred Daily, a tax attorney in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nTax news and advice\n\nTaxpayers have the right to retain representation. Taxpayers also have the right to talk to an IRS supervisor — a move that might save hours of time and frustration, Frost adds.\n\nThere are limits\n\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights may help you navigate disputes, but it's not necessarily a tool for things like resolving problems with a specific employee, for example, says Alvin Brown, a tax attorney in New York City.\n\nThe [Taxpayer] Bill of Rights is incomplete, and it needs some more backbone. It needs more structure, more specificity, Brown says.\n\nOther options for taxpayers include filing a complaint with the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, an IRS watchdog, or turning to the courts, he says.\n\nMORE:\n\nTina Orem is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

AP\n\nNFL owners will try again to settle the issue of relocation to Los Angeles, this time knowing that Commissioner Roger Goodell has declared the stadiums inadequate in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego.\n\nTwo days of meetings in Houston start Tuesday, six weeks after owners delayed a vote because they wanted more information on possible moves involving the Raiders, Rams and Chargers. Any move would involve one or two teams.\n\nAll three cities have tried to make their cases with the NFL, and each team recently submitted a formal relocation bid.\n\nThe latest development was Goodell's report last week to all 32 teams that says the existing stadiums are inadequate and unsatisfactory, and that the proposals the Raiders, Rams and Chargers received to remain in their current cities lacked certainty. The report is required in the relocation process.\n\nRams owner Stan Kroenke is planning a $1.8 billion stadium in Inglewood, California, at the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack. The Raiders and Chargers have a joint project in mind for nearby Carson. Kroenke also is willing to share his proposed stadium with either the Chargers or Raiders.\n\nA move requires approval from at least 24 owners.\n\nIt's a long, tedious process, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch said at the December meetings in the Dallas area. There's a lot of questions and there are not answers to every question yet. And there will be more questions when we meet in mid-January for sure.\n\nThe St. Louis proposal calls for an open-air, $1.1 billion stadium along the Mississippi River north of the Gateway Arch to replace the Edward Jones Dome.\n\nThe plan includes $150 million from the city, $250 million from Kroenke, at least $200 million from the league, and $160 million in fan seat licenses. The rest of the money comes from the state, either through tax credits or bonds. Goodell has countered that NFL policy limits the league's contribution to $100 million.\n\nSan Diego has a $1.1 billion proposal to replace aging Qualcomm Stadium, but it will require a public vote that likely wouldn't happen before June. The Chargers walked away from negotiations with the city and have focused their efforts on the Carson project.\n\nHouston owner Bob McNair, a member of the relocation committee, canceled a meeting with San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer last month, and made disparaging public remarks about city leadership.\n\nOakland is still in debt from a renovation 20 years ago when the Raiders moved back from Los Angeles. City officials have said they won't seek help from taxpayers with a new stadium, and asked the NFL for more time to develop a project in a league-required response to the Raiders' relocation plan.\n\nNo NFL franchise has moved since the Houston Oilers went to Tennessee in 1997. The Raiders and Rams both left Los Angeles after the 1994 season.\n\nI think the league, the NFL, looks at the disruption to any home city that potentially could lose their team to another city, Tisch said. And they look at it very seriously. No one is doing this to encourage clubs moving from Oakland, San Diego or St. Louis to Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Schuyler Dixon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apschuyler
John W. Schoen\n\nCNBC\n\nIf the ongoing congressional budget standoff forces a government shutdown, homebuyers and sellers could be subject to more headaches than usual before their deals close.\n\nThat's because buyers looking for mortgage approval could hit paperwork roadblocks if the shutdown furloughs workers at the IRS or Social Security Administration. This is what happened in October 2013, the last time budget gridlock forced a 16-day shutdown that sent millions of government workers on furlough and gummed up the works of the U.S. housing market.\n\nHere's how another shutdown could make buying or selling a home even more stressful.\n\nDoesn't the bank decide whether I get a loan? Why does the government have to get involved?\n\nWhile lenders use government guidelines for mortgage approvals, the decision ultimately belongs to the lenders. That's not the problem.\n\nAs anyone who has applied for a mortgage learns the hard way, the application includes a big stack of paper documenting your financial status, including records like tax returns.\n\nIn most cases, lenders want to verify all that paperwork, especially after the housing crash a decade ago when lenders went light on documentation, an approach that ended badly.\n\nIf the government does shut down, that includes workers at the IRS who are usually asked to verify the tax returns aspiring homebuyers submit to their mortgage lenders. (If you hear there's a problem with IRS Form 4056-T, you may have hit that particular roadblock.)\n\nIf the government shuts down, does the IRS stop completely?\n\nSome IRS workers would be exempt from furlough, including those who provide essential services like making sure records are maintained and the computers keep recording tax payments.\n\nBut verifying information and processing mortgage paperwork isn't considered essential. So those employees would have to stop working.\n\nThere's no working from home either. When the government shuts down, employees are not only barred from the buildings they work in, they're kicked off the network they access at their job.\n\nWhat else can go wrong with my mortgage application?\n\nBorrowers who are applying for an FHA or VA mortgage could run into delay if workers from those departments are sent home, and there's no one available to process the loan.\n\nA loan could also be delayed if a lender tries to verify a Social Security number. That's often required if something in an application doesn't match the information associated with a Social Security number in a credit report or other database, even if it's just a typo. If the lender tries to verify the number with the Social Security Administration, and no one at the agency answers the phone, that borrower could be out of luck.\n\nThe FHA hasa FAQ to help lenders and borrowers figure out how to work around some of these roadblocks.\n\nWhat if I can't get approved in timefor my closing date?\n\nIt's possible the deal could fall through, but it's much more likely the contract will just be extended. The last time the government shut down, some 17 percent of closings were delayed, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors.\n\nA handful of transactions were scuttled, and a few sellers reported that they lost bids because of the shutdown. Some 3 percent said they got a weaker offer, likely because of the uncertainty buyers faced over the length of the furloughs.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Fredreka Schouten\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – Taxpayer funding for presidential campaigns would end under a measure moving through the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBy a 5-3 vote, the Committee on House Administration on Tuesday approved a bill to kill the program, which is funded by a $3 checkoff on federal tax returns. This fund is antiquated, said Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., the committee's chairman.\n\nIn 2008, then-senator Barack Obama opted against using public funds in his presidential campaign, becoming the first major party nominee to reject taxpayer money. No Republican or Democratic presidential nominee has used public funds since.\n\nThe fund has died of its own lack of use, Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., said during the brief debate on the bill Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers said $317 million remains unused in the public funding account. The measure approved by the committee would funnel that money to deficit reduction and pediatric cancer research.\n\nThe political landscape has changed dramatically since the public-funding system took effect in 1976. Most candidates now reject taxpayer money – and the spending limits that come with it – to remain competitive in races flooded with unlimited funds from super PACs and other outside groups.\n\nJust two presidential contenders used public money in the 2016 election: Democrat Martin O'Malley, who collected nearly $1.1 million and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, who received more than $590,000, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe system needs improvement, not repeal, said Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Brady, the top Democrat on the House Administration panel. He pointed to a proposal by Rep. David Price, D-N.C., that would boost the amount that taxpayers donate and would give candidates $6 for every $1 they raised from small donors.\n\nThe measure approved Tuesday faces other obstacles before clearing Congress. But lawmakers already have demonstrated they want to reduce taxpayers' role in funding campaign-related activities. In 2014, Congress ended public funding for the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
Kay Bell\n\nNerdWallet\n\nOne of the biggest decisions taxpayers face each year is how to file their returns. Last year, 86%, nearly 132 million, of returns were filed with tax software. But most of those computer-prepared and e-filed returns — almost 79 million — were completed by tax professionals.\n\nWhy hire a tax pro to do your taxes online when you can use similar software to do the job yourself? Here are four questions to help you decide.\n\n1. How much are you willing to spend?\n\nPaying a tax professional can add up, especially if your filing requires a lot of forms and time. A National Society of Accountants survey released in 2015 found the average fee to complete a Form 1040 with itemized deductions on Schedule A and a state tax return was $273. That's along the lines of IRS estimates, which found the cost of filing a 1040 was $270.\n\nYou can buy tax software, on the other hand, for less than $100. Discounts common during tax season can slash the retail price even more. And if your adjusted gross income falls below $64,000, you can use the IRS' Free File, which, as the name suggests, allows you to prepare and file your taxes at no cost.\n\nTax news and advice\n\n2. How much time do you have?\n\nThe dollar cost to do your taxes is worth consideration, but don't forget the value of your time.\n\nThe IRS estimates that you'll need 16 hours to complete a Form 1040. That's the individual return that, according to the IRS, 69% of us use. The hours to complete this longest of the three options take into account gathering records, tax planning and filling out and submitting the return.\n\nIf you use a tax preparer, you'll also have to commit some time to gathering tax statements and other material. But once you deliver the necessary documents, you'll have more time for other tasks.\n\n3. How complex (or not) is your tax life?\n\nIf you're a single filer who rents an apartment and your workplace 401(k) is your only investment, tax software should work fine. Even when things get a bit more complex — you get married, have a child and itemize deductions for the first time — most software will walk you through these tax situations.\n\nBut if you run your own business, either as your main job or on the side, buy a home or inherit property, it's probably a good time to get some personal tax advice and guidance.\n\nWhile comprehensive tax software can handle these more complex tax situations, it cannot talk with you about your plans that could affect your taxes. A tax professional, however, can outline what might happen if you want to donate rather than sell the stock your Uncle Henry left to you. A tax adviser can offer insight into tax law changes that might affect you and whether you should make certain moves now or wait.\n\n4. Are you ready, willing and able to deal with the IRS?\n\nBy signing your tax return, you are responsible for all the information on the forms. If you do your taxes yourself, that means you're the one the IRS will come to with any questions — possibly years after you've filed.\n\nA tax pro, however, can be your point person. By filling out a line on your 1040, you can direct the IRS to bring any questions about the filing to your tax preparer. If you want to go further, you can give certain kinds of tax preparers — enrolled agents, CPAs, attorneys — power of attorney to represent you before the IRS.\n\nMORE:\n\nThe Fastest Way to Get Your Refund\n\nFind the Best Tax Preparation Software\n\n7 Tips to Find the Best Tax Preparer Near You\n\nKay Bell is a contributing writer at NerdWallet.\n\nNerdWallet is a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the web.

lightning killed fewer americans last year than any year on record, marking a steady downward trend that experts attribute to more awareness, better lightning-proof construction and fewer people working in farms and fields.\n\nlightning killed 16 people in 2017, the fewest deaths since accurate records began in 1940, the national weather service said. this broke the previous record low of 23, set in 2013, weather service meteorologist john jensenius said.\n\nthe number of people killed by lightning in recent years a far cry from annual lightning deaths decades ago: in the 1940s, for instance, hundreds of people were killed each year by lightning. in 1943 alone, 432 people died.\n\nin 2001, the weather service launched a lightning safety campaign, which included the now well-known phrase when thunder roars, go indoors. at that time, the nation recorded about 55 lightning deaths a year.\n\nover the past decade, an average of 27 americans were killed each year from lightning strikes, jensenius said. while we don't like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging, jensenius added.\n\njensenius said increased awareness prompted better lightning safety policy for outdoor sports and recreational organizations.\n\nand when lightning does strike, jensenius said, better medical treatment and access to automatic external defibrillators has helped save the lives of lightning strike victims. roughly 90% of people struck by lightning survive.\n\nthe highest number of lightning deaths occurred in florida, which recorded five fatalities. alabama followed with three and colorado, texas and north carolina had two each. the other two lightning deaths occurred in ohio and puerto rico. all but one of the victims were male. on average, 79% of lightning victims are male, based on data from 2006 to 2016.\n\nthe sharp drop in lightning deaths over the past 75 years  coincides with a shift in population from rural to urban regions, wrote meteorologist ronald holle in an article in the journal of applied meteorology.\n\nin the 1940s, there were many, many more small farmers who were out working in fields, which meant many more chances to be struck by lightning, jensenius said.\n\nin addition to better lightning safety awareness and medical advances, all phones were corded decades ago, leading to quite a few deaths due to people speaking on the phone. additionally, there has been better lightning protection, suppression and grounding in electrical and phone lines, he said.
secretary of state mike pompeo laid the blame for the escalating hostilities between the u.s. and iran on former president barack obama, accusing the previous administration of trying to appease the theocratic regime and arguing that the deal aimed at delaying iran's development of nuclear weapons only succeeded in funding regional terrorism.\n\nwe're trying to correct for what was the obama administration's appeasement of iran, pompeo said sunday on the abc news' this week.\n\nthis is a regime that has been acting against america for an awfully long time. and we are suffering from eight years of neglect and we're trying to push it back. we're trying to contain them, he said.\n\niran has vowed to retaliate for a u.s. airstrike that killed gen. qasem soleimani, the well-known leader of iran's elite quds force, near the baghdad airport last week.\n\n'i want to have peace':how trump went from a vow to avoid conflict to an order to kill iran general\n\nthe attack that killed soleimani came after iran-backed militias stormed the u.s. embassy in response to an earlier u.s. airstrike that killed at least two dozen militia fighters in sites in iraq and syria. the u.s. said that strike was in retaliation for a rocket attack in iraq that killed an american contractor and left four u.s. service members wounded.\n\nspeaking on cnn's state of the union, pompeo said the administration is prepared for anything the islamic republic of iran may do in response to soleimani's death.\n\nhe referred to the developing conflict as a war, which he said began when obama and the european union adopted the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa). under that deal, iran agreed to scrap its nuclear weapons program for at least 10 years in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of previously frozen funds.\n\nfrankly, this war kicked off – people talk about the war – this war kicked off when the jcpoa was entered into, he said.\n\npompeo said that under the terrible nuclear deal, which president donald trump pulled the u.s. out of, hundred of thousands of people died in syria and shiite militias grew more powerful.\n\nthese are things that were ongoing activities, resourced and funded by the trade and the money that was provided under the jcpoa, he said on this week.\n\nthat was the deal we inherited. it's a place we found ourselves, and we're working diligently to execute our strategy to convince the iranian regime to act like a normal nation, he said.\n\ncritics of trump's iran policy dispute pompeo's take on who is to blame for the current state of affairs, arguing trump set the u.s. on the path to conflict with iran by pulling out of the nuclear agreement.\n\nformer obama adviser ben rhodes said iran had been complying with the nuclear deal and that iran did not launch any rocket attacks on u.s. interests after the deal took effect.\n\ntrump pulled out and iran resumed nuke program and rocket attacks, rhodes tweeted.\n\npompeo said the u.s. strategy to contain iran included a diplomatic, economic and military components, as well as an enormous coalition of regional allies.\n\ndespite the secretary of state's belief that trump's iran strategy is absolutely working and that the world is a safer place with the killing of soleimani, critics said the actions further destabilized the region and risk an all-out war with iran.\n\ni really worry that the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the middle east. he promised we wouldn't have that. and i think we're closer to that now because of his actions, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., on this week.\n\nmore:iraq votes to expel u.s. troops after iran gen. qasem soleimani's killing\n\nschumer did not think soleimani's death made the world safer and he questioned whether trump was prepared for the iranian response.\n\nand let's face it, this president has made a mess of foreign policy. north korea, they're much stronger than they were when he started. in syria, he messed up. every encounter he has with putin, he loses, schumer said. and so, i am really worried, and that is why congress must assert itself.\n\ndemocrats in the house and senate have introduced a resolution barring the administration from taking military action against iran without further congressional authorization.\n\n‪let's not mince words: the assassination of qasem soleimani was an act of war undertaken without congressional authorization, in violation of the constitution of the united states of america, wrote reps. ilhan omar, d-minn., and barbara lee, d-calif., in a statement announcing the house resolution.\n\npompeo said the administration had all the authority we need to do what we've done to-date and promised it will continue to do things appropriately, lawfully, and constitutionally.\n\nbut sen. chris murphy, d-conn., who sits on the senate foreign relations committee, said sunday on cbs news' face the nation that trump does not have authorization from congress to go to war with iran and the killing of soleimani – which he called an assassination – potentially sets us on a course to do just that.\n\nmurphy said the trump administration's iran policy has been a disaster from the very beginning, arguing iran was more powerful now than when trump took office. he said obama and former president george w. bush also had the opportunity to kill soleimani but did not act on it despite the fact that he was carrying out attacks on u.s. forces, because they believed ultimately that would get more americans killed.\n\nthe democratic senator said the negative consequences of soleimani's death were already being felt as iraq's prime minister and parliament have called for u.s. troops to leave the country after nearly two decades.\n\nhe also accused trump of violating the war powers act by not consulting with congressional leaders before the strike. the administration has justified the attack on soleimani on the grounds that he was plotting future attacks on u.s. troops and interests. but murphy said the burden of proof is on the administration to show lawmakers that the iranian general represented an imminent threat.\n\nsen. mark warner, d-va., the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee, was one of the democratic lawmakers to be briefed after the attack.\n\ni accept the notion that there was a real threat, warner said on nbc's meet the press. the question of how imminent is something that i need more information on.\n\nhouse intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., agreed it was accurate to say soleimani was plotting against american interests.\n\nbut it's also true that soleimani has been plotting against the united states for decades. the question is, did the plotting here rise to the level that required his elimination from the battlefield? schiff said. i don't think the intelligence supports the conclusion that removing soleimani increases our security.\n\nschumer called the information he had seen from the administration very unsatisfying.\n\nsen. marco rubio, r-fla., who sits on both the foreign relations and intelligence committees, said trump's actions had been defensive.\n\nhe is not saying congress, i need 100,000 american troops to invade iran. that's why all this talk about war powers and congressional authority is so silly, rubio said. the president's not talking about invading iran. he's talking about responding to anything iran may do in the future. and the president has not only the full authority to do that, but an obligation to do that.\n\nrubio said trump was forced to act in the face of information that there is an imminent and credible threat that could cost the lives of potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of american servicemen and women and other personnel in the region.\n\nany president would have an obligation to act. and this president did, rubio said.
usa today\n\nthe partial government shutdown entered its 12th day on wednesday, as congressional leaders planned to meet with president donald trump.\n\n'hoping for the best, planning for the worst'\n\nby ernest johnson\n\neveryone affected by the shutdown is a real person, including myself. i have bills, just like everyone. and while i'm just a single guy, others are single parents, have families, are caring for elderly parents, among others. the shutdown has created 800,000 permutations of this example. just like many americans, i'm struggling to make ends meet.\n\nnot knowing how long the shutdown would last — and anticipating it might last more than two weeks, and that if we get back pay, it might not be for a couple weeks, as well — i chatted with ally auto finance and asked whether my account was in good enough standing to request a deferment due to the furlough and not having income. ally allowed it, but a deferment is a pay the interest in january and february is the difference of a full payment, so i'm still paying $160 this month, but next month it'll be about $360.\n\ntalker:is warren the candidate democrats have been waiting for?

washington – while the nation was watching how attorney general nominee william barr would answer questions on his record and views on policies, an 8-year-old boy in the audience seemed to steal the spotlight.\n\nbarr's grandson, liam, caught the attention of lawmakers, both republicans and democrats alike, who offered him snacks, a chance to sit with them and even a bit of career advice.\n\nbefore the hearing began tuesday morning, sen. john kennedy, r-la., sat down with the 8-year-old, who donned a green tie and dress shoes, in the chairs of lawmakers and chatted about making snowballs in snow-covered washington and flying on air force one.\n\ni had a great conversation with liam this morning, kennedy wrote on twitter. i'm looking forward to getting to know his grandfather, william barr, during the attorney general hearing today.\n\nas william barr walked into the hearing room to start hours of questioning, he stopped in front of liam and jokingly tried to take his nose. he started off his testimony in front of the senate judiciary committee by introducing his family. his three daughters are attorneys and both of liam's parents work as lawyers for the justice department.\n\nbarr, while listing the list of attorneys in his family, introduced liam as a future justice department employee to a crowded room of laughter.\n\nsen. lindsey graham, r-s.c. and chair of the committee, interrupted barr, telling the 8-year-old boy, think about medical school, liam. somebody needs to make money in the family.\n\nsen. dick durbin, d-ill., gave a little different career advice to liam, given how many of his relatives had worked in the justice department.\n\nhe ought to consider, at least for some balance, being a public defender, durbin said.\n\nlawmakers continued to poke fun at liam's future throughout the hearing and commended him for sitting patiently through hours of questions about barr's thoughts on special counsel robert mueller, russia, counter-intelligence investigations, torture, gun policies and president donald trump.\n\nhis feet dangling in the air, unable to reach the ground, liam sat in the front row of the audience and used a pen and notepad to get through the all-day affair.\n\nhe wrote a sweet letter to his grandpa, telling him, i love you so much. you are doing great so far. liam wrote that he was having so much fun.\n\nliam ended the letter to his grandpa with a misspelled last thought on how things had been going thus far: p.s. i think rusha's people are fine. it is the government is the problam.\n\nafter six hours on the hill, sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., paused before resuming questioning to say she was sending a care package from the dais that included a bag of chips, a snickers candy bar and a granola bar to barr's grandson for making it so far into the hearing.\n\nhe deserves a medal, feinstein said.\n\nthose online joked that liam had become the star of the hearing and more attention was being paid to the 8-year-old boy than to barr's policy decisions in the past.
mark mellman\n\nopinion contributor\n\nenforce the norms is not exactly a captivating bumper sticker, but it is a compelling rationale for removing president donald trump from office, immediately.\n\nwe are a nation of laws. we are also a nation of norms, and those norms undergird our democracy. without them, our laws and institutions would be insufficient to protect the republic our founders bequeathed us.\n\nsince 1950, there have been well over 200 successful coups worldwide, not because those countries had weak anti-coup laws, but rather because they suffered weak democratic norms.\n\nit is not against the law for a president to knowingly and repeatedly lie to the country, even though regular and extensive dishonesty from a president makes a mockery of democratic decision making.\n\nuntil president donald trump spent his term making 30,000 false and misleading statements, strong norms dictated honesty. recall the republican obsession with ambassador susan rice correctly quoting an incorrect early intelligence community assessment of the events at benghazi. as far as the gop was concerned unknowingly repeating an inaccurate statement supplied by executive branch agencies, was sufficiently egregious to render her unfit for membership in the president's cabinet.\n\nnorms are as important as laws\n\npresident trump rightly claimed that the law governing conflicts of interest specifically exempted him. the importance of the norm against presidents using their official positions to enrich themselves was articulated by no less than president trump's favorite supreme court justice, antonin scalia, who, as a justice department official, wrote that it would obviously be undesirable as a matter of policy for the president or vice president to engage in conduct proscribed by conflict of interest rules, whether or not they technically apply.\n\nno law, strong norm.\n\nwhile federal law does proscribe candidates from receiving anything of value from a foreign national, no law prohibits a president from asking foreign powers with whom the united states is in conflict to intervene on his behalf in u.s. elections.\n\nbefore president trump begged russia and china, as well as ukraine, for electoral help, the norms against such behavior were so strong that no candidate would have dreamed of making such requests.\n\nlawyers continue to debate whether the president ordering a state election official to find 11,780 votes, the number he needed to change the result in georgia, constitutes a crime, but the widespread condemnation of the conversation by republicans makes clear it violated a strong norm. no law prevents a president from employing hate speech, though until trump, presidents didn't.\n\nbut even strong norms erode if they are not enforced.\n\nsen. jon tester: members of congress who incited capitol riot must be held accountable\n\nduring impeachment, republican senators hid behind irrelevant legalisms. their argument that trump's behavior was not criminal altered, perhaps permanently, the founders' intent in defining high crimes and misdemeanors as grounds for removal from office.\n\nwhen the senate exonerated trump, they made it more likely that he and potentially, future presidents would ignore the norms that enable our democracy to function. and what was the result? more of the same, but worse. this time the president incited political violence, leading to homicide.\n\ntrump retains too much power to stay\n\nrepublicans claimed trump would be chastened by impeachment, even absent a conviction. they were wrong. instead trump was emboldened, and every senator who voted to acquit bears some responsibility for the trump's ensuing attack on democracy, culminating in last week's coup attempt.\n\nnow they're arguing it's too late to take action, and besides, this time, trump really has learned his lesson.\n\nit is not too late to enforce the norms. it is not too late to make a clear and unambiguous statement about the limits of presidential behavior. failure to do so could damage democracy for decades to come.\n\nbipartisan path: pence should threaten the 25th amendment and congress should impeach to purge trump stain\n\npresident trump abused his office for personal gain, sowed hatred, lied to america, attempted to subvert the electoral process, and finally incited insurrection and violence. he deserves to be punished for each of those violations of the moral order, even if they are not violations of criminal statutes. but more important, we the people deserve the protection afforded by the norms that ensure our democracy — protection we can only secure by removing trump, thereby enforcing those norms.\n\nif instead we just wait out the next week until joe biden is inaugurated, what will republicans say if trump uses his last minutes in office, acting within his legal limits, to pardon the very insurrectionists arrested for attacking the capitol, further eroding democratic norms?\n\nthen, it will be far too late.\n\nmark mellman, president of the mellman group and past president of the american association of political consultants, has helped elect 30 senators, 12 governors and dozens of house members, and was pollster to senate democratic leaders for more than 20 years. follow him on twitter: @markmellman
susan tompor\n\ndetroit free press\n\nwe're looking at a quirky new year for financial aid applications for college. parents and students face the prospect of filing two fafsas in 2016. yes, two times the bury-your-head-in-paperwork fun in one year.\n\nit's a one-time blip because of an upcoming change in the rules for the free application for federal student aid. the new rules kick off for the 2017-18 school year when filling out fafsa forms will start on oct. 1, 2016.\n\nfor students heading to college in the 2016-17 school year, though, the timetable remains the same as in past years when the fafsa filing season starts jan. 1. so it's time to get moving on the first fafsa round for the year.\n\nfiling the fafsa is one of those headaches that's a necessary part of college life. and let's face it, when you mix the federal government with academics, well, let the jargon fly.\n\nbut filing the fafsa is essential to receiving financial aid from the federal government, state government and most colleges and universities. it's a free form that covers one school year at a time.\n\nhow much aid you can receive, though, can vary considerably even within the same family each year.\n\nsmall changes in income, student assets and the number of children in college can have a big impact, said mark kantrowitz, a financial aid expert who is now publisher and vice president of strategy for cappex.com.\n\nhere are five things to know about fafsa:\n\nno. 1: file as early as possible once the forms are available.\n\nyou can file the forms online now for 2016-17. do not drag your feet and say, maybe, wait to file until you've actually completed your tax returns. do not wait for an acceptance email or letter from a given college, either. see fafsa.ed.gov.\n\nthe actual deadlines vary by state. if your legal residence is michigan, for example, the deadline for the 2016-17 school year is march 1. a chart at the fafsa site lists deadlines by state. iowa, for example, lists july 1 by midnight central time. earlier priority deadlines might exist in iowa for certain programs.\n\nkaren mccarthy, senior policy analyst for the national association of student financial aid administrators, said the biggest mistake that parents and students make is that they wait until the last minute possible fill out the fafsa form, instead of filing as soon as possible.\n\nthey do not file early enough because they think they have lots of time to do it, mccarthy said.\n\nbut some financial aid is awarded, for example, on a first-come, first-served basis. some schools have earlier deadlines.\n\none tip: many states offer college goal sunday programs in january, february and march. such sessions provide free help to complete the fafsa form.\n\nsee collegegoalsundayusa.org. or see micollegegoal.org for a list of events across michigan, most of which run in february. or you can call 800-832-2464 on weekdays for information on the michigan programs.\n\nanother good resource: u.s. department of education's toll free hotline is 800-433-3243.\n\nsome local high schools also hold financial aid nights or other events to help parents and students learn about fafsa.\n\nno. 2: don't over-inflate your investments.\n\nwhen it comes to fafsa forms, money in a retirement plan, including a 401(k) and ira, is not counted as part of your assets or investments, kantrowitz said. you also do not need to include the net equity in your primary home. you would count equity in a vacation home or rental property on the fafsa form.\n\nif you take a distribution from your 401(k) plan that year, of course, that money would be counted as income for the fafsa form.\n\nmillennials get an extra boost to save for cars and homes\n\nkantrowitz said one of the big mistakes people make involves listing money in retirement plans among assets, thereby inflating your wealth and possibly reducing the student's chances for financial aid.\n\nin general, it can help to gather your paperwork before trying to sit down and complete the form. you can file estimated figures in advance of actually filing your 2015 income tax return. so you'd need your final pay stub for 2015, w-2 forms and 1099s.\n\nif you use estimated tax information to fill out a fafsa, you must correct that information after you file your tax return. you can use the internal revenue service data retrieval tool, which is available within the online fafsa, to access irs tax return information needed to complete the fafsa and transfer the data directly to fafsa from the irs.\n\nyou'd need records of other taxable income, including unemployment benefits, too.\n\nif you've filed the 2015 tax return early or you wait to file the fafsa form until you do, you'd gather that 1040 tax form too.\n\nthe fafsa will require social security numbers. and for dependent students, the fafsa will also require the parent's social security number. a student's driver's license is optional -- and recommended -- to provide a way to verify the student's identity.\n\nno. 3: take time to read the instructions carefully.\n\nunfortunately, it can be easy to plug in an answer online when you really don't know the answer. but this isn't like some standardized testing. you don't get extra points for guessing.\n\ncatherine berrahou, director of financial aid and scholarships at walsh college in troy, said the online form for fafsa does give helpful hints and tips, if you don't understand a question.\n\nwhat's a common error? one question involves what you paid in federal taxes, she said, but sometimes a parent or student will fill in the adjusted gross income. that's not correct, as income tax is not the same as income, according to a warningon a u.s. department of education blog.\n\nor some could mistakenly leave blank the area to report a parent's income from work.\n\nberrahou recommends that students go back within a day or two after filing the form to make sure the application was not rejected. if it is rejected, she said, take extra care and provide the necessary information soon.\n\nanother common mistake? take care to fill out the exact name that's listed on the student's social security card. if you're daughter's birth name is jane and that's what's on social security records, don't fill out jenny if that's what she calls herself now. do not use nicknames.\n\ndid you just win a college scholarship? or not? marketing can be deceptive\n\nother tips: do not forget to sign the fafsa forms. if you're a dependent student, you also need to report information relating to your parents.\n\nno. 4: divorced? some families first must determine what parent to list on fafsa.\n\nfamily life can add a different twist to the fafsa mix.\n\nanita myles, senior vice president for edvisors.com, said it's essential to review the rules in cases when parents are divorced or when there are other special family situations.\n\nfor example, if the student's grandparent legally adopts the student, the grandparent will be required to complete the fafsa, according to the filing the fafsa book that's free online at www.edvisors.com.\n\nif the student only lives with the grandparent -- and was not adopted by the grandparent -- the grandparent is not considered to be the parent when filing the fafsa form. but at the same time, any financial aid provided by the grandparent to the student should be reported as untaxed income to the student on the fafsa, kantrowitz said.\n\nin the case of a divorce, the dependent student would need to review which parent he or she has spent the most time with in the past year. if time was split evenly, myles said, the parent for fafsa would be the one who provided the most financial support.\n\nno. 5: be prepared come october to have all this fun again.\n\na new start time for the fafsa season hits for the 2017-18 school year when filling out fafsa forms will start in october.\n\nthe strategy is twofold: high school seniors and others could apply for financial aid in the fall around the same time as they fill out applications for colleges. plus you'd have the 2015 tax return to use when filing the fafsa for the 2017-18 academic year.\n\nrick castellano, a spokesperson for sallie mae, said the october kick off could take some of the mystery out of getting appropriate tax information so early in the year. the earlier kick off could encourage some families to take time to file the fafsa.\n\nthe last thing you want to do is miss out on free money for college, castellano said. you don't want to leave that free money on the table.\n\ncontact susan tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com. follow susan on twitter @tompor.

the venue was packed with more than a thousand people waiting to see pete buttigieg, and a chant had broken out for the democratic presidential candidate a few minutes before he took the stage.\n\nkasey peters, inside the hall, did not chant along. he did not hold up a sign for the former south bend, indiana, mayor, like some around him, or outwardly applaud buttigieg's remarks. the 31-year-old compliance analyst was there just to listen.\n\nthe saturday event was only peters' second time seeing a candidate in person this iowa caucus cycle. he saw sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts nearly a year ago, when she first announced her bid for the democratic presidential nomination. peters had effectively tuned out the crowded race since then, and he's still undecided.\n\nthings will change in the weeks ahead, as peters goes to other candidate events and reads up on policy proposals.\n\nnow that we're getting closer to caucus, i'm diving in, he said.\n\nwith a month to go before the feb. 3 caucuses, iowans like peters appear to be everywhere. multi-candidate events draw large turnouts from fervent supporters, but there are also those in the first-in-the-nation caucus state who are not sure which candidate to support. they're only now beginning to venture out to see the candidates in person, despite the inundation of political ads on television and nearly 2,000 public events candidates have hosted in iowa in 2019.\n\ni am one of the undecided, declared jenny burton, a social worker who attended the west des moines buttigieg event. burton noted that she had met author marianne williamson in des moines a few days earlier. burton is actively considering multiple candidates, including williamson and warren.\n\ni'm trying to get in with anybody who's coming to the community, burton explained about her caucus strategy in the weeks ahead.\n\nburton added about the candidates: i respect all of them, almost equally. that's why it's so difficult for me to narrow it down to one.\n\n'undecideds' spark hope for low-polling candidates\n\nin september, a des moines register/cnn/mediacom iowa poll showed just one in five likely democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, while 63% said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\n\nan iowa poll released in november showed an uptick in decision-making: more respondents — then at 30% — said they had a first choice and their minds were made up. but 62% who said they had a first choice also said they could still be persuaded.\n\nthat indecision has been a lifeline for several presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the iowa caucuses, despite a shrinking debate stage that has limited some candidates' exposure.\n\ndave waters of boone saw sen. cory booker of new jersey speak in adel on dec. 20. the senator, who failed to make it onto the debate stage in los angeles the day before, was on waters' list of possible picks.\n\nwaters said he has usually decided which candidate to caucus for by now.\n\nthere's too many good ones, waters said about his dilemma this time.\n\nsome likely caucusgoers are in no rush to figure things out.\n\njim oxendale, who saw sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota at a dec. 22 event in ida grove, said he won't make a final decision until the last 15 minutes before the caucuses.\n\ni think this is a very serious thing, said the 70-year-old oxendale, who also lives in ida grove. and it makes me nervous to commit to somebody too early because we're a long way from february.\n\nafter hearing former vice president joe biden speak in tipton on saturday, west liberty resident faye petersen said she is beginning to think that perhaps he's the one.\n\neven so, petersen added, she is still undecided — she also likes klobuchar, booker and entrepreneur andrew yang — and she fully expects to change her mind at least a few more times before she attends her caucus.\n\ni will make it up before then, she said, dismissing any pressure to choose.\n\nevery darn one of them is way better than what we have, petersen said.\n\nstill a lot of candidates to choose from\n\npeters, who attended the buttigieg event in west des moines, said he tuned out for most of last year because there were so many candidates in the race. that number has dropped only a little, from a high of more than two dozen to 15 candidates.\n\npeters said while his interest in warren has subsided, he likes buttigieg. he is also intrigued by former rep. john delaney from maryland.\n\nhe's someone i'd like to look a little more into, peters said of delaney. … he's kind of been someone i've paid attention to the whole time he's been in the race.\n\npeters said he knows several friends who are undecided like him. he said some have expressed interest in sen. bernie sanders from vermont and yang.\n\neverybody is still exploring, he said.\n\nrachel foubert is also undecided, but that wasn't always the case.\n\nthe 25-year-old teacher had committed to caucus for kamala harris. now that thesenator from california is out of the race, foubert is actively looking for the next person to support. she attended a biden event in williamsburg on dec. 27, in part because it was close to her home in north english, about 30 miles away.\n\nbut foubert has found no favorites yet that resonate with her the way harris did. so she plans to see as many candidates in person as she can. the biden event was the first for her. she said she was drawn to biden's experience with foreign diplomacy.\n\ni just want

michael o'hanlon\n\nopinion columnist\n\nwhat should america's next president, democrat or republican, do about afghanistan? with an electorate tired of forever wars and a new pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with russia or china, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete u.s. departure is palpable.\n\ninstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the u.s. military mission in afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current u.s. deployment in iraq. that would allow the united states a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in afghanistan, as well as pakistan. the slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. that time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the afghan government and the taliban by the end of 2020.\n\nby the time america's next president is inaugurated on jan. 20, 2021, america's role in the afghanistan war will be approaching its 20th anniversary. afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the soviet invasion there in 1979.\n\nwe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\n\namericans are understandably tired of this war. it has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first obama term.\n\nhowever, the recent washington post story alleging that officials engaged in pentagon papers-like deception of the american public about the mission is badly misleading. whether it was the initial bush administration strategy on afghanistan, the mcchrystal review early in the obama years, or any of the subsequent obama/trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\n\nnonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. the afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. even more to the point for americans, the united states has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within afghan borders. the united states probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\n\nthe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. the good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\n\na future force of 5,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other nato military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 gis there. it would be 95% less than the 100,000 u.s. troops commanded there by gen. david petraeus and then gen. john allen at the peak of the american presence in 2010-11. this lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\n\nthe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. by laying out a plan designed to last for several years, washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter obama and trump years.\n\nthe number of u.s. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. the size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. but for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\n\npeace process:u.s. presidential hopefuls owe afghan women their support\n\nthis idea for a smaller but enduring u.s. military presence in afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the democratic base. but democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating president donald trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in syria.\n\nof course, trump administration policy could change dramatically before election day as well. absent a comprehensive peace deal with the taliban by next fall that also involves the afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor pakistan likely have in the idea — president trump will face a dilemma. he will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect america on the other.\n\nal-qaida remains present in afghanistan and just over the border in pakistan, where drones flying from bases in afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. the presence of the islamic state terrorist group in afghanistan has been growing, too. neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the united states.\n\neven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of america's and nato's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. thus, trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-qaida and isis.\n\nwe cannot fight without boots on the ground\n\nsome will say terrorism in and near afghanistan can be checked even without an american military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the taliban. perhaps any future al-qaida or isis presence on afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the indian ocean. or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in afghanistan.\n\nbut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\n\nwith 5,000 american troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in afghanistan, the united states could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at bagram near kabul in the nation's center, near kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either khost or jalalabad in the east. it also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in kabul, to help the afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\n\nit's time to leave afghanistan:take the deal, president trump; 18 years is enough\n\nthe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. it would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\n\ncommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to pakistan and the taliban that the new u.s. president would not be expecting a hail mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\n\nthe united states needs a policy that recognizes afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, u.s. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. that overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\n\nmichael o'hanlon, a member of usa today's board of contributors, is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and author of beyond nato: a new security architecture for eastern europe. follow him on twitter: @michaeleohanlon
washington, d.c. – boy scouts of america faces mounting legal liability as lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by leaders and volunteers continue to roll in, thanks in part to loosening statutes of limitations across the country.\n\ntoday, lawyers with abused in scouting filed suit in washington, d.c., on behalf of eight men who say they were abused as kids by scout leaders and volunteers. the district in may eliminated time restrictions for sexual abuse survivors to pursue civil litigation and opened a two-year window for survivors under the age of 40 to file suit regardless of the date of the incident.\n\nseparately, attorneys gilion dumas and ashley vaughn plan to file suit in california on behalf of 14 plaintiffs with similar claims. that mass action suit comes days after california's assembly bill 218 took effect, allowing victims of child sexual assault to file suit until age 40 and opening a three-year window for those abused as children to sue for past incidents.\n\nattorney paul mones, who along with dumas won a landmark $19.9 million verdict against the scouts in 2010, said he expects a flood of litigation in california.\n\nwith the advent of all this consciousness of abuse in boy scouts, and all the things that happened in the last few years, there's going to be a tidal wave of cases against them.\n\nmones filed suit on behalf of a 17-year-old client in december in san bernardino county superior court and estimates his firm has an additional 75 suits filed against boy scouts and as many as 200 more in the works.\n\nmore:nearly 800 accuse boy scouts of failing to protect them from sex abuse as new lawsuit is filed\n\nmore:boy scouts, catholic church, more face new lawsuits as ny child victims act window opens\n\nin a statement, boy scouts expressed outrage that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our program to abuse innocent children.\n\nthe boy scouts of america is committed to fulfilling our social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in scouting, the statement reads. the bsa has a multi-layered process of safeguards informed by experts, including the following, all of which act as barriers to abuse: a leadership policy that requires at least two youth-protection trained adults be present with youth at all times and bans one-on-one situations where adults would have any interactions alone with children – either in person, online or via text; a thorough screening process for adult leaders and staff, including criminal background checks and the prompt mandatory reporting of any allegation or suspicion of abuse.\n\ncalifornia and d.c. join a wave of states and territories that are extending time for survivors of child sexual abuse to press charges and seek civil damages. since 2009, lawmakers in 38 states have introduced such bills, according to a usa today analysis. twenty-nine states have enacted laws, including new york, where at least a dozen cases have been filed against the scouts since the new law took effect in august.\n\nthe push to extend statutes of limitations or eradicate them altogether came about in part through better understanding of how long it can take survivors grappling with trauma to come forward. the average age of disclosure is 52, according to child usa, a think tank that focuses on preventing child abuse and neglect. some people never disclose what happened to them.\n\ngrooming is very powerful. the predators who learn how to groom know how to isolate people and know how to do it very well, said dave henson, one of the eight john does in monday's suit in d.c.\n\nhenson, now 39, said he was abused by an assistant scout leader over a span of five years, starting when he was 11. the grooming was so meticulous, henson said, that he didn't realize the late-night touching that turned into penetration was abuse until years later, when he told his high school sweetheart.\n\ni wanted to be open and honest with her, and said, 'hey, i've had a homosexual relationship, and she kind of looked at me weird. i explained to her what kind of happened, she again looks at me and said, 'you didn't have a homosexual relationship; you were abused.'\n\neven after her revelation it didn't really sink in. i didn't really understand why i had all these emotions of shame and guilt, which led to drinking, a lot of drinking, henson said. that's why these windows and statutes of limitations are so important, because it takes so long sometimes to come to that realization.\n\nhenson's attorneys are hoping to set a new precedent for survivors who live in states that have not opened so-called look-back windows or changed their statutes. the group, which has been running tv and google ads encouraging victims to come forward, says it has signed more than 1,600 clients since last spring, many of whom live in states with restrictive statutes of limitations.\n\nall eight of the plaintiffs in monday's suit, including henson, live in states that have not yet opened windows.\n\nthe problem with boy scouts is this is a national organization, and it's really a national problem, said attorney aitan goelman of d.c.-based zuckerman spaeder, an abused in scouting member firm. to have such disparate treatment of survivors based on an arbitrary geographical factor is not fair. it's not just.\n\ngoelman says d.c. is a proper venue for the suit because a congressional charter incorporated scouts in the nation's capital in 1916. the charter also required an annual report to congress on the activities of the organization.\n\nthe suit, along with nearly all reviewed by usa today, alleges that boy scouts knew it had a rampant child sexual abuse problem as far back as the 1920s but concealed the issue to protect its wholesome image. in several cases, survivors accuse the scouts of failing to stop known abusers from returning to their ranks and abusing again.\n\ndumas said her firm has successfully brought cases in montana, iowa, idaho and oregon on claims that boy scouts committed fraud by concealing their knowledge of the threat of sexual abuse within the organization.\n\na suit filed in arkansas in november alleges abuse against two former scouts who say they were assaulted by a leader who had previously been reported to the boy scouts of america for abuse in georgia. according to the suit, the leader had been added to the ineligible volunteer files but was later allowed to become a leader in arkansas.\n\nboy scouts could have gotten ahead of this early on but literally chose not to, said mones, who says his client in san bernardino was abused up until 2018. i believe they've been trying to look at that problem, but the problem is that it's a day late and a dollar short.\n\nthe organization has begun to show the strain of mounting legal bills. last year, reports began to emerge of a potential bankruptcy filing. boy scouts has denied a filing is imminent but said it is exploring all available options.\n\nin october, the organization raised annual membership fees from $33 to $60, and last month it confirmed it had mortgaged the philmont scout ranch in new mexico, one of its most prized properties where troops from across the country go for days-long treks. it said similar liens are in place for other properties, according to the associated press, including its headquarters in irving, texas, and bases in florida, minnesota and west virginia.\n\non jan. 1, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints followed through on its plan to pull hundreds of thousands of mormon youth out of scouts in favor of its own program. that withdrawal means an 18% drop in already declining membership for scouts, predicted to dip below 2 million for the first time since world war ii.\n\ncara kelly is a reporter on the usa today investigations team, focusing primarily on pop culture, consumer news and sexual violence. contact her at carakelly@usatoday.com, @carareports or carakelly on whatsapp.\n\ncontributing: marisa kwiatkowski, usa today;

reddit has banned a popular subreddit used by supporters of president donald trump, as more tech companies crack down in the wake of riots at the u.s. capitol.\n\nin a statement, reddit confirmed the subreddit r/donaldtrump was banned for repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the u.s. capitol.\n\naccording to a cached version of the subreddit, the channel had more than 52,000 members.\n\nreddit's site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals, said the social media platform in a statement. in accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed.\n\nsocial media:president trump blocked from posting to facebook, instagram 'indefinitely'\n\nmichelle obama:former first lady calls for trump to be permanently banned from social media\n\ndetails of the ban were first reported by axios.\n\nin the aftermath of riots in d.c. during which a mob stormed the u.s. capitol, social media companies have taken a more aggressive approach to statements from trump. facebook said it is planning to block trump from the social network and instagram indefinitely.\n\nwe believe the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, said facebook ceo mark zuckerberg in a post thursday.\n\ntwitter temporarily blocked access to trump's account, requiring him to delete tweets related to events at the capitol. meanwhile, video game streaming site twitch disabled trump's account. techcrunch reports snapchat also disabled trump's account.\n\nfollow brett molina on twitter: @brettmolina23.
ap\n\nlake forest, ill. (ap) — the chicago bears might be ready to split with quarterback jay cutler.\n\ntop receiver alshon jeffery's future is in question. change could be coming to the coaching staff, too.\n\nthe bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the nfc north with a 3-13 record. they got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.\n\nnow, it's time to regroup.\n\nit was all bad, linebacker pernell mcphee said. i'm happy we're out of 2016.\n\nthe bears are 9-23 in two seasons under john fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.\n\nit didn't help that 19 players finished the season on injured reserve, including cutler and guard kyle long. jeffery and linebacker jerrell freeman also served four-game suspensions for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nit added up to the bears finishing with their highest loss total since 1969 and missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years.\n\ni want to go to the playoffs, long said. i want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. a frickin' playoff game in chicago — can you imagine that?\n\nit hasn't happened since the 2010 team lost to green bay in the nfc title game. the bears enter this offseason with the no. 3 pick in the draft and some big issues to address on their roster.\n\nwho's the qb?: the biggest question facing the bears? that's easy.\n\nthe bears' all-time leading passer, cutler has no guaranteed money left on the seven-year contract extension he signed in 2014. at 33, he was limited to five games because of a thumb injury and then a torn right labrum that led to him being placed on injured reserve.\n\nthen again, the bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. that's an issue they need to address, whether they keep cutler or bring in another veteran.\n\njeffery's future: though it's not clear if he will still be with them, jeffery guaranteed a super bowl championship for the bears next year. he even compared them to the new england patriots.\n\nwe're just like them, the only difference is just a few plays here and there, he said.\n\njeffery played for the $14.6 million franchise tag this season. the bears could tag him again if they don't agree to a multiyear deal, though that would be an expensive option to use on a receiver with a ped suspension and a history of injuries.\n\nit would be easier to part with jeffery if the bears knew what they had in kevin white, the no. 7 overall pick in 2015. but he was limited to four games because of a fractured left fibula after missing his rookie year with a stress fracture in his left shin.\n\ni'll be just fine, said white, who hasn't started running. just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back.\n\non staff: while fox said last week he wasn't planning to make changes to his staff, he didn't quite slam the door on it, either.\n\nmaybe he and general manager ryan pace will provide more clarity on the status of defensive coordinator vic fangio and offensive coordinator dowell loggains when they meet with the media on wednesday.\n\nthere was a report of friction between fangio and fox a few weeks ago. fangio might also get interviews for head coaching jobs.\n\nloggains came under scrutiny in his first season as chicago's offensive coordinator.\n\ngetting healthy: the bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.\n\ncutler, long, white, nose tackle eddie goldman and linebackers lamarr houston and danny trevathan all wound up on ir. other important players shuffled in and out of the lineup because of injuries.\n\ni think i'm just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year, said long, who is recovering from ankle surgery and will undergo a less invasive shoulder operation. i'm going to look like the christmas story kid. it'll be summer months, i'll be in like three north face (jackets). but, yeah, honestly, it's football. it's a tortured existence from a physical standpoint.\n\nbuilding blocks: there were some bright spots for the bears.\n\nlinebacker leonard floyd showed promise with seven sacks after being drafted no. 9 overall, though he did suffer two concussions late in the season.\n\njordan howard broke matt forte's franchise rookie rushing record with 1,313 yards. rookie cody whitehair looks as though he has a home at center.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/ap_nfl
the bright orange kenneth cole suitcase circled the baggage claim carousel at dallas love field with what looked like an antenna.\n\na piece of wire was all that remained of the retractable handle on the hardside bag.\n\ni pushed it into the southwest airlines baggage claim office to file a claim, short on time and unsure of what came next. it was the first time an airline damaged my bag. delayed bags, i knew the drill. lost bags, too, as an airline permanently lost a bag of mine several years ago.\n\nhere's what i learned: travelers have options when it comes to damaged bags, and knowing your rights will put you in a better position to resolve the claim.\n\nif you have a claim, that is. an airline's definition of damage, backed by the u.s. department of transportation, may differ significantly from a passenger's definition. normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.\n\nevery airline damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. and it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking a designer bag.\n\nif you have a louis vuitton (bag) and it goes through the (conveyor) belt system, it is not white glove service,'' said lisa ouimette, an analyst in american airlines' central baggage services office. these are belt loaders. if you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.''\n\nairlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zippers, as well as poor quality bags and bags that were damaged when checked in.\n\nso what is covered?\n\ndamage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. the latter is a big problem in cold weather, ouimette said. (so are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)\n\nwe anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,'' she said.\n\npassenger rights if an airline damages your bag\n\nmore than 87 percent of u.s. travelers don't file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by airhelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. the three main reasons: they didn't think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights and they did not know how to file a claim.\n\nairlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline's control, according to the u.s. department of transportation's aviation consumer protection division.\n\nthe cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. many use dallas-based rynn's luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.\n\nif a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a like bag or passengers will be reimbursed. the reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the dot says, subject to liability limits.\n\nfor flights within the united states, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is $3,500. the limit on international flights, per the montreal convention, is about $1,600, the agency says.\n\nairlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the dot.\n\nthat doesn't mean you're going to get $3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (the higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)\n\nmy suitcase wasn't new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. i worried that delta air lines, which i was flying the next day out of dallas, wouldn't accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.\n\nsouthwest baggage representatives in dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn't doubt i needed a new bag. but they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (i never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)\n\nthey asked how old my bag was, where i purchased it and how much i paid for it. they took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. they couldn't find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. i didn't recall how much my bag was or where i purchased it but estimated it at between $150 and $200. a repair never came up.\n\nthen, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. one was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. the hardside bag wouldn't fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so i initially passed.\n\namerican's ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. she ordered a bunch for american for the busy holiday season. many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.\n\ni was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.\n\nsouthwest said they would reimburse me if i bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of dallas the next morning. i didn't have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.\n\nin the middle of the baggage claim office, i unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.\n\ni wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport's uber pick-up area. i didn't make it. the wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.\n\ni fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn't work. they were apologetic, again. i repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.\n\nsouthwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag i bought, never setting a price limit. i didn't buy one in dallas; a generous friend i was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.\n\njust before christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, i bought a bag i'd had my eye on, a $245 away carry-on bag . it was nowhere near as big as the kenneth cole one southwest broke, but my friend's bag took care of my big-bag needs and i was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.\n\nmy claim was finally resolved the day after christmas in phoenix. i landed at sky harbor international airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from providence.\n\ni submitted my receipt for $260, which included taxes. it took the agents time to find my claim because i didn't have my damage incident report'' and they were having computer issues.\n\na supervisor offered $200, a figure noted in my report by the dallas agents. i told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.\n\nwe'll split the difference, how's that?'' she asked.\n\nat 1 a.m., i walked out of the office with a check for $225.\n\n5 things to do if an airline damages your bag\n\n1. head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. you have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. southwest and jetblue require claims within four hours; frontier, 12 hours. it's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.\n\n2. don't rip off your baggage tags. the airline will need them.\n\n3. be calm and courteous. a banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn't going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.\n\n4. know the approximate value of your bag and where you purchased it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.\n\n5. jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it's not resolved immediately. airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. not getting the answers you want? ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline's central baggage services office.\n\nmajor airline policies on damaged bags:\n\nalaska airlines\n\nallegiant air\n\namerican airlines\n\ndelta air lines\n\nfrontier airlines\n\njetblue airways\n\nsouthwest airlines\n\nspirit airlines\n\nunited airlines\n\nmore:travel nightmares: what to do if you miss your flight
washington – president donald trump walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders wednesday and said he might declare a national emergency at the border after democrats refused to yield to his demands for money for a border wall.\n\nsenate minority leader charles schumer, d-n.y., said trump abruptly ended the white house session after house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., said she did not support his border wall.\n\nhe just got up and said we have nothing to discuss, and he walked out, schumer said. he just walked out of the meeting.\n\nschumer called trump's behavior unbecoming of a president.\n\nvice president mike pence and republican lawmakers disputed the democrats' account and said the meeting ended after democrats refused to offer a counterplan to reopen the government.\n\ntrump gave schumer and pelosi the floor to state their case, but they want to argue, said house gop leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif.\n\ntrump treated the democrats politely, mccarthy said, but they reacted with embarrassing behavior.\n\ntrump confirmed that he walked out of the session, writing on twitter, just left a meeting with chuck and nancy, a total waste of time. i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up, are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said, no. i said bye-bye, nothing else works!\n\nthe end of what was supposed to be a new round of bipartisan talks came on the 19th day of a partial government shutdown – the second-longest in history – that was triggered by trump's demands for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the u.s.-mexican border and democrats' refusal to give him the money.\n\nearlier wednesday, trump said he was still considering declaring a national emergency on the border if negotiations with democrats fail to yield a deal on funding for the wall.\n\ni think we might work a deal (on the government shutdown), and if we don't, i may go that route, he said. i have the absolute right to do (a) national emergency if i want. … my threshold will be if i can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\n\nan emergency declaration theoretically would allow trump to use military money to build the wall. democrats and some republicans have questioned the legality of such a move, saying an emergency declaration would be challenged in court.\n\nbefore wednesday's failed bipartisan meeting, trump and pence traveled to the capitol for a closed-door luncheon with senate republicans.\n\nafterward, trump reiterated that he might pursue a national emergency declaration to get funding for his wall if democrats don't agree with the fact that our country really has problems with crime.\n\ntrump portrayed a sense of unity among republicans, though some have suggested opening portions of the government while negotiations over the wall continue.\n\nthere was no discussion about anything other than solidarity, trump said. the republicans are totally unified.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., also stressed that republicans remain solidly behind trump in the budget standoff. but at least three gop senators – cory gardner of colorado, susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska – have publicly said the senate should at least consider a house plan to reopen the government.\n\nthe operations of the department of interior and the national park service or the operations of the irs and whether or not tax refunds go out don't have anything to do with border security, murkowski said tuesday. so let's bifurcate these issues. let's set them aside. let's allow for the operations, these governmental functions in these six other departments, allow for them to continue.\n\nthe house of representatives voted 240-188 wednesday to approve a bill that would fund the treasury department and the irs so americans' tax refunds wouldn't be delayed because of the shutdown. eight republicans voted with democrats to pass the bill.\n\nthe house will take up three bills to fund the remaining shuttered departments this week. none of the measures is likely to get a vote in the gop-controlled senate.\n\nthe white house threatened to veto all four bills, saying they are unacceptable without a broader agreement to address the situation on the border.\n\ncontributing: deborah barfield berry, christal hayes and trevor hughes
washington – the warnings about climate change are dire: bigger floods, larger fires, larger storms.\n\nmost experts agree there's little to prevent these catastrophes without swift action on climate change.\n\nenter rep. kathy castor, the florida democrat that house speaker nancy pelosi has chosen to chair the new select committee on the climate crisis.\n\na capitol hill veteran and clean energy champion with a background as an environmental lawyer, the tampa democrat plans to shine a light on the very climate issues many democratic candidates ran on in november to win back the house.\n\nover the next 15 months, the panel will make policy recommendations, push for legislation and cast a spotlight on the growing dangers of man-made global warming that's spelled out in a chilling a federal report released in november.\n\nwe are in a race against time, castor, 52, told usa today recently.\n\nthe committee already faces obstacles:\n\n• republicans, who have consistently downplayed the effects of climate change, say the panel is unfairly partisan (nine democrats vs. six republicans).\n\n• progressives, who support a comprehensive approach known as the green new deal, worry the committee won't be aggressive enough.\n\nthe panel will only be able to do so much.\n\nit won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. it ultimately will have to rely on standing committees to adopt its recommendations. and any ambitious measures are unlikely to win passage in the republican-held senate or be signed by president donald trump who has dismissed global warming as a hoax and made environmental deregulation a cornerstone of his economic agenda.\n\ncastor spoke with usa today about the charge of her committee and the challenges it faces:\n\nq: much of the information on climate change is out there. so what do you hope to accomplish with this new committee?\n\ncastor: we're going to press for dramatic carbon pollution reduction. we want to win the clean energy future to defend the american way of life and avoid catastrophic and costly weather events that have dire impacts.\n\nq: what are some of the issues you want to pursue and how will you work with the standing congressional committee to achieve them?\n\ncastor:right off the bat, we will tackle fuel economy standards, make sure the commerce committee and the (transportation and infrastructure committee) are focused on that. the financial services committee has to do a flood insurance reform bill. we will be involved in that as well.\n\nq: you mentioned flood insurance. representing a coastal district, you know what flooding and storms can do. should we rebuild along the shore?\n\ncastor: we shouldn't be insuring at taxpayer expense homes and businesses that have been destroyed repeatedly on the shore. folks know full well that they're in hurricane's path or flood's path and they do that on their own. i'm concerned the (flood) maps are not up-to-date, that states and local communities are not acting fast enough to adopt policies to revise maps.\n\nq: is there a concern you may getting in the way of standing committees who are already charged with environmental protection and climate change issues?\n\ncastor: no, we're going to be complimentary. this is a collaborative effort. it's just being elevated because the threat to our way of life is at stake. it's all hands on deck.\n\nq: what's your response to republicans who say the panel will be stacked with democrats and have too much latitude to go after issues beyond its scope?\n\ncastor: look, we've had so much delay and republicans have had their heads in the sand here in the congress. i've just been through a time in the minority on (the) energy and commerce (committee) where they refused to have even one hearing on the climate or hear any legislation dealing with the escalating cost of climate of extreme weather events. and i do see our jurisdiction as being very broad. we're talking about the planet.\n\nq: how will the committee go about highlighting the consequences of climate change?\n\ncastor: we intend to tell the stories of communities that are taking action despite the inaction from the congress and the trump administration. there are some conservative, rural areas that are going renewable and reducing carbon pollution and we're going to shine a light on their good work. and for bad actors that know better, we intend to make sure they're famous as well.\n\nq: even if the house passes ambitious measures, their chance of becoming law is slim given the positions of the president and the senate. so why try?\n\ncastor: we don't have time to wait. whatever we can press to accomplish as soon as possible, we will do that.\n\nthe politics:climate change: democrats see trump, gop inaction as 2020 opportunity\n\nrelated:once democrats take charge of the house, addressing climate change will become top priority again
washington — a presidential candidate is accused of arranging hush money to conceal a mistress in a sensational story ripped straight from the tabloids.\n\nsound familiar?\n\nsix years ago, federal prosecutors put two-time democratic presidential contender john edwards on trial for just that and ended up failing to convict the north carolina politician. now, the common cause watchdog group wants the justice department, the federal election commission and congress to investigate a $130,000 payment that president trump's lawyer is alleged to have arranged weeks before the 2016 election for a former porn actress in an attempt to cover up her purported affair with trump.\n\ncampaign-finance experts say these cases are tricky to prove, and washington politics — the justice department, the federal election commission and congress are all controlled by the president's party — seem likely to doom any probe into whether federal laws were violated.\n\ni have real doubts that the department of justice has the independence and the fortitude to go after this, said peter zeidenberg, who served as a prosecutor in the justice department's public integrity section during george w. bush's administration.\n\nattorney general jeff session's decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and the russian government in the 2016 election already has caused a deep rift in his relationship with trump.\n\nmore:attorney general jeff sessions interviewed by mueller's team as part of russia investigation\n\ni think jeff sessions is scared to death about losing his job, zeidenberg said. he's trying to curry favor with the president at every turn, and i think that he would think that this a bridge too far for his agency to investigate the reported payment.\n\nin its complaints to the justice department and the federal election commission (fec), common cause argues that the alleged payment to stephanie clifford, whose stage name is stormy daniels, likely violated federal campaign-finance laws as an unreported, in-kind donation to trump's campaign.\n\ncampaign contribution limits in effect during the 2016 election capped direct donations to a candidates at $2,700 for a primary or general election. in addition, corporations are prohibited from giving campaign donations to congressional and presidential candidates.\n\non tuesday, common cause also sent a letter to the house and senate judiciary committees, asking them to take up the matter.\n\njustice department officials did not immediately respond tuesday to an inquiry about the common cause request. an fec spokesman said agency officials cannot comment on complaints.\n\nmichael cohen, trump's longtime lawyer identified by the wall street journal as having arranged the payment to the actress through a limited liability company, said the complaints lack merit.\n\nthe common cause complaint is baseless along with the allegation that president trump filed a false report to the f.e.c., cohen said in an emailed statement.\n\nin an earlier statement, cohen has said the president vehemently denies a relationship with daniels. cohen also released a statement from daniels denying an affair or the receipt of a payoff from trump.\n\nthe journal unearthed a corporate document showing that cohen created a limited liability company, essential consultants llc, in delaware on oct. 17, 2016, less than a month before the election. a bank account linked to that company sent the payment to the client-trust account of daniels' attorney, the newspaper reported.\n\nlast week, gossip magazine in touch weekly ran a previously unpublished interview with daniels from 2011 who described an affair with trump that began in 2006, a year after he had married melania trump.\n\nthe wall street journal reported that the alleged payment to daniels came in october 2016 as trump's campaign grappled with release of an access hollywood tape in which trump talked about groping women. daniels also had been in talks with abc's good morning america that fall to discuss trump, the journal reported.\n\nthe timing of this payment is strong evidence that this was payment for the purpose of influencing an election, rather than concealing the affair from trump's family, said paul ryan, common cause's vice president for policy and litigation.\n\nit was a decade-old relationship he had with her, ryan said of the alleged affair. so, why then?\n\nmore:porn star stormy daniels' alleged affair with trump takes new twist with old interview\n\nmore:analysis: why the latest allegations of a trump affair are unlikely to hurt the tabloid president\n\nin edwards' case, his lawyers argued $1 million in secret payments to edwards' pregnant mistress by edwards' donors were aimed at shielding his wife, elizabeth, who died of cancer in 2010, not hiding the information from voters.\n\nthe six-week corruption trial against edwards ended with acquittal on one count, and the jury deadlocked on five other charges.the justice department opted not to retry him.\n\nthese are fact-sensitive cases that are tough to prove, kenneth gross, a veteran campaign-finance lawyer, said tuesday. you have to get to the bottom of where the money came from and what was the intent of the payment.\n\nat the federal election commission, which often deadlocks along party lines, commissioners would have to vote to open a campaign-finance investigation. and a vacancy on the commission has left republicans in the majority.\n\neven as ryan argued for the investigations, he acknowledged that the politics make this tough.\n\nthe fec has been for years mired in dysfunction and now has a republican majority of commissioners, he said, and the doj (department of justice) is within the executive branch of government headed by the president.
maurie backman\n\nthe motley fool\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story cited the wrong source for data about anxiety americans face over finances. the original data came from moneylion.com.\n\nall things considered, now is a pretty good time to be an active participant in the u.s. economy.\n\njobs are plentiful. the market has been on a winning streak. and while rising interest rates are a mixed bag, savers can at least rest easy knowing their emergency cash will soon start to earn just a bit more.\n\nit's somewhat surprising, then, to learn that despite all of these factors, more adults have a negative financial outlook than a positive one. in a recent gobankingrates report that cited moneylion.com data, 28% of americans say they feel anxious about their finances, compared with just 19% who feel optimistic. and that's a pretty startling pill to swallow, especially since most americans also believe they'll earn more money in 2018 than they previously did.\n\nwhy are americans so anxious? in a previous gobankingrates survey, the reasons boiled down to never being able to retire, always living paycheck-to-paycheck, and being in debt forever. but if those are the issues at play here, there are some solutions that can help.\n\nnever managing to retire\n\nafter a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. but a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. in fact, nearly half of u.s. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the economic policy institute. and that's a problem, because social security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. neither is ideal.\n\nthe solution? start saving now, even if in small increments. the beauty of investing your retirement savings (which both iras and 401(k)s allow for) is that you have the ability to turn a series of relatively modest contributions into a rather impressive sum over time.\n\ncheck out the following table, which shows what saving just $300 a month consistently can do for your nest egg:\n\nif you start saving $300 a month at age: here's what you'll have by age 65 (assumes an average annual 8% return): 25 $932,000 30 $620,000 35 $408,000 40 $263,000 45 $165,000 50 $98,000\n\ndata source: author.\n\nof course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an ira or 401(k). for the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. for the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.\n\nliving paycheck-to-paycheck\n\na big reason americans are stuck living paycheck to paycheck is their tendency to save too little and spend too much. if you'd rather break that cycle, then here's what you need to do. first, create a budget, which will help you see where your money is going and how much room for savings your expenses allow for. only once you have that budget in place will you be in a good position to identify which bills to slash.\n\nand that leads to the second thing you'll need to do, which is start cutting expenses if your current budget doesn't allow you to save at least 10% of your paycheck month after month. whether you choose to reduce one major expense, like your home, or a series of smaller ones, like your cable bill and takeout habit, is up to you. but you will need to lower your spending if you're tired of the paycheck to paycheck routine.\n\none additional option you can also consider is picking up some sort of side hustle. though it's not easy swinging a second gig on top of a full-time job, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can boost your income and use that extra money to pad your savings account. furthermore, working that extra job might give you the flexibility to cut fewer expenses, thus contributing to a better quality of life.\n\nmore: only 39% of americans are ready for a $1,000 unexpected expense\n\nmore: millennials: 1 in 6 now have $100,000 socked away\n\nmore: retirement planning: 18 frequently asked 401(k) questions\n\ndying in debt\n\nnever managing to get out of debt is a valid concern, especially since the average household carrying a balance is on the hook for a whopping $16,000. still, there's no need to resign yourself to taking that debt with you to the grave, especially if you're willing to make an effort to pay it off.\n\nhow? it's simple -- just employ the same tactics. trim expenses from your budget, work extra, and free up cash to apply to your debt. from there, pay the bills that are costing you the most in interest, and work your way down. you can also look into a balance transfer, which may be a good option if your credit itself is relatively strong despite your debt.\n\nif you're starting 2018 with a relatively negative financial outlook, here's your chance to turn things around. you can salvage your retirement, stop living paycheck-to-paycheck, and break free from the evil cycle of debt. you just need to shift your priorities a little and start making changes for the better.\n\nthe motley fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nthe motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives. its content is produced independently of usa today.\n\noffer from the motley fool:the $16,122 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nif you're like most americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. but a handful of little-known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. for example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year! once you learn how to maximize your social security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after. simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies.
kim tong-hyung\n\nassociated press\n\nseoul, south korea – north korea's acting ambassador to italy, jo song gil, went into hiding with his wife in november, south korea's spy agency told lawmakers in seoul on thursday. a high-profile defection by one of north korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader kim jong un as he pursues diplomacy with seoul and washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.\n\nsouth korean lawmaker kim min-ki said an official from seoul's national intelligence service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. kim did not say whether the spy agency revealed any information about jo's current whereabouts or whether the diplomat had plans to defect to south korea. kim said the nis said it has not been contacted by jo.\n\nkim said the nis official said that jo and his wife left the official residence in early november, weeks before his term was to end in late november. kim said he couldn't confirm whether the nis official revealed whether jo and his wife were accompanied by any children. the nis earlier said it couldn't confirm a south korean media report that jo was under the protection of the italian government as he seeks asylum in a western nation.\n\nnorth korea has not yet commented on jo's status.\n\nan official with the italian foreign ministry said the north korean hadn't requested asylum from italy. the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standard practice, said jo no longer held diplomatic status in italy. that presumably refers to his government's ending his diplomatic assignment to italy and his being recalled.\n\nnorth korea, which touts itself in its propaganda as a socialist paradise, is extremely sensitive about defections, especially among its elite diplomatic corps, and has previously insisted that they are south korean or u.s. plots to undermine its government.\n\nnorth korea may publicly ignore jo's possible defection or hold back harsh criticism to avoid highlighting the vulnerability of its government as it pursues diplomacy with washington and seoul, said koh yu-hwan, a north korea expert at seoul's dongguk university.\n\nthe last senior north korean diplomat known to have defected is thae yong ho, a former minister at the north korean embassy in london, who fled to south korea in 2016.\n\nwhile not identifying him by name, the north's state media then described thae as human scum and claimed he was trying to escape punishment for serious crimes.\n\nthae, who has been an outspoken critic of kim jong un while living in south korea, denied the accusations and said he defected because he didn't want his children to live miserable lives in the north.\n\nit's possible that jo is trying to defect because of similar reasons, said koh, who is a policy adviser for south korean president moon jae-in. it could be difficult for some diplomats to accept being called back to the north after enjoying years living in the free west. they could want their children to live in a different system and receive better education.\n\nthe highest-level north korean to seek asylum in south korea is hwang jang-yop, a senior ruling workers' party official who once tutored kim jong un's late father, dictator kim jong il.\n\nhwang's 1997 defection was hailed by many south koreans as an intelligence bonanza. hwang died in 2010.\n\nin 1997, the north korean ambassador to egypt fled and resettled in the united states.\n\nnot much is publicly known about jo, who had been north korea's acting ambassador to rome after italy expelled then-ambassador mun jong nam in october 2017 to protest a north korean nuclear test.\n\nkim, the lawmaker who listened to the spy agency's briefing, said the nis official said the agency has yet to figure out many details about jo.\n\nabout 30,000 north koreans have defected to south korea since the end of the 1950-53 korean war, according to south korean government figures. many defectors have said they wanted to leave north korea's harsh political system and poverty. north korea often accuses the south of deceiving or paying people to defect, or claims that they have been kidnapped.
jeffrey ball\n\nopinion contributor\n\nit seems a sensible solution: to slash emissions of the greenhouse gases dangerously warming the planet, force polluters to pay for what they cough out. slapping a price on carbon, the argument goes, should prod companies and consumers to go green, from electric cars to renewable energy to diets lower in meat.\n\nbut mounting evidence suggests that carbon prices are like unicorns and fairy dust: dazzling in concept and all but meaningless in practice.\n\nmore states, regions and countries than ever are putting prices on carbon emissions. europe has done it, certain u.s. states have done it, canada is doing it, and china, the world's biggest emitter, is moving to do it. yet global emissions are surging to new highs.\n\nour view:greenhouse gases blowing the wrong way for america\n\none-fifth of all global emissions, the world bank says, are now subject to a carbon price — either a tax or a market in mandatory pollution permits known as cap-and-trade. nevertheless, energy-related carbon emissions jumped 1.6 percent in 2017, according to the international energy agency, and they likely rose more in 2018.\n\nwhy aren't carbon prices curbing global warming? they tend to constrain emissions only in certain parts of the economy. and even there, politicians tend to lack the guts to set the prices high enough to change much. little wonder that, according to world bank figures, less than 1 percent of global emissions are subject to a carbon price that economists believe is high enough to change much.\n\nso carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive. by providing the illusion that they're effectively dealing with climate change, they reduce pressure for tougher policies that could meaningfully curb emissions, such as phasing out coal as an electricity fuel except where it's paired with carbon-capture technology; maintaining existing nuclear plants; and making renewable energy cheaper.\n\nclimate change, an existential challenge, deserves a massive response. in the future, perhaps carbon pricing will work. so far, it looks like a diversion.\n\njeffrey ball is scholar-in-residence at stanford university's steyer-taylor center for energy policy and finance. for a fuller discussion, read his 2018 essay in foreign affairs, why carbon pricing isn't working. follow him on twitter: @jeff_ball\n\nif you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.

and, if not, how do i get my money back?\n\n'an expensive gamble'\n\nextended warranties, often called vehicle service contracts, are sold by the finance and insurance manager while creating your sales contract. these warranties cover repair costs for varying lengths of time or miles driven after the manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper warranty ends.\n\nthere are factory warranties, backed by the carmaker, with repairs made using original manufacturer parts, as well as third-party warranties that often require you to request a reimbursement and use after-market parts.\n\nconsumer reports, calling extended warranties an expensive gamble, found the median price for coverage was just over $1,200. the results of the 2013 survey, its most recent, showed that 55 percent of owners who purchased an extended warranty didn't use it. and those who did use it spent hundreds more for the coverage than they saved in repair costs, on average, the survey found.\n\nmore:these 6 vehicles were the hottest-selling cars of 2018: jeep, toyota, tesla make the list\n\nandy meisler, a retired journalist in los angeles, was offered an extended warranty when buying a toyota prius but he decided not to take that bet.\n\nafter driving the car for 10 years, meisler said, that car never needed more than routine maintenance. and our warranty-less state never cost us a bit of sleep.\n\nreasons to cancel\n\nalthough an extended warranty is portrayed as protection against costly future repairs, here are a few scenarios that might make you decide to cancel it:\n\nnonagreement : some buyers discover that an extended warranty was slipped into their car financing contract without their knowledge or agreement. then, the term of the loan is extended to hide the extra expense.\n\n: some buyers discover that an extended warranty was slipped into their car financing contract without their knowledge or agreement. then, the term of the loan is extended to hide the extra expense. cost : often sold as a per-month purchase, some buyers later total the cost of the warranty over the length of the contract and discover it's much more expensive than they were led to believe.\n\n: often sold as a per-month purchase, some buyers later total the cost of the warranty over the length of the contract and discover it's much more expensive than they were led to believe. exclusions : extended warranties don't cover everything that can go wrong. after reading the fine print, some car owners decide the coverage doesn't justify the cost.\n\n: extended warranties don't cover everything that can go wrong. after reading the fine print, some car owners decide the coverage doesn't justify the cost. postponement: if you bought a new car, the extended warranty doesn't kick in for at least three years. some people would prefer to keep that money in their pocket – at least for now.\n\nmore:would you buy a car from a carvana vending machine?

phoenix — the same week the trump administration opened a hotline in april to support victims of crimes by immigrants, elena maria lopez called to report a complaint against her ex-husband.\n\nat first, lopez kept getting a busy signal.\n\nbut finally someone answered. for the next 20 minutes, lopez provided a detailed account, accusing the dutch immigrant of marrying her to get a green card and then threatening to harm her if she contacted immigration officials.\n\nwhat happened next shocked lopez.\n\n► jan. 19:the worst states economically for hispanics and latinos\n\n► jan. 17:deportation of ohio woman was in error, appeals court says\n\n► jan. 16:can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? yes.\n\nnot only did immigration and customs enforcement, the agency that operates the hotline, decline to take action, but immigration authorities also released much of the private information she provided. this includes a confidential internet phone number she fears will now make it easier for anyone to locate her in new jersey, where she has a protected address set up for domestic-violence victims.\n\nlopez is one of hundreds of people whose private information was inappropriately released by ice when the agency posted call logs to the hotline on its website, a clear violation of the agency's own policies against divulging private information as well as privacy laws intended to protect individuals who provide sensitive information to the government.\n\n► jan. 13:chicago pays tribute to its haitian founder after trump vulgarity\n\n► jan. 13:federal government begins accepting daca renewals\n\nthe agency also released some of the same information to the arizona republic in response to a freedom of information act request.\n\nlopez contacted the newspaper after ice officials notified her through telephone calls and emails that private information she provided in confidence was inadvertently released to the newspaper.\n\ni was very upset because i do my best to protect my privacy for my safety and i was especially upset that it was the department of homeland security that gave out my personal information, she said. the same agency that claimed it had to protect my ex-husband's rights just destroyed my privacy and my safety.\n\n'this is a serious problem'\n\nthe agency's release of private information underscores problems that have surfaced since ice launched the victims of immigration crime engagement office, or voice, to serve the needs of crime victims and their families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration.\n\nthe office includes a telephone hotline that was not intended to report crimes but to answer questions from victims, according to the voice website. instead, callers have treated it has a crime hotline, using it largely to accuse people of being in the country illegally or of violating immigration laws, according to telephone logs the agency released the republic.\n\nthis is a serious problem and obviously will further discourage people from attempting to interact in any way with the federal government on immigration matters, said immigration policy analyst david bier at the cato institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nvictims and witnesses of crimes already are hesitant to provide information to the government because having that information out in the public could pose a serious threat to them and to their family, he said.\n\npresident trump called for the creation of the voice program in an executive order on immigration in january 2016, which directed the department of homeland security and ice to take a tougher stance on illegal immigration and immigration-law violators.\n\nin a written statement, ice officials admitted that the agency erred in divulging private information protected by policy and law.\n\nwhen the agency receives evidence suggesting that non-releasable information is unintentionally available, immediate actions are taken to ensure proper mitigation both to correct and to prevent further disclosures, the statement said.\n\nthose action include temporarily removing and reviewing the entire contents of ice's freedom of information act library, the statement said. the library contained thousands of pages of data and documents the agency previously had released in response to requests.\n\n► jan. 8:trump orders 200,000 salvadorans to leave u.s.\n\n► jan. 5:man gets 9 months in deaths of 5 mexican immigrants in basement\n\nthe contents of ice's freedom of information act library were restored oct. 16, the agency said.\n\nthe agency also offered identity-threat monitoring services to people affected because of the improper disclosure of private information, the statement said.\n\nlopez said ice offered her two years of identity-theft protection and credit monitoring.\n\nin truth, that does nothing for me, lopez said.\n\nclaims of immigration fraud\n\nlopez said she became hopeful when trump said he was creating the voice office.\n\nfor more a decade, she said she has tried unsuccessfully to get immigration authorities to investigate her ex-husband, erik niehof, a dutch immigrant. he disputes her allegations accusing him of marriage fraud and domestic violence.\n\nlopez is also the creator of a website, immigrationfraud.com, which provides a forum for victims of marriage fraud.\n\nin march, lopez testified before the senate judiciary committee during a hearing into marriage and fiancé visa fraud, describing how she was tricked by the love of my life into getting married.\n\nthen out of the blue, on the night of our second anniversary, he coldly announced we were divorcing. i assumed we were just having marriage problems, suggested counseling.\n\n\n\nhe flat out refused. and then came the cruelest words i've ever heard: … he said our marriage was nothing but a practicality so he could get a green card.\n\nlopez further testified that her ex-husband became violent after learning she had filed for separation and planned to withdraw her immigration sponsorship for his green card.\n\nhe tried to strangle me and threatened to kill me if i ever contacted immigration officials, she testified.\n\nshe also accused her husband of being involved in criminal activity in the netherlands and claimed he never should have cleared department of homeland security background checks and allowed into the united states.\n\n► dec. 6:illegal crossings at u.s.-mexico border hit historic low\n\n► nov. 30:undocumented immigrant not guilty of murder in polarizing case\n\nafter reporting the allegations to the voice hotline, she said she received a call from a caseworker who told her they could not do anything.\n\nthey concluded they couldn't get involved in order to protect his privacy rights, lopez said, adding that the caseworker suggested she call a department of homeland security tip line.\n\nreached in pennsylvania, where he works selling cars at a luxury auto dealership, niehof strongly disputed lopez allegations. now remarried, with a child, he accused lopez of continuing to pursue false claims of marriage fraud and domestic violence against him and inventing stories about his nonexistent criminal past in the netherlands out of vengeance after their marriage fell apart 16 years ago.\n\nbasically, this was just a marriage that ended up really bad, and, 'i am going to get back at you and i am going to do that through immigration service,'  niehof said of lopez. this is her vengeance.\n\nniehof said originally he didn't want to move to the u.s. but agreed to apply for a visa and get married after his ex-wife visited him in the netherlands when they were dating but didn't want to live there.\n\nhe said immigration authorities have sworn affidavits from mutual friends that their marriage was entered in good faith.\n\nhe also said immigration authorities have investigated lopez's claims against him several times and concluded they were unfounded when he applied for permanent residency in 2002 and then to renew his green card 10 years later, pointing out that he was approved both times.\n\nin 2016, niehof said u.s. immigration officers briefly detained him upon returning from a vacation abroad with his family after his immigration record was flagged because of his ex-wife's allegations. while he waited, immigration officers looked into his record, then welcomed him back into the u.s., which he said would not have happened if any of her allegations were true.\n\nthat is probably why (immigration authorities) haven't made a case of this because there is no validity in any of it, he said. she is out for vengeance.\n\nrecords inadvertently released\n\namong the private information included in the database ice released to the republic was niehof's personal immigration identification number, known as an a number, along with the name and address of the auto dealership where he works.\n\n• on july 31,the republic filed a freedom of information act request request for any and all criminal activity reported to the voice hotline.\n\n• on sept. 8, in response, immigration and customs enforcement provided a microsoft excel spreadsheet via email containing ice call logs of 643 people who called the voice hotline.\n\n• on oct. 4,the republic received a clawback response letter from erin clifford, chief of ice's government information law division, alerting the newspaper that records released contained personally identifiable information of third parties, law enforcement sensitive information, and potentially deliberative information.\n\nthe letter concluded by asking the newspaper to confirm that you have returned, destroyed or sequestered all copies of the record and to provide ice with a list of any disclosures that have been made.\n\nconfusion over hotline's purpose\n\na review of the call logs released shows that many people contacted the hotline to turn in acquaintances, spouses, relatives, neighbors, and business owners they suspected of being in the country illegally or of having committed crimes.\n\nhowever, ice's webpage describing the purpose of the voice program explicitly states that the hotline is not to report crime. it directs callers to report crimes to local police or ice's designated crime hotline.\n\nsummaries of the call logs that ice released included names of crime victims, addresses, and phone numbers as well as names, addresses, places of employment, phone numbers and a-numbers of immigrants being accused of crimes or of being in the country illegally.\n\nfor example, one summary reads: caller requested to report a possible illegal immigrant who may have an order of deportation. caller stated the illegal immigrant abuses her children. caller stated the illegal immigrant is his neighbor and she lives at (street address), perth amboy, nj.\n\nanother summary reads: caller requested to report business who hires undocumented aliens. caller claims there are approximately eight undocumented aliens at this farm located at: (street address), north olmstead, ohio. 44138.\n\nthe call logs also show the hotline has received numerous prank calls such as this one: caller requested to report an alien outside his house and has green skin color.\n\nand this one: caller identified himself as a victim. caller then requested assistance reporting an illegal alien. caller provided the name gabba tha hut and address as 1600 pennsylvania, washington, d.c. that is the address of the white house.\n\ndoes program have ulterior motive?\n\nbier of the cato institute said he supports government efforts to provide more information about cases to crime victims as well as informing them of other services available.\n\ni was torn about the program in general when it was first announced because i honestly believe we treat victims in the united states of crimes very poorly, he said. we give them very little information about what's happening in the case. as a general rule, we as a society need to treat victims much better than we do now.\n\n► nov. 23:ms-13 gang member arrested after murder victim stabbed over 100 times\n\n► nov. 3:islamic state claims responsibility for nyc terror attack without evidence\n\nbut the program's problems and its narrow focus only on victims of crimes committed by immigrants suggests the program has ulterior motives, he said.\n\nthe administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, bier said. i think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. so i think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.\n\n► oct. 30:man deported by ice after helping detroit cops\n\n► oct. 28:no social security number? no electricity\n\nfor her part, lopez said she now completely has lost faith in ice after the agency declined to look into her case and then released private information she provided.\n\nthis is just one more example of how dysfunctional the department of homeland security is, lopez said.\n\ncontributing: ryan santistevan and agnel philip, the arizona republic. follow daniel gonzález on twitter: @azdangonzalez
protecting the shield: read our investigative series\n\nphilip seidle hates being called a killer cop.\n\nthe former neptune police sergeant spends his days mostly alone, locked in a maximum-security cell at new jersey state prison, the facility for the state's toughest inmates.\n\nit is true i killed and i was a police officer, seidle wrote in an online message to the asbury park press following a november court hearing in which a headline termed him a killer cop.\n\ninteractive graphic: scroll towards the end of the story to explore the chain of events between seidle and police officers during the shooting.\n\nthat particular phrase chaffed him. the term is unnecessary, seidle wrote. it feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.\n\nonce entrusted with a badge and a gun to protect the town he called home, seidle, 53, is no longer trusted with a real pen.\n\nin evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the press in the summer to discuss his crime. the prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. the floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.\n\ni killed my wife, and the mother of my children, the most horrific thing, seidle wrote. i destroyed my children's lives. what i did is absolutely unacceptable. i can't forgive myself, and don't hold out any hope they ever will.\n\nexclusively for insiders: philip seidle's thoughts - inside the mind of a killer cop\n\nseidle also spoke exclusively to the press through phone calls facilitated by his one-time mistress. they still tell each other i love you on the calls.\n\nseidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, tamara wilson-seidle on june 16, 2015, in the middle of an asbury park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.\n\ni just think i had a mental breakdown. i just – because of all the stress that i was under and the anger that i had, seidle said. i just blacked out that day.\n\nsigns of domestic problems in the seidle home were long known to seidle's colleagues, his supervisors, his chief, neighboring police departments, and the monmouth county prosecutor's office, documents and interviews show.\n\nseidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. his .40-caliber glock, though, was returned to him. it was the weapon he used to gun down tamara.\n\nin his 22-year career, seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.\n\nhis secret internal affairs file tops 600 pages.\n\nthe press is suing neptune to make the file public. a judge could decide the matter next month.\n\nwhat is known is that police responded to at least nine domestic incidents between the seidles and 10 custody disputes – with police providing an escort during at least one custody confrontation.\n\nseidle shared his psychologist's notes that detail the emotional devastation he said he felt during the custody battle with his ex-wife. both seidle and his ex-wife filed for domestic violence restraining orders, alleging past abuse.\n\nthis is a story about the two phil seidles.\n\nin the community, seidle was known as an upstanding officer – respected by citizens, looked up to by colleagues, a loving father of nine.\n\nbut beneath that public persona, seidle's stress and frustration were no secret to his colleagues and supervisors. both he and his ex-wife made claims of domestic violence.\n\nseidle denied claims that he abused his ex-wife.\n\ntamara did not become a victim until i killed her that day, he wrote.\n\nthe seidles' multiple domestic disputes were handled by authorities as isolated incidents, not looked at as a continuing pattern, public police records show.\n\nthe domestic issues caused seidle to be suspended from his department at least twice and disarmed at least once, records show. seidle said he was also disarmed a second time. he was sent by his department for psychological review at least three times.\n\nyet seidle returned to duty, armed and frustrated.\n\ntamara's death at age 51 left their nine children without parents, prompted a multimillion-dollar legal claim by the kids and tainted the careers of two responding officers.\n\nborn in munich, west germany, tamara wilson-seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. she was a cheerleader and neptune high school homecoming queen in 1982. she coached soccer. she was a devout catholic, serving as director of religious education for the mother of mercy parish.\n\nwhen seidle was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, their eldest daughter described tamara as the soul and the light of their family.\n\nher killing shocked those in the community who knew seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.\n\nmonmouth county prosecutor chris gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. he issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. but that report excluded the seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove seidle to kill.\n\nseidle said he began to unravel during tamara's pursuit of child custody, which he felt rose to criminal interference. the day he killed her, he shouted about his kids as he stood in the street with his pistol to his head.\n\ni'm tired of it! i'm tired of it! i got nine f------ kids she stole from me! seidle ranted, all of it picked up on a police dash camera recording.\n\nseidle said he was devastated by his fraying relationship with his children and the warming relationship between tamara's new boyfriend and the seidle children.\n\nafter two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, seidle wrote in an online message. you continue trying, but nothing works. everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. perhaps you take it lightly? maybe you think i'm exaggerating? i'm not.\n\nyou tell me mr. ford. tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? i'm not saying it's right! i'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. that's all i'm saying. i want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. period. i want this idea that i was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. tamara should have been stopped! period. all i wanted was to share in my children's lives. if i had been allowed to, i'd have been fine. it was my right under every law on this earth, and i shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.\n\nseidle said he struggled to deal with stress at home. he said he should have been on medication, maybe an antidepressant or antianxiety drug. he should have moved away from the situation with his ex-wife.\n\nseidle's chief acknowledged investigations uncovered major problems with seidle, according to a court document.\n\none police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.\n\nbetween the work issues and the domestic violence complaints and the 911 calls to his house, someone, someone has to take the responsibility and tying all that together and saying there's a significant concern, said michael d'angelo, a retired police captain who served 23 years in south miami police department, including performing internal affairs duties, and now works as a consultant on civil cases involving police.\n\nmore than three years before the shooting, tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by seidle show. she claimed seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.\n\nthree years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in neptune and a sergeant in tinton falls when they handled a confrontation between the seidles, according to a police report. higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.\n\nless than a year before the shooting, seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children. he handed in his badge and gun. but seidle said his colleagues encouraged him to return. he was put back on the job and rearmed.\n\nless than four months before the shooting, seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. he claimed in court documents that tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. his restraining order wasn't granted either.\n\ntwo months before the shooting, seidle filed a criminal complaint alleging that tamara violated a judge's custody order by preventing seidle's visits and phone calls, the court document shows.\n\nsix days before the shooting, a letter shows bradley beach municipal court judge richard b. thompson found no probable cause for seidle's criminal complaint, saying the issue was a civil matter.\n\nthen on the morning of june 16, 2015, seidle learned tamara's new boyfriend had been spending time alone with the seidle children.\n\nseidle said he doesn't remember chasing tamara's car through the streets of asbury park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. he doesn't remember running tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. he doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.\n\nhe does remember confronting his ex-wife in a church parking lot.\n\nthen he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.\n\ni realized i had shot her, seidle said.\n\nseidle was born to unmarried parents in april 1964 in philadelphia.\n\nhe wrote that he felt his father abandoned the family.\n\nafter high school, i didn't believe myself to be disciplined enough to go to college. wanting to travel, i enlisted in the u.s. navy in july of 1982 at 18, he wrote.\n\ni met tamara in oct. of '89 through a mutual friend of ours, with whom i'd been stationed with onboard both (u.s.s) nitro and the philly commissary. we talked on the phone for several months and began dating in february of 1990. she became pregnant in april 1990…\n\nthey were both 26. they married in august 1990, in st. peter claver church in asbury park, court documents show. that's about half a mile from where seidle shot tamara.\n\nseidle was honorably discharged from the navy and hired by neptune township police department in july 1993.\n\nwithin a year of his hire, the department knew about seidle's trouble at home. in march 1994, seidle called neptune police after tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. but then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither seidle nor tamara filed a criminal complaint.\n\nyou know, there were a lot of problems, seidle said in a prison phone call. but we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.\n\nbound by catholic doctrine, the seidle marriage was a cycle of faith, sin and reconciliation. for decades, there were showdowns documented by police and later in court between the seidles, with each making allegations of domestic violence against the other.\n\ninternal affairs expert d'angelo reviewed the special report on the seidle shooting issued by prosecutor gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.\n\nsomewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – i don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, d'angelo said. you investigated your officer several times. if you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, i mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.\n\neven seidle acknowledged the repeated calls should have warranted further scrutiny, though he contends that his ex-wife was lying to the police.\n\nthe thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? he said. why is she constantly calling the police? why does she continue to call the police for these matters?\n\ngramiccioni's report underscores a failing in new jersey police policy.\n\nthis review and analysis disclosed a critical flaw in the domestic violence policies and procedures that currently exist statewide, the report stated. the report also raised concern with officers who are the subject of numerous internal affairs complaints.\n\ngramiccioni has since established an early warning system in which monmouth county departments are required to report to the prosecutor's office if an officer meets criteria like being involved in a domestic violence incident.\n\ngramiccioni's report was produced by his office after the new jersey attorney general's office found no conflict of interest with the prosecutor's office investigating. the report largely absolves those who oversaw seidle, including the prosecutor's office.\n\nwhile the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of tamara seidle. philip seidle did, gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. with hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented seidle from brutally killing tamara seidle on that fateful day in asbury park. it's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.\n\nseidle wrote from prison that gramiccioni was protecting his office from legal liability.\n\nthat declaration was for the civil suit, seidle wrote. and basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. they cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. i think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the attorney general's office allowed it.\n\nin an interview, the prosecutor's office limited its comments on seidle, pointing to the children's lawsuit.\n\nmany people surrounding the seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the seidle children in the lawsuit, the seidles' priest, the catholic diocese of trenton, the seidles' divorce attorneys, the neptune police chief, and former police director.\n\ndespite trouble at home, seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. he was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.\n\ni had a few bumps the first couple years, he wrote of his career. i had a number of car accidents (minor), and fell and cut my eye open. i studied on and off the job hard to learn the law, and how to survive on the streets as a proactive officer. i earned a reputation for being very knowledgeable in the law, and for making good arrests.\n\nseidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. he was credited for police work in asbury park press stories. he helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. while patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. he received a commendation from the 200 club of monmouth county – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.\n\nhe provided letters of support citizens wrote on his behalf.\n\nin the last week i had occasion to be in touch with your patrolman philip seidel (sic) on three occasions and i wanted to let you know that i found him to show good judgment and professionalism on each occasion, ruth e. buck, proprietor of the shelburne hotel, wrote in june 1994.\n\nseidle wrote often about his children. he was there for each of the nine births, he wrote. he coached sports, chaperoned class trips and attended their parent-teacher conferences and religious sacraments. seidle's younger half-brother provided photos of seidle with his kids at a wrestling match, a soccer game, in an ice cream shop.\n\nthere were many good times, seidle wrote. to most people on the outside, we had the perfect family, because we were always together. we did everything as a family…but the marriage was dysfunctional.\n\nand his department knew about that dysfunction.\n\nin 2001, police responded to a screaming match that escalated to tamara pushing seidle, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nproblems persisted, and worsened, seidle wrote.\n\ntamara stopped working to stay home with the kids after their sixth child was born, seidle wrote. she nearly died during the birth of their seventh child and underwent a gall bladder surgery in 2002, seidle wrote. she lost her mother and father within a year.\n\nshe shut down and stopped tending to her responsibilities, seidle wrote.\n\ntheir problems deepened, but still they stuck it out.\n\ni grew impatient over the next couple years, and in the later part of 2004, i had an extramarital affair, seidle wrote. it lasted three months. i ended it because i knew it was wrong, and did not want to continue to mislead my wife, and commit adultery.\n\nseidle wrote that he believed tamara also had an affair.\n\nthey went to marital counseling.\n\nseidle considered a separation in 2006, he wrote, but tamara was opposed to it. neptune police came to their home in march that year for a verbal dispute, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nby april 2010, i'd decided to leave, seidle wrote. i had told myself i would stay for the kids, and being a catholic, divorce was frowned upon. i was making an effort to live my faith. but i reached the point i resented being around her, and even living in my home.\n\nhe planned to leave in january 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. but in october 2010, tamara told him she had breast cancer.\n\nseidle helped tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.\n\nbut after an ordeal that might draw couples closer together, the seidles grew further apart.\n\nand then came more calls to the police.\n\nseidle began seeing gloria patricia chavarriaga. a divorce document filed on tamara's behalf claimed this happened during her cancer treatment, which ended in june 2011.\n\nchavarriaga told tinton falls police she suspected tamara once flattened four tires on chavarriaga's car because of who chavarriaga was dating, according to a december 2011 report. but tamara denied it and chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.\n\nseidle met chavarriaga through church. chavarriaga, 54, knew seidle for years professionally before they were involved romantically, she told a reporter. she was a single parent and seidle helped with her daughters. she admired the way seidle loved his children.\n\nthey walk straight, chavarriaga said of the children. they are good kids. that says a lot when children behave because obviously, someone is teaching them the right thing.\n\nseidle mentored chavarriaga's daughter, samantha rittman, who is now 24 and living in virginia beach.\n\nseidle was stern with rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, rittman recalled. he was supportive of rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.\n\nhe never turned his back on me, she said. ever.\n\nshe recalled that seidle was distressed about not being with his children.\n\nhe was constantly a mess over his kids, rittman said. that's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.\n\nrittman never expected violence from seidle, she said. seidle didn't seem like that kind of person.\n\ni was angry for a while, i was really angry, she said. angry because seidle hurt chavarriaga. he made chavarriaga happy and rittman thought they'd have a future together.\n\ni just feel like what he did was selfish, she said.\n\nseidle left tamara in january 2012, he wrote.\n\nprior to doing so, i took the six oldest (children) and spoke to them, telling them i was leaving because i was unhappy, and that their mom and i were not getting along, he wrote. i did nothing to embarrass either of us, and wanted to do nothing to make the children feel responsible, or be in the middle.\n\nthen there were two reports of domestic incidents involving seidle in january and february that year, according to the prosecutor's report. tinton falls police responded to a confrontation between seidle and one of chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. seidle provided the press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that seidle put his hands on her.\n\nsix days later, neptune township police responded to a confrontation at the seidle home. seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument. when police arrived, tamara made allegations of past abuse similar to claims she would make when she filed for divorce and for a restraining order. seidle said these were lies.\n\nseidle said tamara wanted to get back at him.\n\nshe wanted revenge for me leaving, he wrote. she knew there were two things important to me… my children and my reputation. she wanted to take away both of those things to hurt me the way i had hurt her by leaving.\n\nseidle was suspended for two days in february 2012 because his department felt he interfered with the police response. seidle said he was trying to make sure proper protocol was followed. seidle was sent to a police psychologist. seidle was deemed unfit for duty.\n\nseidle said he told the doctor that i was extremely upset by tamara's lies, and did not want to be at work during this time, as i would have trouble focusing.\n\nhe wrote that he was found unfit because he asked to be. his unfitness was not on any finding of psychological dysfunction, or disorder, seidle said.\n\nhe remained off duty until may 2012.\n\ni was ordered by my chief to 'stay away' from tammy for my 'own good,' he wrote of his return to work. then-police chief robert adams could not be reached for comment.\n\ntamara filed for divorce in june 2013, claiming abuse. seidle denied those claims in court and interviews.\n\ntamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the press, but the monmouth county prosecutor's office ignored them in its final report.\n\nallegations made by philip and tamara seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.\n\ntamara sought sole custody of the children. at the time, six were younger than 18. seidle was ordered in october 2013 to pay $3,000 in alimony and $2,606 in child support each month, based on earnings in 2012 worth $11,930 before taxes, according to a court document.\n\nseidle said the fight over child custody hurt him deeply.\n\ni couldn't cope, he wrote. i couldn't sleep, i couldn't concentrate. i suffered from depression, anger, anxiety, high blood pressure. i was a mess. my emotional well-being spiraled out of control.\n\npolice reports show neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the seidles, including a custody dispute. both seidles and the seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.\n\nbut gramiccioni's report made no mention of police escorts and set aside the calls for custody disputes, saying they do not constitute incidents of domestic violence.\n\nseidle explained how the fight over the children led to the ultimate tragedy.\n\nit went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, seidle said. that's where it went wrong. it was just a continuum. there was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… i love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. more than anything in the world i cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. i wanted to be the father that i never had.\n\nseidle provided notes from a psychologist, raymond hanbury, who counseled seidle and documented his struggle starting in 2012, after he was found unfit for duty by a department psychologist. hanbury didn't respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nhe does get emotional when he talks about his lack of contact with the children because tammy makes it difficult, hanbury wrote in an entry dated march 28, 2012.\n\nhanbury wrote in may 2014 that seidle's issues with tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current neptune police chief james hunt.\n\nseidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, hanbury wrote in november 2014.\n\ndivorce is finalized, hanbury wrote in an entry two weeks before the killing. however, he was upset with tammy because she reportedly threw his personal items out. they include navy papers, training certificates and personal items that meant something to him.\n\n\n\n'but they're gone,' the psychologist wrote, apparently quoting seidle. 'i need to focus on the children.'\n\n\n\nin an undated final entry, hanbury wrote: on june 16, phil shot his ex-wife, fatal, and was arrested. there were no indications or signs of something like this to happen. he denied in sessions that he would do anything to jeopardize his being with the children, especially the younger ones.\n\nseidle dismissed the effectiveness of the therapy.\n\nsending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, seidle wrote. i would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. so where was the healing to take place? tell me? every day i missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. there was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that i missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. my children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' not because i left, but for her malice.\n\nthe dispute over child custody led to more police calls to the seidle home, departmental discipline for seidle and rising tension between the seidles.\n\nif they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? seidle asked. doesn't matter whether i was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.\n\nlocal law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the seidle household.\n\nseidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.\n\ncapt. lawrence fisher was there for me in every way during this whole ordeal, seidle said. he saw me crying and things that went on with me emotionally when nobody else was around. fisher could not be reached for comment\n\nseidle said department supervisors knew of his problems.\n\nthe line supervisors, they were all aware, seidle said. they knew what was going on, they knew that there were problems…you know there were times that i came to work late. i reported late because i had to be, i was in court. i had to be in court. and then just all the police reports that i made. and i spoke to them constantly.\n\nover a period of two years, my performance suffered, and i received poor evaluations for what was described as poor decision making (lack of focus). on the evaluations they repeatedly indicated i was an outstanding officer with a good reputation, but my performance was suffering due to personal problems.\n\nseidle's chief knew.\n\npolice chief hunt took over in september 2014 from chief adams, who retired.\n\nin legal testimony, hunt said he became aware of seidle's issues before the shooting.\n\nhe didn't disclose in depth that he was having – it was kind of everyone knew he was having problems, hunt said. he was close to certain officers in the police department, but he didn't come to me and say hey, chief, i am having major league problems.\n\nhunt said in the deposition: just through our investigations into this and internal affair investigation is where we learned what the major problems were.\n\nhunt described three issues with seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a dwi case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and tamara.\n\nfor those issues, seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.\n\nthe prosecutor's report acknowledged the incident in which seidle argued with officers, and his suspension, but didn't mention the issue seidle had with evidence or the botched dwi case.\n\npunitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, seidle said. the punishments hindered his ability to pay child support, alimony and his own bills because suspensions cut his six-figure pay, he said. he said he leaned on capt. fisher for sympathy and, at one point, to pay the rent.\n\nhis department's reactions didn't address the real problem, he said from prison – stress related to his troubled access to his children.\n\n\n\nthe chief thought the answer was to punish me, seidle said. you know, if i forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that i was under stress and i was just having trouble coping. having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. and he knew that, he knew that.\n\nin one incident about 11 months before the shooting, seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the ocean grove boardwalk. he said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. he told the press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.\n\nthe teen's employer called police, according to the prosecutor's office report. police interviewed the children, who said they didn't want a relationship with seidle, according to the report.\n\nseidle said he was called into hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told seidle his daughter accused seidle of harassing her at her job. seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by tamara.\n\nseidle became frustrated.\n\ni'm tired of being intimidated and threatened by my wife every time we have a disagreement or something goes on between the kids, he recalled telling the chief.\n\nso, he said he was retiring.\n\ni gave him my badge and my gun and i told him: 'that's it, i'm going to resign because i'm just fed up,' seidle said.\n\nafterward, he said he talked to two colleagues, capt. fisher and sgt. j. hunter ellison. ellison also couldn't be reached for comment. fisher would later respond to the scene the day seidle shot tamara.\n\n…they all tried to convince me not to leave, they told me it wasn't a good idea, seidle said.\n\nseidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in august 2014.\n\nhe returned and the department gave him back his .40 glock.\n\ntrouble spread beyond neptune.\n\nin tinton falls one night in 2012, tamara admitted she had been drinking and followed seidle to the gym because she thought he was headed to see his mistress. seidle called the police, she left by the time they arrived and seidle declined to file a complaint.\n\nthe responding tinton falls officer contacted sgt. doug mcentegart. mcentegart spoke by phone with a neptune township lieutenant, a police report shows.\n\nhe informed me that there has been ongoing domestic incidents with the seidles, and after a brief discussion on that, i assured the lieutenant that a report for harassment would be written documenting the incident, mcentegart wrote.\n\nboth mcentegart and the neptune lieutenant notified higher-ranking officers. mcentegart also briefed an assistant monmouth county prosecutor. in an interview, first assistant prosecutor lori linskey said this was a police officer asking for legal advice, which doesn't mean a case was opened by the prosecutor's office.\n\nin asbury park the year before the shooting, seidle said he and tamara got into a custody dispute at our lady of mount carmel, a church and school where seidle would later confront tamara the day she died.\n\nthe argument prompted an asbury park police response, according to seidle. he provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. the city denied having access to the document.\n\nthe next day, seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by tamara.\n\nat least three times, the seidle drama reached as high as the monmouth county prosecutor's office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.\n\nin addition to being notified about the tinton falls incident, the prosecutor's office was notified of the 2012 argument at the seidle home in which tamara alleged past abuse and they signed off when seidle was later rearmed.\n\nthe prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which tamara reported to police that seidle was harassing her, then seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\ntheir report shows seidle wasn't disarmed after this incident. seidle told the press that his gun was taken away again around this time.\n\nneptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about seidle's problems and when they knew it.\n\nthe township denied the press access to the 682-page internal affairs report on seidle on the grounds that it was a confidential employee record. seidle's internal affairs history was not released in gramiccioni's report.\n\nthe press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.\n\nin a nov. 3 hearing, monmouth county assignment judge lisa p. thornton remarked on the number of internal affairs incidents.\n\nas a lay person, it seems to me like an excessive amount, she said.\n\nwhile his ia file remains secret, documents did emerge publicly showing two citizens complained in 2004 that seidle used excessive force during arrests, according to documents attached to a lawsuit alleging excessive force during a 2015 arrest. that lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge and seidle was cleared by his department in the 2015 incident.\n\none complaint in 2004 claims seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. the second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. the official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by neptune's denial of records. these complaints aren't mentioned in gramiccioni's report.\n\ni never, you know, was written up or had any incidents where i abused my authority or where i used excessive force against someone, seidle said generally about his discipline. i never was punished for anything like that.\n\n\n\na reporter sought official copies of documents provided by seidle and his half-brother, though many were denied by the government.\n\nin addition to denying the hundreds of pages of seidle's internal affairs history, neptune also denied access to 15 police reports naming seidle, including 11 which also name tamara, saying they are criminal investigatory reports. the purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of seidle's career. seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.\n\nseidle insists he didn't plan to kill his ex-wife.\n\nthe morning of june 16, 2015, seidle said he drove past the family's house. he had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on father's day.\n\nhe was supposed to pick up their youngest daughter at the family home on heritage court but she didn't come outside. tamara was already at work.\n\n\n\na congratulations banner was still over the door. the family threw a party the weekend before for two of the eldest children. they were the first in seidle's lineage to graduate from college.\n\nseidle, though, was suspicious of a car with georgia plates in the driveway. he jotted down the license plate number. he assumed it was her boyfriend.\n\nhe called tamara.\n\nwhose car is that in the driveway? he asked.\n\nnone of your business, he recalled tamara saying.\n\nit is my business. if this guy is living there, that's a problem, seidle said.\n\nhe said she wasn't supposed to have someone living there if he's paying alimony. and he was concerned about another man around their children.\n\nseidle's eldest daughter dropped his youngest daughter off at his home on walnut street in neptune. seidle deduced that a man had been spending time with tamara and the children. the kids had mentioned his last name before, his parents spent time with the kids. he was at the graduation party.\n\nthen all of this started just hitting me, seidle said. that was where the emotion started spiraling out of control.\n\n\n\nseidle left his home with his 7-year-old daughter and his gun belt. the off-duty 6-foot-4, 230-pound police sergeant was dressed in a peach polo shirt, navy shorts and brown sandals on the sunny day. he wore a bluetooth earpiece.\n\nhe called tamara as he was walking out of his home.\n\nis this guy living there? he asked.\n\nshe was busy and couldn't talk, seidle recalled.\n\nif he's living there, there's going to be a f------ problem, seidle said.\n\ni've got to go, tamara replied, he said. she told seidle that one of their children would have a father with or without you.\n\nseidle was shocked and hung up the phone.\n\ntamara told her boyfriend and her eldest daughter that seidle threatened to kill her, according to grand jury testimony seidle provided to the press.\n\n\n\nseidle said he drove up route 18 in his silver honda pilot, heading toward monmouth mall.\n\nhe spoke to his daughter, who confirmed tamara's boyfriend had been staying at the house for two weeks.\n\nseidle slid into an emotional tailspin because her boyfriend was being left alone with seidle's kids, taking over the role of the father, seidle said.\n\nseidle thought he would never get his kids back.\n\ni believed she was jeopardizing my children's safety, as well as my ability to repair my relationship with them, he wrote.\n\nhe said he called tamara several times.\n\nshe texted him back: what do you want.\n\nseidle cut off the highway at route 66 and drove to the church.\n\nshe didn't answer the phone, seidle said. i said 'ok, well if she won't answer the phone i'm gonna go to the job and i'll talk to her and get her to talk to me and see what's going on.'\n\nhe said he didn't expect to find her in the parking lot. when he saw her there, he thought they would talk, but she pulled away in her car.\n\neverything just went downhill from there, seidle said. i just blacked out. spiraled. my emotions were – i just got overloaded with the emotions.\n\nseidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.\n\njust emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. and i just broke down and just, i don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.\n\nhe chased her west on first avenue, south on central and west on asbury avenue, grand jury testimony shows. his car struck her car near jimmy's restaurant, knocking off the front license plate of seidle's suv.\n\nthree people lingered on their home porch on sewall avenue in asbury park. a worker ate a sandwich in his nearby car. an employee at a plumbing supply company down the street retrieved tools from a truck.\n\nresponding to a fender bender on the corner, asbury park patrol officer ahmed lawson followed the routine procedures, asking for driver's license, insurance and registration.\n\nthen a car horn, screeching tires. the two seidle cars tore around the corner of ridge avenue, nearly hitting lawson as he jumped out of the way.\n\n\n\nseidle's suv smashed into the rear of tamara's black sedan, ramming it into another parked car.\n\nonce he exited the vehicle, he began shooting, lawson told investigators.\n\n\n\nthe camera on lawson's patrol car recorded the sounds of the shooting. eight shots can be heard in the video in quick succession, then a ninth shot.\n\nlawson can be seen in video ducking behind his patrol car, away from seidle.\n\nprosecutor gramiccioni said lawson was too far away to effectively shoot seidle.\n\nlawson recognized him. he begged for seidle to drop his weapon.\n\nhey phil! drop that gun phil! lawson yelled before ducking back behind his patrol car.\n\nseidle's voice can be heard on the video.\n\nnow what!? seidle shouts.\n\nlawson gave the location over the radio, shouting for backup, noting that seidle had the gun to his head and that he was a sergeant from neptune. seidle's daughter ran to responding officers and asbury park police capt. marshawn love. love had been their neighbor for more than a decade and recognized the cars as belonging to the seidles. he drove seidle's daughter away from the scene.\n\nseidle fired another volley of four shots through the front window two minutes after the first.\n\nhe fired all but one round in the magazine of his glock.\n\nwith his left hand, seidle held the gun to his head. for about 45 minutes, officers held their fire, trying to coax seidle into surrendering. he shouted profanity, furious about being kept apart from his nine children.\n\nwith his right hand, he typed a text message to the children:\n\nyour mother is dead because of her actions…\n\ngoodbye forever.\n\nnearly 70 officers from four agencies surrounded seidle within minutes.\n\nofficers begged seidle to put the gun down, many calling to him by his first name.\n\na monmouth county prosecutor's detective, asbury park detective lt. david desane and another officer removed tamara from her car, the grand jury testimony shows.\n\nshe was pronounced dead minutes later at jersey shore university medical center.\n\nneptune capt. fisher pleaded with seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. fisher had worked with seidle for years. seidle said fisher had seen him cry.\n\nhim and i were very close over the years, seidle said. and i wanted to kill myself. but at that moment i just felt like i couldn't do it because him and i were very close and i didn't want to leave him with that memory.\n\nyou owe me that much, seidle recalled fisher saying at the scene.\n\nofficers told seidle if he dropped the gun he would get to see his kids.\n\ndesane left the scene to get seidle's kids, sending a photo of them to another detective who remained at the scene. that detective slid his phone to seidle.\n\nthey said they'd take his kids to a prosecutor's satellite office in asbury park. ten minutes later, they showed him another photo of the children.\n\nseidle lowered his gun. he placed it on the ground.\n\nseidle and fisher embraced.\n\nwhen it was all over, i just felt like falling out, like collapsing, seidle said. and i remember when he came, when he came into the street i just, i don't know, i fell into his arms.\n\nseidle was taken to the prosecutor's outpost in asbury park and escorted into a conference room, grand jury testimony shows.\n\nthe prosecutor's detective explained that he would let seidle speak to the children, but seidle couldn't mention what he did to their mother.\n\nseidle agreed.\n\nhe was placed in a chair and given a bottle of water. they led his children into the room in two groups.\n\nfor years, seidle had fought in court to get more time with his kids. the custody disputes with tamara derailed his career. the thought that another man was moving into their lives triggered a breakdown.\n\nseidle had wanted to be the father figure he never had.\n\nbut there he was, arrested on a murder charge the week of father's day.\n\nseidle and the children exchanged few words.\n\ni just told them that i love them and that i only wanted to have a relationship with them and that i was sorry, he said.\n\nthen he was led away to jail.\n\nthat was their last conversation.\n\nseidle was taken to the monmouth county jail a few miles away in freehold. his clothing, his photograph and his fingerprints were taken. it was a process the veteran cop had performed on detainees many times, but now seidle was on the other side. besides training at the police academy, he said that was the only day he had been in handcuffs.\n\nall of it was unbelievable, he said.\n\nas reality sank in for seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from sewall avenue, making headlines across the region.\n\nthe first thing he did in jail was to ask for a priest. seidle said he confessed his sin and asked for absolution.\n\nthe week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended tamara's catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. the children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing seidle and responding to the shooting. a notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. neptune, asbury park and monmouth county prosecutor's office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nthese days, seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. he is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to

seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, edward bertucio. he avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not

you to know i hate what i did. i am horrified and deeply saddened. it is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. i killed the woman who at one point i loved, and even though i hated what she did to me, i didn't hate her. i still cared for her as the person who i spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. although our marriage failed, there were many good times.\n\nseidle hopes

james s. robbins\n\nthe clear message to iran and other rogue states seeking nuclear weapons from north korea's claimed test of a hydrogen bomb is, go for it. no one is going to stop you.\n\non wednesday, pyongyang announced that it had successfully tested a hydrogen weapon which it called the h-bomb of justice. seismic sensors confirmed that some sort of event had happened, though the u.s. government has not confirmed that it was a hydrogen bomb test. if true, the test would demonstrate a deadly quantum leap in north korean nuclear technology and send a destabilizing message worldwide. in any case, another nuclear test of any sort is an affront to global order.\n\nfor decades, united states policy has been that a nuclear north korea is unacceptable. yet washington keeps on accepting it. prior to its first surprise nuclear test in 2006, the u.s. said it would not permit north korea to have a nuclear weapon. after the test, the policy became to not let the kim regime have any more nuclear weapons. and after subsequent tests in 2009 and 2013, the government played the same tape over and over. the white house says it is deeply concerned; the north koreans say, you should be.\n\nit is not as though the international community has done nothing, it has just done nothing effective. north korea has been placed under a barrage of strong economic sanctions related to its nuclear program in the last few decades. it has been the subject of numerous multinational talks and several important agreements. but these measures failed. one of the poorest, most technologically backward countries in the world now seems to have joined the most elite, most deadly club on the planet. north korea has proved that talk is cheap and sanctions are useless against a country determined to go nuclear.\n\nnorth korea has bedeviled more presidents than just obama: column\n\nthe rogue world is watching. iran in particular must be taking note of the international response to north korea's latest provocation. the two countries have allegedly cooperated on nuclear development. the al-kibar nuclear facility in syria that the israeli air force bombed in 2007 was purportedly funded by iran and built and maintained by north koreans. iran's nuclear mastermind mohsen fakhrizadeh-mahabadi was reported present for north korea's 2013 nuclear test.\n\ntehran is counting down to implementation day for the joint comprehensive plan of action, a.k.a. the iran nuclear deal, when tens of billions of frozen dollars will be released and sanctions will be lifted. there are no restrictions on how this money can be spent, and administration officials have admitted that it may be used to further destabilize a region in the grip of sectarian war. north korea's example shows iran that they might as well invest it all in banned nuclear programs and push ahead for the bomb.\n\namerica between a shiite and a sunni place: david andelman\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nthe obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to iran's deal-breaking behavior. in october iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 iran's president hassan rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous u.n. security council resolutions. none of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. however, the white house chose to delay punishing iran for these violations, though reuters reported that spokesman josh earnest said president obama would not stand in the way if u.s. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit u.s. national security. this frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells tehran that anything goes.\n\nhow president obama and other world leaders respond to the h-bomb of justice will send signals far beyond the korean peninsula. if history is any judge, there will be some angry statements and expressions of concern, followed by inactivity until north korea pushes the envelope again. and tehran knows that if it tests an atomic weapon, it will get away with it just like pyongyang.\n\njames s. robbins writes weekly for usa today and is the author of the real custer: from boy general to tragic hero.\n\nin addition to its own editorials, usa today publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our board of contributors. to read more columns like this, go to the opinion front page.
martin rogers\n\nusa today sports\n\nlos angeles – jurgen klinsmann's player selection policy for the united states national team is seriously flawed, unfair, and affects the squad's quality of play, according to major league soccer midfielder benny feilhaber.\n\nfeilhaber, who scored the winning goal for the usa in the 2007 concacaf gold cup final and now plays for sporting kansas city, has been frozen out by klinsmann despite feilhaber saying he is in the form of his life.\n\nthe 31-year-old insisted that he and several other players – many of them from mls – are not given an opportunity to prove their worth by klinsmann, no matter how well they perform at club level.\n\nalex morgan went on 'the bachelor' and tried to teach everyone to play soccer\n\ni don't know what that reason is, feilhaber told reporters on tuesday. i don't know if jurgen doesn't like these players, he doesn't like their attitude, he doesn't like their faces, he thinks they are ugly. i don't know.\n\nfeilhaber continued: if you ask me it can't possibly be based on on-field performances. there are plenty of guys in mls that have had better seasons than other guys, in mls or other countries, that are getting opportunities for the national team.\n\nklinsmann has been criticized in some quarters for relying heavily on naturalized players who grew up and developed their soccer talent overseas, such as germany-raised jermaine jones, fabian johnson and timmy chandler, and scandinavia-raised aron johansson and mix diskerud.\n\nhowever, feilhaber was adamant he has no problem with the head coach's policy regarding foreign imports, merely the way he says klinsmann rules out certain individuals regardless of their current form.\n\nmix diskerud responds to abby wambach's criticism of usmnt playing 'foreign guys'\n\ni've accepted the fact that jurgen's not going to call me, said feilhaber, who has made 41 appearances for the usa, played in the 2010 world cup, but has not figured since 2014. if i play the year that i played this last year, and i'm not getting a call, then i'm not going to get an opportunity under jurgen.\n\nin regards to how a coach should approach a team … there are two duties – one is making the best possible team that you can possibly make with the players that are available to you. and two, try to continuously improve that team so that team doesn't stall in any way and continues to improve.\n\nfor me, jurgen seems to try and do the second one without doing the first one. he would rather put young guys on the team that potentially could become somewhat important on the team and he leaves out players that could make the team better right now.\n\nthat's the number one job of a national team coach. not to make the team as good as he can make it in five years, to make it as good as he can make it now and continuously improve it. (in that way) he doesn't do his job. there are players in the player pool that do not get called in that have performed well enough on the field to get an opportunity.\n\nfeilhaber highlighted mls players such as midfielders sasha kljestan and dax mccarty of the new york red bulls, and defenders matt hedges of fc dallas and eric lichaj of nottingham forest in the english championship as examples of candidates whose form has not been rewarded by klinsmann.\n\nan example … i can see how dax can help the national team, feilhaber said. he plays in his position that in my opinion would help (usa captain) michael bradley become a better player.\n\ndax is a guy that can sit in that pocket and allow michael to operate in front of him and i think that he does it in a way that is better, or at least competes, with people who are tying to do the same thing on the national team right now.
paul singer\n\nusa today\n\nit was a line buried in an office of congressional ethics report that tipped me off to members of congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in turkey.\n\nunder the new rules house republicans approved late monday then abandoned tuesday, i never would have seen the report.\n\nthe 2015 oce report on a may 2013 trip to azerbaijan by 10 members of congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of house rules. but the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a turkish organization to provide free travel for capitol hill vips on trips to turkey. that allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated house rules.\n\nbut the house ethics committee didn't want this report released. the committee had ordered oce in march 2015 to drop its probe of the azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including rep. yvette clarke, d-n.y., who was a member of the ethics committee. but oce refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the ethics committee.\n\nunder the rules changes pushed by house republicans on monday night, oce would have had to stand down.\n\nread more:\n\nhouse republicans drop plan to gut ethics office\n\nhouse republicans move to slash powers of ethics watchdog\n\nhouse ethics board drives transparency, controversy\n\nit is not the first time oce has provided information to the public that the ethics committee could not or would not release. in 2010, then-congressman nathan deal, r-ga., resigned while the ethics committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. his resignation meant that the ethics committee lost jurisdiction over him, but oce decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. under the new rules, it would have lost that right.\n\nin fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about house ethics cases during the past seven years has come from oce reports. the rules as currently written require that once oce has referred a matter to ethics for further review — since oce has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the ethics committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. the most common action by ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. the new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the oce work would still be public.\n\nsince the oce was created in 2008, it has publicly released about 70 reports on investigations of members of congress and staff. by comparison, in 2007, before the oce was created, the ethics committee announced reviews of conduct of four members of congress. two cases involved lawmakers who were facing charges in court; the other two were for improper trips taken four years earlier.\n\non the senate side, with no similar independent ethics review body, the senate ethics committee has not publicly announced a single investigation against a senator in nearly 5 years.\n\nit is not clear exactly how the new proposed rules would have affected ethics investigations, but it is almost certain that the net result would have been that the public would learn less about allegations of ethics violations by their elected officials.\n\nthis is also not the first — and probably not the last — attempt by lawmakers to make it harder for oce to investigate them. two years ago, republicans pushed through a late-night amendment that underscored the need for oce to protect the due process rights of accused lawmakers. it is not clear that rules change had much impact.
aubrey cohen\n\nnerdwallet\n\nafter an accident, you might think it would be obvious what's wrong with your car and what repairs are necessary. but it turns out auto insurance companies and repair shops routinely disagree over repairs, and you should pay attention to such disputes.\n\nin many cases, insurance companies do not accept a body shop's estimate of what a repair will cost, industry officials said. in other cases, the insurer will generate the original estimate, and a repair shop might disagree.\n\nin either case, we work with shops to come to an agreed-upon price to repair the vehicle, says thomas hambrick, assistant vice president of media and public relations at insurance company the hartford. the hartford has applied for a patent on an automated system to review such estimates.\n\nmichael barry, vice president of media relations for the industry group insurance information institute, notes people can disagree on several variables, adding, in most cases these are resolved after an amicable negotiation.\n\nit's not in an insurance company's interest to put an unsafe car back on the road, barry says.\n\n11 states where drivers can save the most on car insurance\n\npoints of contention\n\nwhat do insurance companies and repair shops disagree about? here are the five most common sticking points, according to insurance and auto repair officials.\n\n• whether a part can be fixed or needs to be replaced. for instance, a garage's estimate might call for replacing a body panel, but an insurer might want the body shop to try repairing it first, says dan risley, president of the shop owners group automotive service association.\n\n• what kind of replacement part to use. sometimes an insurer will not pay for a part from the original manufacturer, insisting a used part or cheaper aftermarket version is good enough. some high-end insurance policies guarantee use of original manufacturer parts.\n\n• how long repairs should take. a repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, risley says. each extra hour is more labor cost. and each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.\n\n• the labor rate. a garage might have a per-hour cost that's more than an insurer is willing to pay.\n\n• whether there are errors in the estimate. an estimate might call for replacement of a part that isn't damaged or omit something that does need repair.\n\nwhere you fit in\n\ndisagreements tend to be resolved fairly quickly, barry says. it generally goes pretty smoothly, because the auto insurers and the auto body repair shops are going to be seeing one another again frequently, he notes.\n\nbut such situations are considerably more rare for the rest of us, who might also have opinions about how our cars should be fixed. your influence will depend on your insurance policy and state regulations. for instance, the contract might spell out what kind of parts can be used.\n\nmost states require repair shop estimates to identify where non-original parts would be used, and nine states require customer consent for use of aftermarket crash-repair parts, at least in certain cases, according to the insurance information institute.\n\nso find out what your preferred auto shop thinks needs to be done, ask if there's any disagreement from the insurance company and make your wishes known.\n\ni think the consumer has a vested interest in seeing that the process runs smoothly and that the car is returned to a state of good repair, barry says. it's a process that a consumer should watch closely.\n\nmore: the states where drivers can save the most on car insurance\n\nmore: how texting while driving can affect car insurance rates\n\nmore: nerdwallet tool: compare car insurance rates\n\naubrey cohen is a staff writer at nerdwallet, a personal finance website. email: acohen@nerdwallet.com.\n\nnerdwallet is a usa today content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the web. its content is produced independently of usa today.
tom nichols\n\nopinion columnist\n\nwhy can't this administration just tell the truth about the u.s. strike on iranian terror boss qasem soleimani?\n\nthe truth, after all, should be enough. soleimani helped organize and plan attacks that killed thousands, and he helped to turn entire regions of the middle east into a charnel house. he was an avowed enemy of the united states and its allies who was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of american and coalition troops.\n\nprevious administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with iran were too high. the trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him. this is a clear enough narrative that administration officials should be able to go out and tell it to congress, the american people and the international community without shooting themselves in the foot over and over.\n\nbut no. the truth is never enough for this administration. every moment must be a heroic thriller, an action movie starring dona­­­ld trump and seal team six. it is not enough to be a responsible steward of the nation's security, a role that requires patience and prudence, for which trump is unprepared and has failed repeatedly.\n\na hollywood script about attacks\n\ninstead, president trump must portray himself the way his base sees him, as a forceful avenger riding an american eagle into battle. he cannot bear to think of himself as jimmy carter, who agonized over risks and deliberated too long about the iranian hostage crisis of 1979, nor can he stand to think of himself as barack obama, the much more popular president he clearly envies, who created the terrible and defective iran nuclear deal.\n\nnow, inquisitive members of congress, nosy reporters, disloyal democrats and all the other people trump thinks of as his enemies have asked obvious questions about u.s. policy. rather than answer them, trump has sent his national security officials out with a hollywood script about an imminent attack that he says involved four u.s. embassies but refuses to explain to anyone, not even to his trusted surrogates at fox news.\n\nthe story began to unravel as soon as it hit the street. apparently, the threat was so severe that it was worth killing soleimani and courting war with a country of 80 million people. it's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any u.s. embassies that they were in peril. national security adviser robert o'brien dodged the question when it was asked. (republican members of congress might consider that such laxity was why they grilled then-secretary of state hillary clinton for 11 hours about benghazi, libya, in 2015.)\n\nworse, defense secretary mark esper has said that he saw no such evidence. making the rounds of the sunday shows, esper said only that the president believed the attacks were possible, and that therefore he believes the president. it is inconceivable such intelligence would have been kept from esper, and his admission that he has not seen any such thing raises justifiable suspicions that this exquisite intelligence does not exist.\n\nroll of the dice:trump crisis mismanagement on full display on iran, iraq, soleimani\n\nesper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. but again, it raises the baffling problem of why the trump team didn't just make the case that soleimani, like libyan leader moammar gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that u.s. forces finally had a clear shot at him. why lie when the truth is compelling? why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?\n\nthis is all reminiscent of trump's embroidering of the killing of the leader of the islamic state terrorist group, abu bakr al-baghdadi, an action that is to his credit and will be one of the few unarguably positive additions to this administration's foreign policy record. trump couldn't leave it at a stoic and confident proclamation that the united states killed a ghastly terrorist; instead, he had to pile on ridiculous details about al-baghdadi crying and pleading, things he could not have known and which remain unverified.\n\nsecurity for america or trump?\n\nwith both al-baghdadi and soleimani, as with so many other moments with this president, trump can't seem to stick to one coherent story. and so we end up talking not about policy, but whether there is something deeply wrong with the commander in chief and whether he can be trusted with american national security.\n\nthe more ominous problem here is that the trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. it might well be true that any day when soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. but trump — like bill clinton ordering an airstrike on iraq the day after the republican house accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.\n\n52 targets:trump threats to iran culture sites were illegal, bad strategy and a break with tradition\n\nby refusing to provide any details to anyone, and instead sending his briefers out to tell members of congress, in essence, to shut up, the president looks like he is trying to cover up a strike whose purpose had more to do with the security of donald trump than the security of the united states.\n\nin every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side. this deficit of character is bad enough in a single leader, but when it spreads to an entire administration, it is dangerous to national security and destructive to trust in democracy.\n\ntom nichols is a national security professor at the naval war college, a member of usa today's board of contributors and author of the death of expertise: the campaign against established knowledge and why it matters. the views expressed here are solely his own. follow him on twitter: @radiofreetom
andy slavitt\n\nopinion columnist\n\nthis new year brings brings fresh choices and fresh controversies in health care. president trump and republicans tried last year to repeal the affordable care act and, when that failed, to chip away at the law in other ways. but in the end, with no legislation passed, the principal result was to galvanize a once ambivalent public.\n\nnow we enter 2018 with health care as a top concern of american voters and the aca as popular as ever. more importantly, americans recognize the aca's flaws and by large margins just want them to be fixed.\n\nmore:tax bill is just another way to repeal health care. will coverage ever be safe?\n\nmore:republican tax law is not a win. take it from me, the backlash is coming.\n\nthere is plenty about the aca that isn't working as well as it could. seven years of no improvements and the peeling away of key elements will do that to any law.\n\nserious proposals from both sides should be listened to. republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. democrats want to address drug costs. but instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting medicaid and the aca to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.\n\nsubstantive policy debates won't be any more likely in an election year like this one. but in four critical areas there are decisions ahead that will have major ramifications for millions of americans — and potentially for what happens in november, when control of congress is at stake.\n\nmedicaid cuts: republicans failed in their attempts to cut health spending last year in various repeal bills, but that didn't stop them from going ahead with the sizable tax cuts the repeal was intended to fund. that created a $1 trillion-plus iou. now house speaker paul ryan wants to pay it off — arguing that with less revenue coming in, it's even more important to cut spending on medicaid and medicare.\n\nbut there's less appetite for deep medicaid cuts in the senate and even less in the electorate. if ryan is serious about reforming medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. i partnered with a republican from the first bush administration, gail wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. it would be a smart move now.\n\naca repeal: sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c. still burns a candle for repealing and replacing the aca. he and sen. bill cassidy, r-la., last year proposed a system of block grants to states, with fewer strings attached to the money and fewer protections for sicker or older people.it didn't have the support to pass then.should congress take it up again, it will be sure to aggravate a very active and alert public in an election year. perhaps more to the point, the republican majority in the senate is narrower than last year, and moderates and many conservatives aren't excited to live through the last year again.\n\naca fixes: if there's a way for trump and the republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the aca in 2017. the administration stopped paying cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.\n\nmore:it's now or never for paul ryan and his quest to remake america's safety net\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\ncongress should pass a permanent program allowing insurance companies to buy reinsurance to offset the risk of their most expensive cases. that would reverse some of that damage and decrease rates across the country, according to an analysis by oliver wyman. this would be a smart political move as these premium decreases would come out right before the election. you can imagine trump's tweets on how he's fixed things. no matter that he would be only partially fixing what he just broke.\n\ntrump's actions: with his executive order last year, trump signaled that he would undermine the aca's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. trump calculated that would bring the democrats to the table, but democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for medicaid beneficiaries. these decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.\n\nhow republicans decide to handle the children's health insurance program as part of the 2018 budget process this month will set a clear tone for the year. not renewing this program serving 9 million children was one of their biggest blunders of 2017. now they have a chance to pass a long-term renewal without any of last year's poison pills in the form of house proposals to cut medicare and aca coverage.\n\nthe action starts immediately and triggers a series of important choices. the overall path that helps the most americans is, as it usually is, also the path that makes the most political sense.\n\nandy slavitt, a

kim komando\n\nspecial for usa today\n\nq. i keep seeing posts on facebook about mark zuckerberg giving away money. is this true?\n\na. mark zuckerberg and his wife, priscilla chan, did announce after the birth of their daughter that they would be giving away 99% of their facebook shares. however, the couple said nothing as to when, or how, these shares would be handed out. this opened the door for online hoaxes, and there have been several going around. such as one that claims you could get $10 million just for sharing or liking, and another that has people posting a magical unicorn. if you see them, it's best not to click, like or share. you know what they say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nneighborhood safety\n\nq. my family is relocating to a new city. i'm unfamiliar with the area, and am concerned about crime. how can i see my new neighborhood?\n\na. the website my local crime is a great resource for anyone who is thinking of moving into a new neighborhood. it allows you to enter an address and see what crimes have been committed recently in the area. you also can listen to police scanners anywhere in the nation using free software called police radio scanner. keep in mind, every city will have its fair share of crime, but research will at least give you some insights into what's going on.\n\nwindows 10 privacy settings\n\nq. i've heard rumors that microsoft collects information about what i do online. is that true, and what can i do about it?\n\na. if you use windows 10, then the answer probably is yes. many consumers are worried about some of the details in the windows 10 privacy policy, which allows microsoft to collect a lot of information about you and your online activity. naturally, microsoft claims this information is used only to make improvements to their products' functionality, but this tactic still doesn't sit well with many. what's worse is that the steps to update your privacy settings are confusing and tedious.\n\nusing twitter for a small business\n\nq. i run a small business, and everyone says i need to set up a twitter account. is that really necessary?\n\na. social media has truly transformed the way customers interact with companies, and it can be a valuable marketing tool for any business. most companies benefit from having well-managed facebook and twitter accounts, but you need to know how to use them. posting too much or too little can hurt you. the best tip is to use each platform for a specific purpose that benefits your business. for example, use facebook to share events, photos and customer testimonials, then use twitter to share coupon codes, news and special discounts.\n\ncomputer security\n\nq. i received a new laptop for christmas. what should i do to make sure my browsing is secure?\n\na. one of the first things every new computer should have is a good anti-virus. but, beyond that, there is one critical computer setting that can really keep your computer more secure. it has to do with adobe flash. since flash is so widely used, it's also a prime target for hackers who are looking to hide malware. if flash can run ads and videos automatically, you may pick up a virus without intending to.\n\nslow internet\n\nq. i've noticed that sometimes my internet seems slower than other times. what causes this?\n\na. it could just be your internet connection acting up ... or someone could be stealing your line, sucking up valuable bandwidth. luckily, you can check to see what devices are connected to your network. and, if you do find unauthorized devices, there are steps you can take to ensure they won't return.\n\non the kim komando show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks. for her daily tips, free newsletters and more, visit her website at komando.com. email her at techcomments@usatoday.com.

anti-mask protests and videos of altercations over face mask requirements at businesses across the country continue to go viral even as coronavirus cases surge.\n\non saturday, burn the mask protesters blocked the entrance of a fresno, california, trader joe's, causing the grocer to close in the afternoon, the fresno bee reported.\n\nin los angeles county, where nearly 1 in 5 people are testing positive, a group of protestors stormed a ralphs grocery store sunday, argued with customers over masks with one protester calling a fellow shopper a mask nazi, according to the los angeles times.\n\nmeanwhile, outside a houston café, protesters waved american flags over the weekend after some customers were upset over having to wear face masks. houston mayor sylvester turner tweeted in response and support of the restaurant, saying he heard miller's cafe has pretty good burgers. i will patronize them monday and i hope you patronize them this week.\n\nnew starbucks menu:starbucks releases winter menu with new pistachio latte, honey almondmilk cold brew, red velvet loaf and more\n\na way to help meet new year's resolutions? chipotle launches cilantro-lime cauliflower rice, four new lifestyle bowls in time for new year's resolutions\n\nand at an h&m in hanover, maryland, on friday, a shopper recorded another shopper refusing to put on her mask and their disagreement. an employee also asked the unidentified shopper to wear a mask.\n\nyou don't care about people? you want people to die? people are dying of covid, said ronald harper in the video he recorded at the arundel mills mall store, wbal-tv 11 news, an nbc affiliate, reported.\n\nmask compliance has sparked debates throughout the pandemic after americans received mixed messages from authorities early on over whether they should wear face coverings in public places.\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention has said for months that wearing masks slows the spread of covid-19, but meanwhile, some politicians, including president donald trump, have been called out for not wearing one. as the nation edged further into the stay-at-home era, viral videos of conflicts over mask requirements at businesses have become common to see.\n\na flurry of videos started in late june as more stores started asking shoppers to adhere to mask policies. many of the viral disagreements have happened in cities and states already mandating masks.\n\noften, law enforcement is called to help, but the cdc has advised retailers to not argue with shoppers over masks.\n\ntrader joe's closed fresno store early\n\ntrader joe's has been asking shoppers to wear masks for months, and california started requiring masks or face coverings be worn inside businesses statewide back on june 18. several parts of the state required masks before then.\n\nin late june, a woman without a mask at another california trader joe's called employees and shoppers democratic pigs and screamed profanities because she said she felt threatened when a fellow customer cursed her out for not wearing a mask.\n\nregarding the incident at the fresno store, kenya friend-daniel, trader joe's national director of public relations, told usa today that safety and well-being of its staff and customers is, and always has been, our top priority.\n\nas such, since the pandemic was declared, trader joe's has prioritized creating a safe working and shopping environment every day, developing effective procedures that meet or exceed cdc guidelines, inclusive of mask requirements, friend-daniel said in a statement monday, adding the company will continue to do the right thing ... with all of our decisions focused on putting their health and safety first.\n\non its website, the grocer says it requires customers wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores. unless otherwise directed by local rule or law, this does not apply to young children and those with medical conditions who are not able to wear face coverings.\n\nhowever, for california, during current regional stay home order, trader joe's says all customers are required to wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores, without exceptions.\n\ndr. david abrams, professor of social and behavioral science at new york university, told usa today in october after trump got covid-19 that there should be consequences for not wearing masks when required like seat belt rules and needing a shirt and shoes to enter a business.\n\nretail stores have every right to say if you are not wearing a mask please leave, he said. this is a life-and-death issue. masks, physical distance and hand-washing are the three things we have to reduce the spread of the virus in the absence of a vaccine.\n\nmask wearing seen as a political issue\n\naround mid-july, the nation's largest retailers including walmart, kroger and target announced mask requirements would be implemented until further notice at all stores throughout the country.\n\nyet, even though signs are posted at store entrances, there isn't always compliance and there have been confrontations with maskless shoppers.\n\nboth the retail industry leaders association and national retail federation have encouraged mask policies to protect shoppers and employees.\n\nretailers are alarmed with the instances of hostility and violence front-line employees are experiencing by a vocal minority of customers who are under the misguided impression that wearing a mask is a violation of their civil liberties, brian dodge, the retail association's president, said in a july letter to the national governors association.\n\nrecent surveys show more consumers are complying with retailer and local mandates, but that it is often seen as a political issue.\n\nthe kaiser family foundation found in a recent poll that 87% of democrats and 55% of republicans say they are wearing a mask every time they leave the house and are around other people.\n\na recent ipsos poll had similar results with 74% of americans agreeing that masks are an effective tool to prevent the spread of covid-19 but that 90% of democrats agree with the statement versus 61% of republicans.\n\nmollyann brodie, executive director of the foundation's public opinion and survey research program, said the difference is part of partisan beliefs about whether masks are protective and necessary.\n\ni think that's what we are seeing in these continued protests is that belief that was set in stone very early on in the course of the pandemic, brodie said in an interview with usa today.\n\npresident-elect joe biden has said he plans to ask all americans to wear masks during the first 100 days of his administration.\n\nbiden said that where he has authority, he will issue an order mandating that masks be worn in places like federal buildings, airplanes, and interstate transportation like buses.\n\nbrodie thinks the results of biden's plan could be mixed.\n\nmany people will be happy to see that type of leadership on taking public health precautions and trying to help limit the spread and certainly the surge we're seeing in the coronavirus, brodie said. but some people and particularly those who are more likely to be republicans will react negatively to such a call.\n\nif you're planning to shop, know the answers to these faqs:\n\ncan stores and restaurants require masks?\n\nyes. local governments can decide what safety measures to impose on businesses, but individual businesses can institute further restrictions. many governors instituted or renewed orders requiring people to wear face coverings in public. most of the orders require people to wear masks in both indoor and outdoor public spaces where social distancing isn't possible, but some apply to only specific places or age groups.\n\nshould kids wear masks?\n\naccording to the cdc, cloth face coverings should not be worn by children younger than 2. older children can and should wear masks, experts say. schools across the nation are requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible.\n\nare people with disabilities required to wear masks?\n\naccording to the southeast ada center in atlanta, which provides training and guidance on access, if a person with a disability is not able to wear a face mask, state and local government agencies and private businesses must consider reasonable modifications to a face mask policy so that the person with the disability can participate in, or benefit from, the programs offered or goods and services that are provided.\n\nwhen should masks be worn and what kind?\n\nthe cdc recommends wearing masks in public settings around people who don't live in your household and when you can't stay 6 feet away from others to help stop the spread of covid-19 to others.\n\nthe agency's mask recommendations for types of face coverings include:\n\nwear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of covid-19.\n\nwear the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin\n\nmasks should be worn by people 2 years and older\n\nmasks should not be worn by children younger than 2, people who have trouble breathing, or people who cannot remove the mask without assistance\n\nthe cdc does not recommend the use of gaiters or face shields and says evaluation of these face covers is on-going but effectiveness is unknown at this time.\n\ncontributing: savannah behrmann, usa today\n\nfollow usa today

abu muhammad al-masri, the no. 2 leader of al-qaeda was killed in iran last summer, secretary of state mike pompeo confirmed on tuesday, though he did not say if the u.s. ordered his assassination or had a role in carrying it out.\n\ntoday, i can confirm for the first time his death on august 7th of last year, pompeo said in remarks at the national press club in washington, d.c.\n\nthe new york times reported in november that al-masri was gunned down in tehran by israeli agents at the behest of the united states. he was on the fbi's most wanted list for his role in the u.s. embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in 1998, which left more than 200 people deal, including 12 americans.\n\npompeo confirmed al-masri's death in a broader speech that cast iran as the new home base for al-qaeda – without offering direct new evidence.\n\niran is indeed the new afghanistan, as the key geographic hub for al-qaeda, pompeo said. they're partners in terrorism, partners in hate. this axis poses a grave threat to the security of nations and to the american homeland itself.\n\nhis provocative remarks come just days before president-elect joe biden takes office with promises to revive u.s.-iran diplomacy, including the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, aimed at curbing tehran's nuclear program, which the trump administration withdrew from in 2018.\n\npompeo, an iran hawk, has made it clear he opposes biden's plans to return to nuclear negotiations with iran. although he did not mention biden by name on tuesday, he denounced the appeasement of tehran as naive.\n\nlet's not lie to the american people about iranian moderation and pretend the appeasement will work, he said.\n\npompeo said iran's ministry of intelligence and security and other agencies have provided safe havens and logistical support, such as id cards and passports, that enable al-qaeda activity. as a result of this assistance, al-qaeda has centralized its leadership inside tehran, he said.\n\niran experts cast doubt on pompeo's allegations.\n\nit's just not believable at this point, said trita parsi, an iran expert and executive vice president of the quincy institute for responsible statecraft, a washington, d.c. think tank. this is an administration that is doing everything it can to create conflict inside of the u.s., and now it's doing everything it can to make sure that no diplomacy can take place between the u.s. and iran after it leaves.\n\nparsi said pompeo's claims amounted to complete nonsense and questioned why he waited until the waning days of the trump administration to announce such potentially explosive allegations.\n\nalireza miryousefi, an iranian diplomat attached to tehran's mission to the united nations in new york, described the state department's claims as preposterous, false and nothing new.\n\niran has long maintained that al-qaeda's chief backers in the middle east are countries with whom the u.s. has good relations, such as saudi arabia.\n\nmax abrahms, a terrorism expert and professor at northeastern university, noted that al-qaeda is first and foremost associated with saudi arabia, not iran. the trump administration has forged extremely close ties with the saudi kingdom and made isolating iran a cornerstone of its foreign policy agenda over the last four years.\n\nin a tweet after pompeo's speech, abrahms said it's true that iran has had some shady ties with al qaeda. we have know this for many, many years.\n\nbut, he added, if you're looking to iran rather than saudi arabia, turkey, qatar & pakistan to understand state sponsorship of al qaeda then you have been duped and lost the plot.\n\nbarbara slavin, director of the future of iran initiative at the atlantic council think tank in washington, also questioned pompeo's motives in making tuesday's speech.\n\nit's just more of an effort to justify a failed policy toward iran under the trump administration. what more mud can they possibly throw? slavin said. iran has had a relationship with al qaeda for a long time. if that relationship has gotten closer, then mike pompeo should just look in the mirror.
ap\n\ncolumbus, ohio (ap) — after winning their last two games in overtime, the columbus blue jackets went up by three goals in the third period sunday night against the new york rangers and appeared ready to hit cruise control.\n\nit wasn't going to be that easy, though.\n\nthe new york rangers scored two quick goals later in the third to turn a rout into a tight game down the stretch. it wasn't until nick foligno scored a wrap-around goal with 1:21 left that columbus had some breathing room on the way to 7-5 victory.\n\nfoligno scored twice and sergei bobrovsky returned from a team suspension to stop 22 shots for the blue jackets, who have won four of the last five and jumped pittsburgh to move into second place behind washington in the metropolitan division.\n\nit's a weird game when you're up 6-3 and they're pushing and pressing and get some flukey ones, foligno said. but we stuck with it and did the right things and found a way to get the job done. that's what you have to do — you don't care how it gets done, just get those two points.\n\ncam atkinson and artemi panarin each had a goal and an assist, ryan murray had two assists and nine other blue jackets picked up points in the offensive explosion. columbus had 19 shots in the first period and outshot the rangers 40-27 for the game.\n\nwe had the puck all night long, columbus coach john tortorella said.\n\nmats zuccarello had two goals, and ryan stome, chris kreider and jimmy vesey also scored for new york, which has lost six of the last seven and is languishing near the bottom of the metro.\n\nalexandar georgiev, spelling regular starter henrik lungqvist on the second night of a back-to-back, had 33 saves.\n\nrangers coach david quinn channeled the salty tortorella in his postgame comments, referring to his team's effort as a freakin' joke. the rangers, he said, lacked what he called a bit of a snarl.\n\n(columbus is) a team that competes hard on pucks and tests your mettle, and we failed miserably tonight, quinn said. miserably. our lack of determination on one-on-one battles, fishing for pucks. you do that in this league, that's what happens ... .\n\nanthony duclair, lukas sedlak and david savard also scored for the blue jackets. bobrovsky — who had been benched for thursday's game for violating a team policy and didn't play in saturday's overtime win over washington — wasn't terrific, but held off the rangers after they pulled the goalie for a sixth skater late in the game.\n\nthe team didn't release details of what happened with the two-time vezina trophy winner, but bobrovsky acknowledged he let his emotions run away him. he said he spoke to the team and cleared the air.\n\nwe'll move ahead, said bobrovsky, who hasn't been able to come to terms with the team on a contract extension and may be traded. i'll get back to work and do my thing, try to do my best to help this team win.\n\nnotes: columbus' 19 shots in the first were the most in a period for the team this season. ... blue jackets d zach werenski played in his 200th nhl game. he had the assist on atkinson's second-period goal. ... rick nash, who was the first star of the columbus franchise, did the ceremonial puck drop. the 34-year-old nash retired because of concussion issues after 15 seasons. ... new york d neal pionk returned after missing a game with a lower-body injury.\n\nup next\n\nnew york: hosts carolina on tuesday.\n\ncolumbus: hosts new jersey on tuesday.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nhl: https://apnews.com/nhl and https://twitter.com/ap_sports\n\n___\n\nfollow mitch stacy on twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy
jason margolis\n\npri's the world\n\nafter you collect your cans, bottles and paper, then put them out by the curb, do you ever think about where everything goes after the truck picks things up? largely, it goes to china.\n\nevery day, nearly 4,000 shipping containers full of recyclables leave u.s. ports bound for china. china sends the u.s. toys, clothes and electronics; in return, some of america's largest exports back are paper, plastic and aluminum.\n\nbut that equation is changing as of jan. 1 — china is enforcing its new national sword policy, which bans 24 types of solid waste, including various plastics and unsorted mixed papers, and sets a much tougher standard for contamination levels.\n\nchina notified the world trade organization about the ban in july, essentially saying the country would no longer act as the world's trash dump. currently, china consumes 55% of the world's scrap paper and is a major destination for other recyclables.\n\nthe national sword policy follows china's green fence, a 10-month policy the country enacted five years ago, which set initial standards for lower contamination levels for recycling.\n\nthe ban will undoubtedly hurt recycling operators in china that rely on the import of raw materials. but delivering a cleaner china is paramount for communist party politicians.\n\nthe national sword is also already being felt throughout the u.s. about a 45-minute drive west of boston in the city of westborough, massachusetts, bales of paper are stacking up in a parking lot.\n\nwe're looking at 150 to 200 tractor trailer loads of paper. it's stacked approximately 12 feet high, and it goes for quite a distance, says ben harvey, president of e.l. harvey & sons, a family-run business since 1911.\n\nto be clear: this situation is not normal.\n\nno, our business is to bring it in, process it and move it out as quickly as we can, says harvey.\n\nharvey can't sell the 2,000-pound bales to china because the contamination levels — the trash that's accidentally mixed in, something like the remnants of a greasy pizza box that gets thrown in with the recycling — almost certainly exceed china's rigorous new standards. if he had continued putting bales on ships a few weeks ago, they wouldn't have reached china until the ban would've already been in effect on jan. 1.\n\nharvey is hoping that china and the u.s. can work out a deal or he can find other processing mills in vietnam or thailand. selling the material in the u.s. simply isn't an option.\n\nbecause everything was going offshore, the mills have been slow to develop in the united states to handle this material, harvey says. with the tightness in the marketplace, there might be mills that will be built, but that takes four to five to six years to put in a mill that will handle the capacity that we're currently looking at.\n\nin the meantime, he's growing increasingly concerned as the bales of paper take over more and more of his parking lot.\n\nif this stuff doesn't move, and we don't know what to do with it, we can't keep it forever, he says. at some point, it's going to start to degrade. the other thing that could happen is that if we can't find outlets — and i'm not talking about just e.l. harvey & sons, i'm talking about the industry as a whole — we're going to stop bringing material into our facilities. and that's going to impact recycling programs throughout the country.\n\nin other words, trucks could stop collecting our curbside recycling.\n\nthis is not a little disruption, says susan collins, president of the container recycling institute, a research organization based in southern california. this is a big disruption to a bigger industry than most people would think it is, because it's sort of an invisible process. you put your stuff out at the curb, and it goes away — nobody thinks about it as being a multibillion industry in this country.\n\ncollins says china's crackdown presents something between a challenge and a crisis for u.s. recyclers.\n\nwe've already put things on ships that may be coming back, says collins. the u.s. recycling industry has asked for some relaxation of the rules, but there are ongoing negotiations right now in the hopes of making this not quite as drastic a move.\n\ncollins says u.s. recyclers are willing to adjust, but they need time.\n\nchina has already relaxed the rules in the past few months, shifting acceptable fiber contamination rates from 0.3% to 0.5%, still a near impossible standard for u.s. recyclers.\n\nben harvey says he can't come anywhere close to that. that's largely because american consumers are making it hard on recycling collectors.\n\ninside his plant, streams of cans, bottles and paper roll by on conveyor belts. a machine sorts things first, then workers do a second, manual sort — they pick out a lot of trash from the bottles and cans. about 15% of the recycling that e.l. harvey & sons collects in its recycling trucks is unusable rubbish.\n\nmore:trump's dangerous america first path: this is how empires crumble\n\nmore:china: u.s. should curb demand for opioids, not blame us\n\nmore:china hits back at trump tweet accusing it of selling oil to north korea\n\nwe call it 'wishful recycling,' harvey says. the general public says, 'hey, let's put it in (the) recycling barrel; they'll figure out something to do with it.'\n\nharvey says through sorting, he can get contamination levels down to between 1% and 2%, but no further, unless better machinery is developed and/or he can expand the line of workers doing manual sorting. but that's a risky proposition for a business that relies on thin margins and volatile commodity prices.\n\nharvey estimates that he can continue storing bales of paper in his parking lot for another three to six months. if a solution isn't found by then, it could mean shuttering the processing facility and layoffs, perhaps getting rid of 50 people.\n\nand that could also translate into more bottles, cans and paper being sent straight to the landfill.\n\nthis article was originally posted on pri.org. its content is created separately from usa today.
ap\n\nmoscow (ap) — a new generation of young, talented and, above all, clean russian athletes will compete at next month's pyeongchang olympics, according to deputy prime minister vitaly mutko.\n\nthe russians must compete under the olympic flag in south korea after the international olympic committee ruled the country operated a sophisticated doping and cover-up program when it hosted the 2014 sochi games.\n\nmutko — who was sports minister at the time — has been banned from the olympics for life along with 43 athletes, though he and all but one of the athletes have filed appeals.\n\nthose bans, which include 14 medalists, have helped clear the way for younger talent in russia, mutko said. while there would usually be about 40 percent changeover in the russian team between olympics, he said, this time 80 percent of athletes will not have competed in sochi.\n\nin practically every event it's an absolutely new, young team, mutko said in an interview saturday in a vip box at the european figure skating championships in moscow.\n\nalthough mutko is no longer sports minister, he is still in overall charge of sports policy and the government's preparations for soccer's world cup.\n\ndespite the olympic bans, russian officials expect about 200 athletes to compete in pyeongchang, though not all would have normally been the country's first choice. that's fewer than in sochi in 2014, but more than in vancouver in 2010.\n\nit's not yet clear which russians will go to the olympics — where they will compete as olympic athletes from russia because the country's team is formally banned. the ioc is vetting lists of athletes submitted by russian officials before issuing invitations.\n\nin every sport we have a lot of interesting young athletes with potential and we hope they can realize their potential, mutko said. we'd like them to compete in equal conditions. we're trying to abstract them from all these political scandals, though it's extremely difficult because we see the date on the calendar and it's not clear if (a particular athlete) is going to the olympics or not, because each of them needs to receive an invitation.\n\nmutko said russia's young stars who could break through in pyeongchang include 15-year-old european figure skating champion alina zagitova, ski jumper sofia tikhonova and speedskater pavel kulizhnikov.\n\nso far, the ioc says it has cut a preliminary list of 500 down to 389, but hasn't revealed names.\n\nit's likely that any decision will be followed by a rush of last-minute appeals by athletes who aren't invited, particularly because the ioc wants to exclude all russians with previous doping offenses — potentially including kulizhnikov — not just the 43 banned from sochi. mutko said that condition had been added absolutely illegally.\n\nhe said the court of arbitration for sport, which is hearing various russian appeals, was biased toward the olympic officials and the world anti-doping agency.\n\nit's basically tame for the ioc and wada. it's tame, he said, adding that russia still rejected the findings of ioc and wada investigations which detailed widespread doping. why does everyone tell us to accept the report? we won't accept any report.\n\nthe russian government insists it never supported dopers or covered up for them. mutko painted wada's star witness, former moscow and sochi laboratory director grigory rodchenkov, as untrustworthy and erratic, and said the russian government wasn't responsible for any malpractice in the state-funded sochi drug-testing lab during the olympics. instead, he laid the blame at the feet of the ioc and wada.\n\ni look at the ruling on myself and ... i don't understand it. i'm being accused of being a minister who did not ensure quality anti-doping at the olympics. but i wasn't supposed to do that. it's their work, understand? mutko said, blaming wada. they didn't control a damn thing — excuse me — and what, should we answer for that?\n\nahead of last month's ioc decision to force russians to compete under a neutral flag, some officials said that option would not be acceptable. however, no boycotts ... were ever considered, mutko said saturday.\n\nrussian athletes are appealing against certain conditions of eligibility, but no appeal has been filed by russia against the central point of the ioc sanctions, banning the russian team from competing with its own flag and anthem. mutko said that was because he believed the court of arbitration for sport would dismiss any appeal.\n\nmutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. however, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the russian football union and chairman of the organizing committee for the world cup.\n\nmutko said he continues to have a key role overseeing the government's multi-billion-dollar investments in world cup stadiums and infrastructure. leaving the organizing committee, he said, was simply not to give any extra reason for criticism of russia from abroad.\n\nin the government now, the president and prime minister, they've decided that i will continue to do all of this and finish this project, mutko said. so we're doing it and everything will be at a high organizational level. i'm absolutely sure.

the valdez main library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. for more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the on the streets program. those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. the program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. an average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. they receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. they get to shape the topics of discussion, too.\n\narkansas\n\nlittle rock: state officials announced monday that the closure of a hog farm near the buffalo river has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. arkansas parks, heritage and tourism secretary stacy hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of c&h hog farms inc. are complete. the shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last august, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. gov. asa hutchinson in june announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in vendor, about 95 miles northwest of little rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. the nature conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.\n\ncalifornia\n\nsan diego: a team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. a cataract was removed dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the san diego zoo safari park, the park announced monday. the gorilla, named leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from uc san diego health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. the operation was performed at the san diego zoo global's paul harter veterinary medical center. cataract surgeon chris heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.\n\ncolorado\n\ndenver: an initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the november ballot. the secretary of state's office said monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. the gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of u.s. states. it was eradicated in colorado in the 1940s. colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. the rocky mountain wolf action fund is campaigning for the plan. it says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. if passed, the initiative would direct the colorado parks and wildlife commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the continental divide before 2024.\n\nconnecticut\n\nwestport: gov. ned lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. the town hall-style meeting is planned for sunday at a school in westport, where the democratic governor is expected to be joined by transportation commissioner joseph giulietti. it will be hosted by state sen. will haskell and state rep. jonathan steinberg, both democrats. a transportation forum that originally was planned for tuesday evening in westport had been postponed. improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. that's why i'm so excited to host

throwing an incendiary device at a planned parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. samuel james gulick, of middletown, was charged monday in federal court. security video recorded gulick spray-painting the phrase deus vult, a latin expression meaning god wills it, in red letters across the newark building's exterior friday, the u.s. attorney's release said. gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. the object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. gulick was arrested by the fbi on saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.\n\ndistrict of columbia\n\nwashington: the viral art phenomenon known as infinity mirrors is returning to the hirshhorn museum on april 4. the

for which her paintings are known.\n\nflorida\n\ntallahassee: the state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former gov. rick scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. through the first week of december, the florida department of environmental protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. by comparison, in 2010 dep assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. dep holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. but the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.\n\ngeorgia\n\natlanta: the city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. i don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. i mean, how can we justify that? chief erika shields said at a news conference. two men were killed last month in atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. the chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, shields said. i have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said jack rinchich, president of the national association of chiefs of police in titusville, florida.\n\nhawaii\n\nhonolulu: road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. repair crews began working sunday on kamehameha highway in hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. an area north of pokiwai bridge will remain closed until further notice, the hawaii department of transportation said. ed sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. the collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.\n\nidaho\n\nboise: gov. brad little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. the 65-year-old republican governor delivered his second state of the state address to lawmakers monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. i am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, little declared. his budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. his budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. the state spends about half its budget on k-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. little's budget increases that by about 4%. in particular, little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.\n\nillinois\n\nchicago: several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. the legal sale of recreational cannabis began jan. 1 in illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. by comparison, michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. neal mcqueeney of midway dispensary in chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until friday. jason erkes said cresco labs shut its sunnyside shops in chicago, rockford and champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.\n\nindiana\n\nevansville: a recently retired university of southern indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. the indiana arts commission says matthew graham of evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. he succeeds adrian matejka, an indiana university professor. graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. graham is the author of four books of poetry, including the geography of home, released in 2018. he's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a pushcart prize, an academy of american poets award and two grants from the indiana arts commission. graham co-founded and co-directed the ropewalk writers' retreat in the historic southwestern indiana town of new harmony.\n\niowa\n\ndes moines: to keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, des moines international airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said monday. the extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. the airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. but because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.\n\nkansas\n\ntopeka: democratic gov. laura kelly proposed monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the republican-controlled legislature spiked last year. kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. the move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. but it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. the kansas public employee retirement system projects kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.\n\nkentucky\n\nlouisville: the kentucky humane society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. the humane society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. in total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. humane society spokeswoman andrea blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at purrfect day café, which opened in august 2018. the cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.\n\nlouisiana\n\nnew orleans: residents who had real christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. jefferson parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual christmas tree recycling program. it's the parish's 30th year doing the project. volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed feb. 1 to help move the trees out to goose bayou, according to seamus riley with the parish's coastal management department. the staging area is at cochiara's marina in lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. the parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect louisiana's coastline. the trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, the times-picayune/the new orleans advocate reports. in 2019, more than 6,000 christmas trees were collected in orleans parish and airlifted by the louisiana national guard into the bayou sauvage national wildlife refuge.\n\nmaine\n\naugusta: biologists with the state department of inland fisheries and wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. the study began in the winter of 2014 in western maine, and a second study area in northern maine was added in 2016. over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a gps collar. this year, the program will include a new area north of moosehead lake. the collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. for each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.\n\nmaryland\n\nannapolis: a newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. the capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. in contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. that process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. the newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. in the case of the man accused of opening fire in the annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.\n\nmassachusetts\n\nboston: the city council swore in the most diverse group in its history monday. the council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by mayor martin walsh during a ceremony at faneuil hall, the boston herald reports. the mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. voters in november also elected the council's first latina member, julian mejia, as well as district councilors ricardo arroyo, kenzie bok and liz breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. city councilor kim janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. the council was a white male bastion for decades, but boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.\n\nmichigan\n\nmidland: it's not what the egyptians had in mind, but it worked: a group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. it took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at bullock creek high school in midland county. they are hoping to be recognized by the guinness book of world records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. there was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, maxton herst told mlive.com. every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. it was just kind of mind-numbing work. herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on youtube. the students built the pyramid during holiday break. rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.\n\nminnesota\n\nwinona: an employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. a branch manager for fastenal in canada was fired just before new year's day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. ceo dan florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. news of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, florness told the star tribune. fastena'l, based in winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in north america.\n\nmississippi\n\njackson: prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. the southern poverty law center and other groups said they were sending the letter tuesday to the u.s. department of justice. the letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. u.s. rep bennie thompson, mississippi's only democrat in congress, called sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.\n\nmissouri\n\nst. louis: gov. mike parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. the st. louis post-dispatch reports that parson, the former polk county sheriff, said he is monitoring a platte county court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. the video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. but backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. the governor's stance is in contrast to the missouri state highway patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.\n\nmontana\n\ngreat falls: a native american tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. the little shell tribe of chippewa indians of montana has announced plans to host a celebration jan. 25 in great falls. the celebration comes about a month after president donald trump signed the national defense authorization act containing an amendment giving the little shell tribe federal recognition, officials said. the free celebration will be held at the holiday inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. the celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. the public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the shawn gilbert event center, tribal members said.\n\nnebraska\n\nlincoln: the city council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. the council voted unanimously monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. the new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. people have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities donna garden told the council last month. the ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.\n\nnevada\n\nreno: an australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. the center for biological diversity filed notice in u.s. district court in las vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with ioneer usa corp. the center filed an emergency petition with the u.s. fish and wildlife service in october to list tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. the lawsuit filed weeks later accused the bureau of land management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.\n\nnew hampshire\n\nmanchester: monks at a catholic college faced off in court monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. a judge heard motions in hillsborough superior court related to a lawsuit filed against the saint anselm college board last year. the unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. michael tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. the school was set up and run by benedictine monks for 130 years. the board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. it argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.\n\nnew jersey\n\ntrenton: the state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. the measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. the bill was approved by two assembly committees monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. to achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. at the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nnew mexico\n\nsanta fe: the legislature's lead budget-writing committee on tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of new mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. the legislative finance committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins july 1. another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.\n\nnew york\n\nnew york: the country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor monday. gov. andrew cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of penn station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. more than 600,000 people pass through penn station daily on trains run by amtrak, new jersey transit and the metropolitan transportation authority, operator of the long island rail road and the new york city subway system. the station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. the more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.\n\nnorth carolina\n\nwilmington: a popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. the starnews reports the n.c. department of transportation closed the southport-fort fisher ferry beginning monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. the department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early april. the work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in august and september. the ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. what was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. nearly 200,000 vehicles make the southport-fort fisher crossing each year, the starnews reports, citing state statistics.\n\nnorth dakota\n\nbismarck: a county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. the bismarck tribune reports the five-member burleigh county commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. the vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. that vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in burleigh county, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since president donald trump gave states and counties that power.\n\nohio\n\ncolumbus: gov. mike dewine has asked the state's medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. the governor's directive came after a recent report showed ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the columbus dispatch reports. dewine said he asked medicaid director maureen corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. the number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in december by the georgetown university center for children and families.\n\noklahoma\n\noklahoma city: two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said monday. investigators with the craig county district attorney's office and the oklahoma state bureau of investigation will be joined by the u.s. department of the interior's office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement for lauria bible and ashley freeman in and around the former town of picher, about 85 miles northeast of tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman michelle lowry. lowry said a request from republican u.s. sen. jim inhofe of oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. the osmre will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 army corps of engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving

says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the capitol press reports. water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern oregon where the climate is drier. every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the owyhee basin in southeastern oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. the lowest totals are in the hood, sandy and lower deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the willamette basin at 26%. the water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins

white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, botham jean, inside his own apartment. kemp said in an order that the interview, in which creuzot explained why he thought guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.\n\nutah\n\nsalt lake city: the state department of

during the winter months to be smaller than usual. a long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, jim hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the charleston gazette-mail. when the drought broke in october, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. but winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, hedrick said. the growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. the division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for january stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.\n\nwisconsin\n\nmadison: republicans

up of republicans and democrats met with state election officials in the capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the april 7 primary ballot. the republican committee members submitted only trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. the democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. the republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other gop

not where we're damaging anything so that all the media attention can go to look at what is happening over here. look at the facts and let's address the issues head on.\n\nstill, the nba and nbpa tried to address these issues already.\n\nthe nba and nbpa formed a social justice coalition consisting of players, coaches and owners to promote civic engagement and advocate for police and criminal justice reform. the nbpa also hoped teams could leverage relationships with local and state officials with passing legislation aimed at these issues.\n\ni'm sure and am very confident that (owner) marc lasry and the milwaukee bucks are doing their due diligence right now, especially with it happening in their own backyard, matthews said. i'm very confident in that. it really is just tough. it really is disheartening. but leaders have to be leaders. everybody has to take ownership in their own community. it can't just be those that have the platform. it's got to be everybody.\n\nthe bucks released a statement on tuesday, saying, the organization remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement. graveley defended the police officers' reaction, saying it was incontrovertible that blake was armed with a razor blade-type knife when he was shot seven times.\n\nreoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the black community must stop, the bucks' statement read. we will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist. as an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for african americans and all marginalized members of our community.\n\njames vowed to remain just as committed.\n\nmore than a vote partnered with the naacp legal defense fund to recruit 40,000 poll workers and helped register florida voters with felony records so long as they were unrelated to murder or sexual assault. it also oversaw voting turnout initiatives for the georgia runoff elections held on tuesday. and james added, we're not going to stop; we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow not only in my community, but all over the world.\n\nthe best thing we were able to do in the bubble is we were able to stand together in strength and numbers with everything that was going on in america and everything that was going wrong in america, james said. we were able to voice those opinions and voice those facts every single day. i hope to continue that now being outside the bubble.\n\nmathews said the lakers did not have a formal discussion about tuesday's ruling before their game. but after speaking for only 84 seconds about the lakers' win over the grizzlies, james spoke for seven minutes about various social justice causes. james plans to speak out more regardless of any backlash he receives and any frustrated feelings he has regarding tuesday's ruling.\n\nit's unfortunate we have some people out there that would rather see hate than love, james said. it's something we won't ever be able to change. that's how life is built unfortunately. but if we can get the majority on one side and on the side of love than hate, we can do some special things.\n\nfollow usa today nba writer mark medina on twitter, facebook and instagram.

as science, math and social studies in spanish for a few years before transitioning students to mainstream classes.\n\nmany use english as a second language instruction, a set of methods and

works for very young kids. but for a 10th grader coming into high school only speaking mandarin who needs to graduate in three years? there's no way that child has equitable access.\n\nin the late 1990s and early 2000s, a focus on english-only instruction became more pronounced as a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment led to ballot initiatives in several states that effectively outlawed teaching in multiple languages.\n\ncalifornia voters approved a ban on bilingual education in public schools in 1998. known as proposition 227, the policy barred many children of latino immigrants and latino

fatima hussein\n\nthe indianapolis star\n\nindianapolis — eight years into their relationship, john scott decided to add his girlfriend's name to the title of 10 acres he had long since inherited. but the indiana man had a condition: she couldn't cheat on him.\n\nand they put it in writing.\n\nabout two months after they signed the handwritten contract, his girlfriend, tina hemingway, became pregnant. by another man.\n\ntheir relationship was about to end. their court battle was about to begin.\n\nhemingway delivered the child in january 2013. she moved out in early june 2013, and that same month, scott sent hemingway written notice that she was in breach of the contract and must return her interest in the property to him, according to court documents.\n\ndonald sterling sues nba, which already has counter\n\nhemingway filed a suit to partition the property, and subsequently, scott filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\nscott, of madison, ind., won round one last year when jefferson circuit court judge darrell m. auxier ruled in his favor. hemingway filed an appeal in april.\n\nneither party responded to requests for comment.\n\nin her appeal, hemingway argued that the property deed itself extinguished the contract and that the contract was unenforceable based on public policy that prohibits contracts in consideration of meretricious sexual services.\n\nbut the three appellate court judges disagreed with hemingway that the agreement was based on a sexual contract and affirmed auxier's ruling.\n\nthis contract is akin to a prenuptial agreement, in which the parties resolve ahead of time their relative rights in property should the relationship dissolve, states the decision, authored by judge terry a. crone.\n\nblind ind. woman faces eviction after $43 land sale\n\neven so, we observe that the contract does not require either party to perform sexual services. nor does it require either party to abstain from all sexual activity, crone wrote. rather, it simply lists cheating by either party as one of the acts constituting breach.\n\nprenuptial contracts forbidding extramarital affairs are nothing new to the court system. however, depending on the locale, they can have varying results.\n\nin a 2002 case, diosdado v. diosdado, a california trial court found that an infidelity clause in a post-nuptial agreement was not enforceable because it was contrary to the public policy underlying california's no-fault divorce laws. however, in other states, infidelity laws reportedly are enforceable, provided the infidelity can be proven and the agreement does not violate state law.\n\nin this case, the judges concluded that the appellant was inarguably unfaithful. in crone's words, hemingway wasted little time in breaching the contract.\n\nfollow fatima hussein on twitter: @fatimathefatima
jason hall\n\nthe motley fool\n\nthe oldest baby boomers are now in retirement age, while the youngest are in their 50s. considering that many baby boomers don't have substantial retirement savings, social security is set to remain a critically important source of income for millions of that generation as they retire over the next couple of decades.\n\nhere's a closer look at three important facts that play a big role in how well social security will work for you and how much income you'll get. whether you're ready to retire soon or still a decade or more away, these three facts about social security will affect you.\n\nfull retirement age is set to change soon\n\nonce you turn 62, you become eligible for social security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at full retirement age. for anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. but for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase.\n\nstarting in 2020, anyone born in 1955 will reach full retirement age at 66 years, two months. for those born in 1956, they'll have to wait another two months, to 66 years, four months. this two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027.\n\nwhy does this matter for baby boomers? because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. for instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for social security at a reduced level. since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.\n\nbut someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. but if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. it may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nin other words, it's very important to know what your full retirement age is, no matter what age you plan to retire. a few months' difference could make thousands of dollars in difference in how much money you get.\n\nthis affects your spouse, too\n\nwhether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. in other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work – or at least delay filing for social security if they don't work – in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses.\n\nthis is particularly important to consider if your spouse will file on your work record, and is likely to outlive you. here's what the social security administration says about the survivor's benefit and how it could be lower if you retire before full retirement age.\n\nif your spouse started receiving retirement benefits before their full retirement age, we cannot pay you the full retirement age benefit amount from their record. the maximum survivors benefit is limited to what they would receive if they were still alive.\n\nin other words, before you decide to take social security early, you may want to consider how it would impact your surviving spouse's income if they are likely to outlive you and would receive the survivor's benefit.\n\nif you're likely to live very long or die very early, it may affect when you should take social security\n\nsocial security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. and while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.\n\nbut if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death:\n\nthis table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. and as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). on the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying social security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.\n\ntake a balanced approach and consider all the repercussions\n\nthe facts above are largely about the financial impact of when you take social security. and while the financial part should play a primary role in when you file, it's not the only thing that matters. we must each also consider what kind of retirement we want, the value of other retirement assets and what we want to do with the time we have before we die.\n\nand the more you understand about social security before you retire, the more time you'll have to plan and prepare. if you want to maximize the quality and quantity of your retirement years, start today – no matter how far from retirement you are.\n\ntry any of our foolish newsletter services free for 30

the editorial board\n\nusa today\n\nthere are some good reasons to turn down the california teachers who asked the supreme court on monday to let them stop paying union dues.\n\nfor one thing, the case is a thinly disguised attempt by conservatives to weaken public employee unions, which tend to overwhelmingly support democrats.\n\nfor another, deciding for the teachers would allow non-members to be free riders who could collect the wages and benefits the union negotiates without having to help pay the union's costs.\n\nand, finally, a ruling for the teachers would overturn an almost 40-year-old supreme court precedent that is the basis for collective bargaining agreements affecting millions of public employees around the country.\n\nall that said, though, the justices would do well to side with the non-union teachers, who have a first amendment right not to be compelled to support political speech they disagree with. that's at the core of the constitutional issue at stake here.\n\nsupreme court education case threatens local control: column\n\nthe case turns on whether unions can force non-members to pay an agency fee equal to the cost of representing them on purely work-related matters such as pay and working conditions.\n\npublic employees don't have to join a union, even if a majority of their colleagues vote to have it represent them. in california and other states, though, the law compels the union to represent everyone — members and non-members alike — in collective bargaining. and in california and some 20 other states, unions are allowed to collect some dues from non-members for that representation.\n\nthat arrangement was blessed by the court in 1977, when the justices said unions couldn't require non-members to pay to support a union's political activities, such as backing political candidates, but could be charged for their fair share of bargaining costs.\n\nthe teachers who brought the current case say that decision got it wrong, because there's no real distinction between a public employee union's political and non-political activities. when bargaining for taxpayer money, everything is political: paying teachers more means spending less on something else, which is a political decision. furthermore, the teachers bitterly resent having to support many of the unions' workplace priorities, such as making it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers with seniority.\n\nthe court's conservative justices embraced the everything-is-politics argument monday, and a majority seemed inclined to rule against the unions. chief justice john roberts said even minor matters such as working hours or mileage reimbursements are always a public policy issue, and justice antonin scalia agreed that the pay, benefits and conditions public employee unions negotiate are necessarily political questions.\n\nwill public employee unions wither away if the court rules they can't collect fees from non-members? the evidence strongly suggests not.\n\nthe nation's 25 right-to-work states already bar public employee unions from requiring membership or collecting agency fees, but those unions remain reasonably robust anyway. in fact, there's a compelling argument that taking away the right to force non-members to pay dues makes unions work harder to be responsive to prospective members.\n\nundoing the 1977 decision would be the correct call for individual rights, and it might just improve public education.\n\nusa today's editorial opinions are decided by its editorial board, separate from the news staff. most editorials are coupled with an opposing view — a unique usa today feature.\n\nto read more editorials, go to the opinion front page or sign up for the daily opinion e-mail newsletter.
from usa today network and wire reports\n\nalabama\n\nmontgomery: a judge on tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the alabama democratic party. montgomery circuit judge greg griffin scheduled the hearing for jan. 30. the hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. longtime state party leader nancy worley had filed the lawsuit to block state rep. chris england from taking control as party chair. a revamped governing board of the party elected england as chair this fall, but worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. the ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as worley and joe reed, against an upstart faction. the democratic national committee supports england and recognizes him as state chair. barry ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in worley's suit, said last month that england is functioning as party chair.\n\nalaska\n\nanchorage: alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in its u.s. climate report said alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. it also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. four of the last six years in alaska have been record warm years, noaa said. ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including anchorage, fairbanks, utqiagvik, kotzebue, king salmon, bethel, northway, mcgrath, kodiak and cold bay. alaska set the record despite a december that featured temperatures closer to average, noaa said. noaa's national centers for environmental information compiled the annual summary. among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. the contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.\n\narizona\n\nphoenix: the national weather service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in maricopa and pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the phoenix metro area in 1972. they said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either f0 or f1 in intensity. but in june 1972, an f2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in paradise valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in scottsdale and east phoenix. the national weather service in phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. tornadoes are considered a rare event because the phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.\n\narkansas\n\nfayetteville: the washington county jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. washington county sheriff tim helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. the sheriff told the northwest arkansas democrat-gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. the county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. on monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.\n\ncalifornia\n\ndana point: a baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the southern california coast. crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near salt creek beach in dana point on tuesday. capt. frank brennan aboard dana wharf's ocean adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. you could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. brennan told the orange county register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. the dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. the whales are migrating to the lagoons of baja, mexico.\n\ncolorado\n\ndenver: wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. the colorado parks and wildlife department announced the discoveries wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, the denver post reported. the news was first reported tuesday by the craig press. the hunters provided a video shot in october of two wolves shown near the wyoming and utah borders, officials said. it was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in colorado, officials said. the announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. the ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western colorado, officials said. state wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.\n\nconnecticut\n\nkillingly: the killingly board of education voted to bring back a controversial native american-themed athletic mascot. the board decided to reinstate the redmen mascot at a meeting wednesday, the norwich bulletin reported. in october, the same board approved the new red hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at killingly high school. several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. it featured the profile of a native american man wearing a headdress. newly elected republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. the board, with a republican majority, held a public meeting on dec. 11 where it voted to remove the red hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. more than a dozen people, including students and native american representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. they also sought some other compromise, the bulletin reported. at the wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray native americans in a negative stereotype.\n\ndelaware\n\nwilmington:a record number of vehicles crossed the delaware memorial bridge from new jersey into the first state last year. in 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the delaware river and bay authority. put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. that is twice the earth's circumference, with a road trip from delaware to myrtle beach, s.c. to spare. the bridge also had a record for a month in august, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the august 2003 record by 27,000. officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. all those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. for passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from new jersey into delaware.\n\ndistrict of columbia\n\nwashington:neighbors in a northeast d.c. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire sunday, wusa-tv reported. neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. james caviness-bey was working overnights at wal-mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their madison street home. but on wednesday night, he was able to thank d.c. firefighters for their quick response. he also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. with the flames intensifying, edwina caviness-bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. from there, she had no choice but to jump out. she had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. caviness-bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors wednesday night. even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. in the meantime, they have set up a gofundme page.\n\nflorida\n\nwest palm beach: doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. but alexzandria wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of mark and malakhi in march and kaylen and kaleb in december. oh, yes, i feel like i hit the twin lottery, wolliston told wptv. she said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. two months after the first set of twins arrived, wolliston said she learned about the second set. they were born in west palm beach on dec. 27. wolliston said kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on monday and she's hoping to bring kaylen home soon. she said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. i always say that i feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. i feel like they just sent them down for me.\n\ngeorgia\n\natlanta: leaders of the african methodist episcopal church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in atlanta. the financial boost for morris brown college was announced tuesday night, news outlets reported. in exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for ame church members. morris brown college lost its accreditation in 2002. interim president kevin james launched an effort last year to become accredited again. an official told the atlanta journal-constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. the georgia conference of the african methodist episcopal church founded morris brown college in 1881, the newspaper reported. the college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.\n\nhawaii\n\nhonolulu: improvements in programs to address hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. state homeless coordinator scott morishige informed lawmakers tuesday that new york now holds the top position, the honolulu star-advertiser reported. morishige presented the data to the hawaii homelessness summit for both houses of the state legislature. the summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. placements of homeless people into permanent housing in hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. the state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. after trending upward from 2013 to 2016, hawaii's official point in time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. the decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, morishige said. there has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.\n\nidaho\n\nkellogg:shoshone county sheriff mike gunderson told khq-tv that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located thursday by searchers in a helicopter. but that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on wednesday, gunderson said. he said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. the silver mountain resort said it received a telephone call wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. an avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. tuesday on wardner peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. the runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area tuesday with dogs and probes. the resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said wednesday afternoon that there were four people. another skier was discovered tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. yet another was found after dark. he was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. names of the victims have not been released. silver mountain resort is located about 60 miles east of spokane, washington, along interstate 90 in the idaho panhandle.\n\nillinois\n\nchicago: o'hare and midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. the cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in illinois. the boxes are located just past the airports' transportation security administration checkpoints, the chicago tribune reported. although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, chicago police department spokeswoman maggie huynh said. the boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. the boxes are owned by the department of aviation and serviced by the police. police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, huynh said. illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.\n\nindiana\n\nindianapolis:family members of hoosier bank robber john dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at crown hill cemetery. the lawsuit, filed in august by dillinger nephew michael c. thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by marion county superior court judge timothy oakes on dec. 4, but thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. that deadline would have been jan. 15. but on tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on thompson's behalf. it has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. it's unknown what thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. attempts to reach the thompson family and their attorney, andrea simmons, were unsuccessful. crown hill cemetery objected to plans to exhume dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. in a written statement sent to indystar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. dillinger, born in indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. his name became legend when fbi director j. edgar hoover labeled him public enemy no. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside chicago's biograph theater on july 22, 1934. rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in chicago and buried in crown hill cemetery. efforts allegedly made by dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. earlier this year, the fbi took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.\n\niowa\n\ndes

kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. the wichita animal action league said in a facebook post that the pit bull was found wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. he is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.the post described the dog as very sweet and loving. the group is asking for donations for his medical care. the post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. it will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. wichita officer charley davidson said an investigation is underway.\n\nkentucky\n\nlouisville:a billboard calling on senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to vote to remove president donald trump from office is making its rounds in louisville this week. trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes mcconnell's face. senator mcconnell, don't help him cover it up. vote to convict & remove. the mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: need to impeach, daily kos, moveon and public citizen. organizers said it will be parked along west broadway through saturday. it will make stops in front of mcconnell's office and also go to bishop lane in front of jefferson county republican headquarters. the four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. mcconnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions democrats oppose.\n\nlouisiana\n\nnew orleans: john white, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as louisiana's education superintendent. he told state board of elementary and secondary education members in a letter that he will leave the job march 11. he did not state his reasons. the board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. white can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. his tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and gov. john bel edwards. and the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of white. although he didn't discuss his future, the advocate reported in april that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, propel america, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. white has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state board of elementary and secondary education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.\n\nmaine\n\nportland: the state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. patrick keliher, commissioner of the maine department of marine resources, told maine public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. that would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. the season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but maine's lobstermen finished strong, keliher said. the price for maine lobster was also strong, he said. it's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. the biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.\n\nmaryland\n\nbaltimore: a 24-year-old chimpanzee at the maryland zoo has given birth to a girl. the zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on wednesday. the first-time mother, raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. the baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of baltimore in 2019. bunny, gave birth to lola in july. there are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the maryland zoo told the washington post. sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.\n\nmassachusetts\n\nwellesley: a college employee who posted a controversial facebook post about iran bombing the u.s. was suspended wednesday. babson college's director of sustainability, asheen phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on tuesday that suggested iran list 52 american cultural sites that iran could bomb, the boston herald reported. president donald trump posted on twitter on jan 4. that the u.s. has targeted 52 iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. in the now-deleted post, phansey wrote, in retaliation, ayatollah khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved american cultural heritage that he would bomb. um… mall of america? kardashian residence? in a statement wednesday, the former employee said, i regret my bad attempt at humor. as an american, born and raised, i was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient iranian churches and mosques. i am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. i am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.\n\nmichigan\n\njackson:a prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. u.s. district judge mark goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the detroit free press reported thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. munin kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. he said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a catholic priest. corrections department spokesman chris gautz declined to comment. kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. a teacher, laura bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.\n\nminnesota\n\nminneapolis:two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the minnesota constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. the proposal comes from alan page, a former minnesota supreme court justice, and neel kashkari, president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. they want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the star tribune reported wednesday. page and kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. even though minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. courts have interpreted the minnesota constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. page and kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. page and kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. to amend the minnesota constitution, they will need the legislature's approval to put the question to voters. the two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. but they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, education minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.\n\nmississippi\n\nhancock county: a huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a new orleans spacecraft factory on wednesday to a barge that will float it up the mississippi river for testing. the recently completed core stage of nasa's space launch system, which dwarfed the hundreds of nasa and boeing employees, was to be taken to the stennis space center in hancock county, about 50 miles northeast of new orleans. space launch system rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of nasa's artemis program. the core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant carnival float from the michoud assembly center in eastern new orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. it will undergo tests at stennis ahead of the first artemis launch, planned for 2021, said tony castilleja, a systems engineer with the boeing space team. the sls core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage nasa has assembled since the apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the moon. it will be used for artemis i, a test-flight without a crew. artemis ii is to send up a crewed spacecraft. the third mission, artemis iii, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to mars.\n\nmissouri\n\njefferson city: republican gov. mike parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by democratic challenger nicole galloway. those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. there are no limits on donations to pacs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. a pac backing parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers october through december. uniting missouri pac chairman john hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping parson in the gubernatorial race. a pro-galloway pac has not yet reported recent fundraising. the general election is nov. 3.\n\nmontana\n\nhelena: urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. the montana fish and wildlife commission recommended the city of helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, the helena independent record reported tuesday. former police chief troy mcgee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. the program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. the commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. this will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. the city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, police chief steve hagen said. the city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.\n\nnebraska\n\nomaha: despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the u.s. army corps of engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive missouri river flooding. the corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from gavins point dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. the corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. until a seasonal decrease that began in november, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. areas along the missouri river and its tributaries in parts of nebraska, kansas, iowa and missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. john remus, chief of the corps' missouri river management, told the omaha world-herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the national weather service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in january and february. the corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, remus told the associated press on wednesday. once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, remus said, limiting its capacity.\n\nnevada\n\nlas vegas:lincoln county authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. the lincoln county sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south nevada, officials said. authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. the herd was in the tule spring area about 30 miles north of mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, sheriff kerry lee said. the rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of december before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. the area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the lincoln county sheriff's office.\n\nnew hampshire\n\nnashua: three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an amazon warehouse, fire officials said thursday. firefighters in nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, deputy fire chief karl gerhard told wmur-tv. the major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, gerhard said. there was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. the building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. two were treated and released. a fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. osha and the state fire marshal's office were notified.\n\nnew jersey\n\ntrenton: all 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, trenton officials said thursday. the announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the delaware river and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of ewing, hamilton, hopewell and lawrence. pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and trenton water works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to david smith, the water works chief engineer. residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, democratic mayor reed gusciora said. that's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. about 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.\n\nnew mexico\n\nalbuquerque: the head of new mexico's largest catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. santa fe archbishop john wester cited the centers for disease control and prevention, saying new mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. he's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend mass. parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the our father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. he said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.\n\nnew york\n\nnew york city: nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, the new york times reported wednesday. the 298 cars on the a, c, j and z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. they were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. the metropolitan transportation authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. the new cars, known as r-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the canadian manufacturing giant bombardier. a bombardier spokeswoman told the times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, nanjing kangni mechanical & electrical of china. transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the times reported. an outside firm has been hired by the mta to inspect the troubled cars.\n\nnorth carolina\n\nchapel hill: the university of north carolina board of governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. dth media corp., which publishes the daily tar heel student newspaper on the unc-chapel hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the board of governors and the state chapter of the sons of confederate veterans, news outlets reported on wednesday. the deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. unc-chapel hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. superior court judge allen baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. baddour approved an agreement on nov. 27 in which the scv agreed to take ownership of the silent sam statue and build a center to preserve it. the statue stood for more than a century on the chapel hill campus before protesters took it down in august 2018. the university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. in addition, unc-chapel hill paid the scv about $75,000 not to display confederate flags or similar banners on any unc system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.\n\nnorth dakota\n\nwilliston: a proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the bakken oil patch. outrigger energy of denver wants to build a plant in williams county west of williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the bakken, according to ceo dave keanini. the company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern williams county and ends at the processing plant, according to the bismarck tribune. it has entered into an agreement with xto energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. the outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in north dakota. officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.\n\nohio\n\ncincinnati: the future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –planned parenthood southwest ohio region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. ohio health director amy acton recently rescinded that variance. to receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. the clinic in cincinnati informed the state in december it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. the clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. it indicated it was seeking another physician. kersha deibel, president and chief executive officer of the planned parenthood region, told the columbus dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.\n\noklahoma\n\noklahoma city: the oklahoma corporation commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including oklahoma county and oklahoma city. the commission said the north american numbering plan administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in july. starting in january 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. commission spokesman matt skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. the area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes tulsa. the commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in december 2021.\n\noregon\n\nportland: lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. the city commission unanimously voted to give the contract to rapid response bio clean on wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, oregon public broadcasting reported thursday. opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. under a modified deal, rapid response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. the workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. the city has contracted with rapid response since 2016. but in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. mayor ted wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. rapid response was to resume its work by thursday.\n\npennsylvania\n\nmacungie: mack trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of philadelphia, the company said wednesday. mack blamed the layoffs at its lower macungue township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. they will take effect at the end of february, the (allentown) morning call reported. the cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. we regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said mack spokesman christopher heffner. employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news wednesday. the cuts were expected after mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. mack expects the north american truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.\n\nrhode island\n\nprovidence: legislative leaders said wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. a provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. democratic gov. gina raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. democratic house speaker nicholas mattiello and senate president dominick ruggerio said wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. however, they still took issue with how the department of business regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. the legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.\n\nsouth carolina\n\ncolumbia: gov. henry mcmaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. the program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. mcmaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4k program to the remaining 17 districts. several are among south carolina's largest districts, including beaufort, charleston, greenville and richland district 2, according to the post and courier of charleston. mcmaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4k program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in south carolina. several senators and house members praised the republican governor's proposal. democratic sen. vincent sheheen of camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.\n\nsouth dakota\n\nsioux falls:police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off

decision resolves a dispute between gm in spring hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, chairman mike herron told the daily herald on thursday. under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in october, gm agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. none of the temporary workers in spring hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. the deal between gm and local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. the company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. on monday, gm announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 uaw-represented plants across the country. ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. at gm's flint assembly in michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.\n\ntexas\n\ngalveston: remains found on a tiny south pacific island where a bloody world war ii battle happened have been identified as those of a missing marine from galveston, a federal agency said wednesday. in a statement, the defense pow/mia accounting agency announced that the remains of 1st lt. justin g. mills of galveston, texas, had been identified. the remains were found in 2015 on the island of betio in the tarawa atoll of the gilbert islands. the remains were turned over to the dpaa laboratory for genetic identification. mills had been missing since the november 1943 battle for tarawa, which left about 1,000 u.s. marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. the dpaa said mills died on the battle's first day. mills is to be buried april 29 at arlington national cemetery in virginia.\n\nutah\n\nst. george: more than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern utah, federal officials said. the proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. the bureau of land management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, the spectrum newspaper reported wednesday. blm is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, venhuizen said. details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. the draft is the first step in the year-long national environmental policy act, officials said. the utah division of transportation and washington county proposed building the northern corridor that would pass through the red cliffs national conservation area, officials said. a definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. after the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. a decision is expected by 2021.\n\nvermont\n\nmontpelier: the number of fatalities on vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. vermont state police and the vermont agency of transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the times argus reported. but state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. lt. tara thomas, commander of safety programs for the vermont state police, said the reduction was unexplainable. thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. we wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. that's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. we're averaging just way too many each month, she said. the 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. the figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.\n\nvirginia\n\nvirginia beach: an animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. the woman and the felines were found living in a virginia beach self-storage unit this week, the city's animal care and adoption center said on tuesday. the city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, animal control supervisor meghan conti told the virginian-pilot. the adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. they're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. the animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.\n\nwashington\n\nseattle: mayor jenny durkan said seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. durkan included those directives in a green new deal executive order wednesday. neither the new keyarena now under construction at seattle center nor the massive seattle aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, durkan said. that's because the projects are underway, she said. both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. the $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, durkan's office said. there's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. last year, the council passed a green new deal resolution that said seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.\n\nwest virginia\n\ncharleston: the u.s. labor department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in west virginia, the state's u.s. senators announced. the funding is through the disaster recovery national dislocated worker grant program. flooding in february 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents

electrician apprentice from chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. i only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, mecher said. i put it on the roof in lemont, illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to bessemer, michigan. snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. there's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. but mecher purchased the 1990 polaris indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in bessemer last friday. mecher said it took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 chevy malibu, using an old blue ford tractor with a bucket. he modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. he secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors. mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. when he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. when he arrived in bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.\n\nwyoming\n\njackson: foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in grand teton national park. park officials closed a large area of the teton range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. grand teton spokeswoman denise germann said another attempt could take place in late january or early february. mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. the national park service has contracted oregon-based baker aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the jackson hole news & guide reported. wintry weather kept baker from making it to the area, germann said. park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
ap\n\npittsburgh (ap) — the father in mike tomlin regrets the language he used to describe the new england patriots during the postgame speech pittsburgh steelers wide receiver antonio brown opted to livestream on social media after a taut playoff victory over kansas city.\n\nthe coach in tomlin has just as big an issue with one of his team's biggest stars forcing the steelers to talk about something other than trying to find a way to finally beat tom brady when it counts.\n\na characteristically blunt tomlin called brown's decision to broadcast to the world more than 17 minutes of pittsburgh's giddy locker room celebration — a move that caught tomlin using a handful of profanities — foolish, ''selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nnot only is it a violation of our policy, it's a violation of league policy, both of which he knows, tomlin said tuesday.\n\nso there are consequences to be dealt with from his perspective. we will punish him. we won't punish us.\n\ntomlin took responsibility for his choice of words, though he was unaware of being filmed as he spoke.\n\nduring tomlin's post-game remarks, he attached an expletive to the patriots, who earned a full day's head start on preparing for the steelers by virtue of beating houston on saturday night, 24 hours before pittsburgh outlasted kansas city 18-16.\n\nthe responsibility associated with being in this thing, just from a role model standpoint, it's something that i personally embrace, tomlin said.\n\nit's something that we as a team and organization embrace. so that's why the language, specifically, in terms of the content, is regrettable.\n\nso, too, is the action of the talented if sporadically diva-like brown. the former sixth-round pick has evolved from a raw project into one of the nfl's best wide receivers.\n\nthis season he became only the second player in league history to post four consecutive 100-catch seasons.\n\nhis work ethic is universally lauded even as his q-rating has skyrocketed. brown can be found on tv pitching everything from soda to credit cards to video games.\n\nthe player who — for reasons he hasn't yet disclosed — occasionally refers to himself as ronald  also has a devoted social media presence, with more than 1.5 million following on instagram and an additional 650,000 on facebook, many of whom got an eyeful and an earful as the steelers celebrated their first trip to the afc title game in six years.\n\nwhile tomlin has very little concern about the content of the video, he has plenty of concern over brown's lack of judgment.\n\nyou wear on your teammates when they routinely have to answer questions about things that aren't preparation or football-related, tomlin said.\n\nit's our desire for him and for everyone to be great teammates, as well as great players. he is a great player. he is a hardworking player. he is respected, largely, in the locker room for those things. but incidences such as this don't help him in that regard.\n\nthe steelers have grown accustomed to brown's flights of fancy, whether it's posing for the mannequin challenge while meeting with reporters, wearing eye-opening (and fine threatening) cleats or doing over-the-top touchdown celebrations.\n\nthe fallout this time around has been mixed. long snapper greg warren said monday that ab is ab, he can do what he wants to do.\n\nben roethlisberger expressed disappointment in brown during the quarterback's weekly appearance on 93.7 the fan.\n\neither way, the fact that both were forced to respond to questions about brown before the biggest game of the season only reinforces tomlin's point, though tomlin stressed that brown is hardly the only athlete capable of becoming a distraction.\n\nthose things don't apply exclusively to antonio, tomlin said. it's a global thing in regards to professional sports. i think that's why often times you see great players move around from team to team.\n\nand i definitely don't want that to be his story. i am sure he doesn't want that to be his story. so, he has to address these things that put him and us in positions from time to time, in settings such as this, where it needs to be addressed.\n\ntomlin didn't outline the internal discipline brown faces other than to say it will not affect his availability this weekend.\n\nnew england (15-2) pulled away from the steelers (13-5) in the second half of a 27-16 victory in pittsburgh on oct. 23, a game roethlisberger missed while recovering from surgery on his left knee.\n\nroethlisberger will be around this time. and so will brown, who will almost certainly have his phone's camera turned off late sunday evening regardless of the outcome.\n\nhe has to grow from this, tomlin said. he has to.\n\nnotes: lb james harrison is dealing with shoulder

cincinnati – an ohio taco bell employee declined to take the order of a man who is deaf. the employee no longer works at the establishment, the company said in a statement.\n\nthe patron, sitting in a vehicle at a drive-thru window, appears to attempt to communicate with the employee by writing messages on his phone, according to video of the exchange shared wednesday by the man's mother in a public facebook post.\n\nthe woman, identified as becky burch, wrote that the incident occurred at a taco bell in kettering, ohio, near dayton.\n\nthis is my deaf son getting discriminated against in the taco bell drive thru, the woman wrote. he was trying to show them his order and they told him it was against company policy to take his order that way. really??\n\nthe employee also tells the man he will call 911 if you don't move, according to the video.\n\ntaco bell released the following statement about the incident on thursday:\n\ntaco bell has a fundamental policy to respect all of our customers and employees, and we are committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or harassment. the franchise owner and operator of this location has investigated this situation and the team member no longer works for their organization. all team members at this restaurant are being retrained by the franchise owner on their policies.\n\nmore:january specials: your monthly guide to freebies and meal deals
on wednesday, president donald trump encouraged his supporters to never accept defeat, then watched as hundreds of them stormed the u.s. capitol and rampaged through the halls of congress, later saying, we love you, you're very special to those involved in the deadly and appalling attack.\n\non thursday, hall of fame golfers annika sorenstam and gary player stood with trump at the white house to accept the presidential medal of freedom. they likely were the first outsiders to be with trump at the white house since the reprehensible violence just 16 blocks away.\n\nsorenstam and player, widely regarded as paragons of sportsmanship and honor in their game, did not cancel on trump. they did not note the horror that had taken place on his watch and decide that thursday wasn't an appropriate time to celebrate with him at the white house. they did not care about the gravity of the situation, about the calls from political leaders to remove trump by impeachment or the 25th amendment.\n\nno. they willingly chose to accept an award from trump and be seen with him a day after his words and actions launched one of the most shameful incidents in u.s. history.\n\nthere will be those who say sorenstam, who was born in sweden, and player, from south africa, can choose to accept an award from trump whenever they wish. that is true. what's more, sorenstam was an ardent supporter of trump's failed re-election bid, retweeting jack nicklaus' multi-paragraph endorsement of trump in the days before the 2020 election.\n\nbut sorenstam and player don't just represent themselves. they represent all of golf, a mostly lily-white sport that has struggled for decades, to its continuing detriment, to attract women and people of color – just as trump, a creature of the game, has denigrated those very same people.\n\nopinion: nba stars jaylen brown, jimmy butler have seen two different americas. they hope now everybody sees it.\n\nson knows best: gary player's son thinks father should decline presidential medal of freedom\n\nas representatives of their game, and as business people who benefit greatly from it, their reputations are sullied, forever. sorenstam and player now will be attached to trump at this horrible time in our nation's history, forever. they will be known as the people who had the chance to gracefully suggest another day might be better to celebrate golfers in this nation – golfers, for heaven's sake – and they refused to do so.\n\nthey had nothing to do with the insurrection of the trump mob on wednesday, of course, but they happily became trump's thursday accessories. they celebrated with him as our nation mourns what he has wrought.\n\na third golfer, the late babe didrikson zaharias, also was honored by trump. this is just a guess, but it's hard to believe the strong, legendary, groundbreaking babe would have allowed herself to have anything to do with that awful man.\n\nwhile player, 85, who once supported his nation's racist policy of apartheid before later denouncing it, is an understandable trump ally, sorenstam's involvement with trump is perplexing. she is one of the greatest women to ever play the game. now 50, sorenstam is known as a trailblazer for playing in a men's pga tour event, the colonial, in 2003, enduring sexist taunts from a couple of male players while drawing huge crowds and acquitting herself quite well before missing the cut.\n\nwhen she retweeted nicklaus' endorsement of trump, i texted her a question:\n\nhow do you reconcile trump's awful record on women – bragging and joking about sexually assaulting women (access hollywood tape), calling the democratic vp nominee a 'monster,' being accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment by at least 26 women, etc. – while being a woman who has forged an amazing career around the issues of inclusion for women and treating women equally and fairly and with respect?\n\nshe never replied. on thursday afternoon, i texted again, this time to say i'd like to talk to her about accepting the medal of freedom a day after the awful rampage of trump supporters at the capitol. she did not reply.\n\nit turns out that the ceremony for sorenstam and player was not open to the press. there were no photos immediately available. the event was basically held in secret.\n\nactually, it was held in shame.
davos, switzerland — french president emmanuel macron told a crowd of internationalists that globalization is in a major crisis at the world economic forum wednesday.\n\nhe kicked off his address with a joke related to climate change at the expense of president trump, who arrives in this alpine resort thursday morning.\n\nwhen you arrive here and see the snow, it could be hard to believe in global warming, macron said to a packed audience of business leaders and politicians. obviously you don't invite anyone skeptical about global warming this year. trump has commented in the past that he thinks global warming is a hoax.\n\nthe white house confirmed wednesday that macron would be the guest of honor at trump's first state dinner at the white house. no date was announced.\n\nmacron also said a stronger europe was needed to avoid problems with people who feel they've been forgotten and left behind.\n\nhe called on world leaders to act in a multilateral way when confronting challenges from nations including north korea and iran, and when fighting extremist groups to avoid fracturing of the region. trump's administration has threatened to withdraw from an international accord with iran that freezes its nuclear weapons program.\n\nwe've got not only to win the war against terrorism but we've got to create conditions for durable peace, macron said, adding that a multilateral political and diplomatic approach would help in the middle east.\n\ngerman chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister paolo gentiloni echoed macron's sentiments tuesday, calling for a stronger europe, and for a rejection of trump's america first economic and trade policy.\n\nmore:davos: europe readies riposte to trump's 'america first'\n\nmore:davos 2018: why do 3,000 of the world's most powerful people flock to a swiss town?\n\nmore:treasury secretary mnuchin to global elites: trump's 'america first' is not america alone\n\nmore:how men can teach men not to be sexual harassers\n\nwe cannot end up in a world with a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of discontented workers, gentiloni said. our history and roots are not synonymous with protectionism.\n\nmerkel said that germany is a country committed to finding multilateral solutions. let us not shut ourselves off from the world, she said.\n\nmacron said the world is hitting roadblocks in several major areas.\n\nin terms of trade, we are moving back again towards greater protectionism, greater fragmentation and we are undoing what globalization has been able to achieve, macron said. in terms of climate change, we are losing the battle. how are we going to explain to people that they are going to be more vulnerable?\n\ncontributing: gregory korte in washington, d.c.
wendy r. sherman\n\nopinion columnist\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. he was forced to postpone his trip to kyiv, ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in iraq. as fraught as pompeo's visit to kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, iraq trumped kyiv after the new year's eve attack on the u.s. embassy in baghdad.\n\nit is president donald trump's failed policy toward iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\n\niraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 u.s. invasion that upended the middle east and cost so much in u.s. lives and treasure. but iraq also created strange bedfellows. the u.s. troops worked alongside iraqi and iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the islamic state terrorism group. and even as washington was confronting iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in iraq, where tehran holds considerable sway.\n\nthat uneasy balance was destroyed when trump withdrew from the joint comprehensive plan of action, better known as the iran nuclear deal. like other critics of the agreement, trump believed it should have resolved all of america's issues with iran. trump believed we were giving tehran benefits without a requisite return. he thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\n\ntrump policies devastate us interests\n\nlike much of trump's national security and foreign policy, his iran approach is tactical and not strategic. the results have been devastating to u.s. interests. iran's most extreme hard-liners, the iranian revolutionary guards corps (irgc) and quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the united states couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\n\niran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. indeed, the irgc has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under trump's sanctions. and iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\n\nlearning to manage conflict:as iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\n\nin iraq, iranian-backed militia, led by kataeb hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. a rocket attack by the kataeb hezbollah militia last friday killed an american contractor and injured many. the trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the new year's eve attack on our embassy.\n\nmost would agree that the united states had to respond in some way to the death of an american, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\n\nregardless, if the trump administration really understood the dynamics of iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the u.s. embassy. administration officials might have worked more closely with the iraq government to think through the best way forward. instead, in essence, trump walked into iran's trap.\n\nfor many americans, the baghdad militia chants of death to america echoed the takeover of the u.s. embassy in tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\n\niran nuclear deal was solid progress\n\nthe immediate emergency at our embassy in baghdad has subsided. kataeb hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to america. they want the 5,000 u.s. troops out of iraq.\n\nnonetheless, perhaps even pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\n\ntrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw american troops from just about everywhere. but a withdrawal from iraq at this moment only serves iran's desire to exert greater control over iraq. to much of the world, it would signal u.s. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\n\neven some of the harshest critics of the iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. the iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. such a capability would project even greater iranian power in the middle east and deter the ability of washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\n\ndiplomatic amateur hour:sondland's impeachment testimony proves trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\n\nconcerted action to curtail iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. had trump stayed in the iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the u.s. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\n\nthree years into his presidency, donald trump owns the events and outcomes in iraq and iran, as he does in north korea, afghanistan, venezuela, the middle east, russia, china and hong kong. having diminished our state department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\n\nthe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of state's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\n\nwendy r. sherman, a professor and the director of the center for public leadership at harvard kennedy school, was undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2011-15 and led u.s. negotiations on the iran nuclear deal. she is a member of usa today's board of contributors and the author of not for the faint of heart: lessons in courage, power and persistence. follow her on twitter: @wendyrsherman
continuing the player-driven efforts in the fight for social justice, the nfl this week handed out 13 new grants to nonprofit organizations across the country as part of the inspire change initiative.\n\ninspire change is the product of the partnership formed between the players and owners during the 2018 season and focuses on education, economic advancement, police and community relations and criminal justice reform. to date, the league and its teams have provided more than $95 million to programs across the country.\n\nthis year's new grants — which total roughly $4.3 million, according to the league — include new partners whose missions are aimed at helping to close the digital divide.\n\neducation is a basic human right, and we can no longer deprive students of the tools they need to succeed, including devices and the internet, arizona cardinals offensive lineman kelvin beachum, also a players coalition task force member and player-owner social justice working group member, said in a press release. i am proud of the work players coalition and the nfl has done to help close this 'digital divide' and help those children in underserved communities.\n\nthis year's 13 grant recipients join a roster of 20 organizations that the players and owners have and continued to sponsor since forming their partnership.\n\nthe 2021 recipients:\n\n• the association for enterprise opportunity, which is based in d.c. and provides strategic and developmental assistance to black owned businesses and targets the wealth gap that exists between black and white american families.\n\n• boys & girls clubs of america, which plans to use the funding to help create the tlc youth advocacy process, an effort to further educate 5,000 teens and build advocacy capacity via service-learning projects.\n\n• breakthrough miami, whose changemaker leadership track supports breakthrough scholars and recent alumni to build capacities to challenge the digital divide, gain early work experience, college advising, financial literacy and leadership development.\n\n• l.a.-based center for policing equity, and its efforts to expand compstat usage – a software that tracks incidents, identifies trends and holds departments accountable by measuring crime.\n\n• covenant house, which is based in new york and focuses on workforce development and education services across the u.s. while serving youth and young families facing homelessness.\n\n• just city-memphis and its memphis community bail fund, the clean slate fund, and court watch programs.\n\n• bronx-based ladies of hope ministries and its faces of women imprisoned speakers bureau, parole and probation accountability project, and epic ambassadors policy advocacy project.\n\n• mentor, which provides resources and tools on virtual mentoring made available to mentoring programs nationwide.\n\n• oregon justice resource center and its support of women's justice project – the first and only program in oregon that addresses the needs of women in the criminal justice system.\n\n• brooklyn's per scholas, which enrolls 220 new individuals into its software engineering courses – a 15-week, full-time training program that will include technical instruction and professional development in efforts to advance economic equity.\n\n• texas appleseed's work in three areas that disproportionately affect black and latinx texans from low-income backgrounds: driver's license suspensions, criminal record expungement and debt collection.\n\n• united way worldwide's young men united initiative, which aims to support 25,000 young men of color in the united states to and through post-secondary and into entry-level career positions.\n\n• silver spring, maryland's us dream academy and its children of incarcerated parents initiative, which provides mentorship, leadership training, educational support and career readiness for a unique population of primarily black and latinx young people in communities harmed by racial bias and mass incarceration.
elizabeth weise\n\nusatoday\n\nsan francisco — uber is going to make urban traffic and mobility data gleaned from its millions of drivers and riders using the uber app freely available to all.\n\nthe data, which shows anonymized travel times between points in cities, will be available on a public website called uber movement.\n\nuber says it will first invite planning agencies and researchers to access the information and then make the website free to the public. the first cities will be washington d.c., manilaand sydney.\n\nthe san francisco-based company decided to release the data when it realized it had this very valuable but untapped resource for understanding a city's transportation infrastructure, said andrew salzberg, uber's head of transportation policy.\n\npegged to a transportation conference in dc on sunday, the release is also likely is a bid to gain some goodwill with cities, with which uber has often had bare-knuckled fights over regulation.\n\nthe announcement comes as uber, lyft and other ride-hailing companies face demands from cities that they provide more information about their riders — demands they have long opposed.\n\nthe most recent square off is in new york city, where new york's taxi & limousine commission will hold a public hearing on thursday a demand that uber give the city information about where and when drivers drop off passengers, something taxi drivers already are required to do.\n\nuber movement doesn't map individuals rides, but rather segments of rides, focusing on travel time between specific points, gilbertson said.\n\nwe're using ride data as a proxy, we're taking periodic gps trace pings during the rides, he said.\n\nfor example, the uber data showed changes in travel times in the washington d.c. area when parts of the regional metro were shut down for repairs.\n\nthe uber data will give cities a low-cost way to do high-resolution travel time analysis. robust traffic data of the sort needed by planners is often either expensive or out-of-date.\n\nfor us in the planning context, it's very interesting, said jascha franklin-hodge, boston's chief information officer.\n\noftentimes, cities and state transportation systems use things like toll transponders to show how long it takes to get from one place to another. but those are on fixed routes. what's interesting is this allow us to look at a lot of different routes, he said.\n\nthe uber data makes it possible to reliably estimate how long it takes to get from one area of a city to another by analyzing multiple trips over time.\n\nto protect the privacy of uber drivers and passengers, only areas with relatively high tip volume are included. otherwise it might be possible to track the movement of a unique individual if only a few uber trips went through a specific area in a given time.\n\non the maps, uber grays out areas where trip numbers are too low to protect driver privacy.\n\nthe company has been beta testing the program with washington d.c. the data will initially be available for a limited number of cities which will be added to over time. uber currently is active in 450 cities worldwide.\n\nwhile the data isn't comprehensive enough to allow city planners to rely solely on it, it will be helpful. it also should be a boost to public engagement with planners, said boston's franklin.\n\nthis gives people tools to ask us questions. that's really powerful. we believe in having an informed public and having conversations that are rooted in facts, so the more of facts that are available, the better, he said.
david jackson\n\nusa today\n\npresident-elect donald trump tapped a new trade ambassador tuesday while tweeting on topics ranging from congressional ethics to trade policy to changing president obama's health care plan to keeping open the guantanamo bay prison.\n\nin nominating former reagan administration official robert lighthizer to be his u.s. trade representative, trump echoed the attacks he made on various trade deals during the presidential campaign.\n\nlighthizer has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting americans, trump said in a statement. he will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many americans of prosperity.\n\na critic of china trade practices in particular, lighthizer said he is fully committed to president-elect trump's mission to level the playing field for american workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all americans.\n\ntrump made the announcement while preparing for another day of briefings and jobs interviews at his manhattan office tower.\n\nthe president-elect also stayed busy on social media. in a flurry of new tweets, trump:\n\n• questioned house republicans for gutting a congressional ethics investigating committee, tweeting that the gop should focus on issues like tax reform and health care; however, trump also described the independent ethics committee's work as unfair. house republicans later reversed course on plans to end the committee's work.\n\n• threatened general motors — and presumably other companies — with the imposition of a border tax over operations in mexico.\n\n• again pledged to dismantle president obama's health care plan, saying it just doesn't work, and it is not affordable.\n\n• warned obama against last-minute releases from the terrorism prisoner camp at guantanamo bay, cuba; these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield, he tweeted.\n\nlater in the week, trump plans to receive a special security briefing on allegations that russia orchestrated the hacking of democratic officials during last year's presidential election, aides said. trump, who has questioned whether russia was involved, is awaiting a final report being developed by intelligence agencies at obama's request.\n\namong the jobs he plans to fill in the coming days: director of national intelligence, secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nread more:\n\nwho has trump picked for his cabinet so far?\n\ntrump blasts gm for mexican-made chevy cruze\n\nduring the presidential campaign, trump vowed to kill the proposed trans-pacific partnership deal with pacific rim nations. he also vowed to re-negotiate, or possibly scrap, the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico.\n\ntrade played a role in trump's latest tweet storm, as he criticized general motors for making chevrolets in mexico and selling them in the united states.\n\nin announcing the selection of lighthizer, the trump transition team noted that he served reagan as deputy united states trade representative, playing a major role in developing trade policy for the reagan administration and negotiating roughly two dozen bilateral international agreements on a variety of topics from steel to grain. these agreements were uniformly tough and frequently resulted in significant reductions in the shipment of unfairly traded imports into the united states.\n\nin recent years, lighthizer has worked on trade issues as a partner with the law firm of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom.\n\nthe senate must still confirm lighthizer's nomination as trade representative.\n\nthere is some question as to how much power the trade representative will have in a trump administration.\n\nthe president-elect has said he will give more trade authority to the commerce department, to be headed up by billionaire investor wilbur ross.\n\ntrump also picked another china critic, peter navarro, to head up a new white house office overseeing trade and industrial policy.
jim waymer\n\nflorida today\n\nmelbourne, fla. — federal regulators have denied six pending permits for using high-powered airguns to scan the ocean floor for signs of oil and gas deposits from florida to delaware.\n\nthe permits were no longer needed because the federal government removed those waters from the list of areas available to be leased for oil and gas exploration between 2017 and 2022, according to a release friday from the bureau of ocean energy management.\n\nenvironmental groups touted the decision as a major victory for coastal habitats and future tourism, while industry officials said it would hamper america's energy independence, scientific knowledge and jobs.\n\nhorrific, david mica, executive director of the florida petroleum council, a division of the american petroleum institute, said of the decision. this agency has stated over and over again — even under this administration — how safe and efficient and how scientifically proven geological science is to do this. so i see it as a horrific political example that's only the latest in disregarding american energy security needs.\n\nthe use of airgun seismic surveys would have generated maps or models of rock distributions and other geological structures to show potential for oil and gas deposits. but conservation groups worried that the seismic testing could harm marine life, especially endangered north atlantic right whales.\n\nu.s. oil companies poised for rebound\n\nthat really put our right whales at risk, said amy tidd of rockledge, who organized anti-oil-drilling rallies at florida beaches. we need to protect our marine mammals. i think this is a great step toward protecting them and protecting our beaches.\n\nboem officials said it's unlikely the information from seismic airgun surveys would be used if the federal government does not offer the atlantic for future oil and gas leasing. the agency also pointed out that even if the area is opened to drilling in the future, the information gathered would become outdated.\n\nthe deep-penetration seismic surveys are conducted by vessels that tow an array of airguns that emit acoustic energy pulses into the seafloor over large areas and long periods of time, according to boem. the airguns penetrate several thousand meters beneath the seafloor.\n\nconservation groups worry the airguns could harm whales, dolphins and other marine life.\n\nnumerous studies demonstrate the negative impacts that seismic airgun noise has on ocean ecosystems, including reduced catch rates of commercially valuable fish and silencing bowhead whales, the nonprofit group oceana said in a press release. the government's own estimates state that seismic airgun blasting in the atlantic could injure as many as 138,000 marine mammals like dolphins and whales, while disturbing the vital activities of millions more.\n\nshallow-depth surveys for other purposes typically don't use airguns. while surveys may have some impacts to marine life, airgun seismic surveys have the potential for greater impacts, boem officials said.\n\nmore than 120 east coast municipalities, 1,200 elected officials, 35,000 businesses and 500,000 fishing families have publicly opposed offshore drilling and/or seismic airgun blasting, according to oceana, which has fought against the seismic testing.\n\ncocoa beach was one of the cities that passed resolutions against seismic airgun testing.\n\nwe're pretty happy, cocoa beach mayor ben malik said of friday's decision. we're pretty sensitive to our coast and making sure it's preserved for future generations.\n\nthe pending permits from oil or gas exploration spanned from delaware to florida.\n\nearlier this month, obama declared certain federal waters of the atlantic and arctic oceans off-limits to offshore oil and gas drilling — for good.\n\nthe ban does not include atlantic waters off florida and would not affect current oil and gas leases, but it aims to stop indefinitely the sale of new leases in an area of the atlantic stretching from about rhode island to southern maryland — and in the arctic's chukchi and beaufort seas north of alaska.\n\nobama designated 31 atlantic canyons along the continental shelf off limits to oil and gas exploration and development due to their critical and irreplaceable ecological value. the withdrawn area totals 5,990 square miles (or 3.8 million acres). the measure would protect deep-sea coral, fish habitat and other marine life, administration officials said.\n\napi director of upstream and industry operations erik milito said friday's decision harms the nation's energy security, scientific research and was politically driven.\n\nwe are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this short-sighted course, milito said in a prepared statement, and base its decisions on facts so that we can have a forward-looking energy policy to help keep energy affordable for american consumers and businesses, help create jobs, and strengthen our national security.\n\ntidd said the airgun permit denials are also a victory for florida's economy.\n\nour economy depends on clean beaches. and to do anything that puts that at risk is

corrections & clarifications: an earlier version of this story mischaracterized the shutdown's current impact on growth.\n\nwhen the next recession strikes, it won't be as bad as the last one, j.p. morgan chase ceo jamie dimon predicted tuesday.\n\nyou will have a recession. it just won't be like you had the last time in ... affecting the banking system, he said in a call tuesday with analysts after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nthe chief executive said the larger banks have been more prudent when approving new loans. it's the newer, non-bank lenders – dubbed shadow banks – that could have problems during a recession, he predicted.\n\nsomeone's going to get hurt, he said. the issue there for the marketplace is going to be, we have a recession, the lender will not be there. so a lot of these borrowers will be stranded.\n\nmore money: ask hr: my boss has body odor and bad breath. what can i do about this issue?\n\nmore money:chick-fil-a testing spicy new menu items in select markets, considering nationwide rollout\n\ndimon didn't forecast when he expected a downturn to occur. the company's chief financial officer, marianne lake, said despite some softness recently in manufacturing and capital expenditures, the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong, especially among consumers.\n\nit's good, dimon agreed.\n\ngovernment shutdown concerns\n\ndimon also weighed in on the partial government shutdown in an earlier call with the media. he repeated recent estimates by some economists that the government shutdown could sap all growth from the world's biggest economy.\n\nsomeone estimated that if it goes on for the whole quarter, it can reduce growth to zero, dimon said. we just have to deal with that. it's more of a political issue than anything else.\n\nhis figures aren't off, says dean baker, a senior economist at the center for economic and policy research in washington, d.c.\n\nfurloughed workers make up about 0.5 percent of the total u.s. workforce and contribute roughly about the same to the economy, he said. that means an extended shutdown could shrink the economy by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, he said, which would reduce its growth rate by 2 percent on an annual basis.\n\nso, if it lasts the whole quarter, zero growth is very plausible, for the first quarter, baker wrote in an email to usa today.\n\ndimon's comments on the shutdown come on the same day that delta air lines' ceo said the airline is losing about $25 million in business because of the shutdown. ed bastian told cnbc that fewer government employees and contractors are traveling, resulting in the decline.
nick mccarvel\n\nspecial to usa today sports\n\nmelbourne - tennis officials sounded off monday afternoon at a buzzfeed and bbc report that claimed match-fixing is still a problem in tennis, and includes cases that involve a top 50 player and former grand slam singles and doubles champions.\n\nthe tennis integrity unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn't being thoroughly investigated, atp chairman chris kermode said in a press conference called to address the report.\n\nthe tennis integrity unit, or the tiu, was set up in 2008 to investigate match fixing at every level of the sport. in its existence, 18 convictions have been made, including six life bans.\n\nall of us here are absolutely committed to stamp out any corrupt conduct, kermode said. there is a zero-tolerance policy. all sport, just not tennis, is at risk to corruption … and that is why in 2008 the tiu was set up to tackle this issue head-on.\n\nnigel willerton, the director of the tiu, would neither confirm nor deny that there were any players currently on the tour that are being investigated by the tiu.\n\nthe buzzfeed/bbc report said that the tiu had been warned about 16 core players as part of the scandal, all of whom had been ranked inside the top 50 at some point, but none of whom were sanctioned. the focus of the report was a 2008 probe that it says was shelved by tennis authorities, ignoring evidence presented with a nice pink bow that they took no action at all with.\n\nthe governing bodies of tennis (itf, atp world tour, wta and the four grand slam events) issued a joint statement calling out the report for using what they call information, suspicion or hearsay over evidence, as kermode noted in his comments.\n\nwillerton added that the tiu can make demands of personal phones and laptops of players they suspect to be involved in match-fixing. when needed, the tiu works with necessary law enforcement.\n\nall eyes on novak djokovic as he starts quest for elusive grand slam\n\nit's always disappointing when stories like this come out in front of an event, kermode said, noting that the story was released on the eve of the first grand slam of 2016, the australian open. we are confident there is nothing in the sport that has been suppressed. the tiu tackles this issue. tennis is in a very, very good place.\n\nsome $14 million have been invested in the tiu and it's constantly being reviewed kermode said.\n\nthe main press room in rod laver arena was packed to the gills as a host of international media attended the press conference, which included officials from the wta, itf, u.s. tennis association and the sport's other biggest bodies.\n\nkermode stressed that the tiu focuses on evidence over information.\n\nthe buzzfeed and bbc investigation suggested that the tiu was understaffed, calling it a plastic solution that has furthered the match-fixing problem in tennis.\n\naustin krajicek, an american ranked no. 82 in the world and who has played most of his career on the lower-level challenge circuit (where match-fixing has been found at its most prevalent in the past, told usa today sports he had never been approached by betters or heard of match-fixing separate from rumors.\n\ni've never been approached, he said. i know the atp takes that stuff really seriously. to be honest, i've never heard of someone being approached. i've heard rumors, but i haven't had any contact with it. it can't be tolerated.
las vegas – sex toys are back on the ces show floor. and lora haddock dicarlo deserves a lot of the credit.\n\nwe want to reshape how people think about sex tech, says the ceo and founder of the company that bears her name and markets such products.\n\nwe shamed pleasure (tech) for so long, she says. the fact is that sexual health and wellness (products) are health and wellness products.\n\nthat's the category under which the consumer technology association (cta), which organizes the event, is letting such companies exhibit at the 2020 industry shindig. but it took some convincing.\n\nin dicarlo's telling, the backstory begins with an orgasm, leading to the company's first in a family of hands-free robotic massagers called osé. osé emerged in partnership with the robotics lab at oregon state university, which, dicarlo points out, included several female engineers.\n\nher company applied for and was granted a ces innovation award for the prototype that was osé, stating up-front that the product is meant to stimulate a woman's g-spot and clitoris. but about a month later, when lora dicarlo asked for osé to be included in a product showcase at ces and to exhibit at the show, the cta took the award away on the grounds, dicarlo says, that they found it immoral, obscene, and profane.\n\nces flashback:if lg's rollable oled tv sounds familiar, there's a reason\n\nvoice tech:for people who stutter, the convenience remains out of reach\n\nwhat caught our eye:4 cool gadgets at ces\n\na backlash ensued over the sexist stance toward the female-focused product, and the cta eventually bowed to the pressure. it not only apologized to dicarlo and reversed its reversal of the award, but began a dialogue with her that resulted in a new policy, opening up floor space in the health and wellness area for such sex tech exhibitors.\n\nthe ban actually raised dicarlo's profile and, while not necessarily the route she would have chosen, has been good for business. she pre-sold more than 10,000 osé units in december (at $290 each), and has tripled the size of the company. at ces 2020, dicarlo's company will unveil two new bio-mimetic pleasure devices under the names baci and onda.\n\ncontroversy over sex is nothing new for ces. in its earliest days, the show incorporated members of the porn industry.\n\nthe adult entertainment expo eventually became its own event, though for some years it ran concurrently with ces, though not presently.\n\naside from that, many companies at ces have employed attractive scantily clad booth babes, the term coined for women whose job it is to lure foot traffic to a mostly male audience. the cta has said it maintains the right to remove people wearing what it considers inappropriate attire.\n\ncritics of the show have also complained through the years about the lack of inclusiveness when it comes to speaking roles, with most prominent keynote slots given to male executives.\n\nat this year's ces, ivanka trump will be speaking which has generated its own controversy.\n\nfor her part, dicarlo says the inclusion of sex tech exhibitors is all about normalizing the way people talk about a subject deemed by some as off-limits. we believe that having open conversations about our bodies and human sexuality is the right thing to do, she says.\n\nstill, it will be worth watching over the next several days the kind of response sex tech actually gets.\n\nthe big question for me is how brands will talk and position these gadgets, says carolina milanesi, an analyst with creative strategies. will it be about women, their pleasure and health or, as we very often see, the gadgets marketed will be about men?\n\nemail: ebaig@usatoday.com; follow @edbaig on twitter.
bart jansen\n\nusa today\n\nthe transportation department thinks airline travelers should know all the bag and seat-assignment fees they face before paying for a ticket. but after proposing in may 2014 to require airlines to provide that information, the administration continues to grapple with hundreds of comments on all sides of the issue.\n\nthe department's plan aims to alert travelers to the precise fees regardless of where they purchase their tickets. half of all tickets are bought somewhere other than from airlines directly. shopping at comparison web sites can be complicated, and some airlines change fees based on frequent-flier status or even the credit card used to buy a ticket.\n\nbut the proposal stopped short of requiring airlines to charge the fee at the moment the ticket is bought, something that consumer advocates had urged as a policy called transactability. some travelers have complained about fees that surprise them upon arrival at the airport.\n\nas airlines divide their ticket prices into optional services such as bags, seating and food, the fees have grown into big business, with bag fees totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, according to the department's bureau of transportation statistics.\n\nif the rule is adopted, airlines would have to disclose fees for first and second checked bags, carry-on bags and for advanced seat assignments that often provide extra legroom before the traveler pays for the ticket.\n\nthe department remains of the view that as carriers continue to unbundle services that used to be included in the price of air transportation, passengers need to be protected from 20 hidden and deceptive fees and allowed to price shop for air transportation in an effective manner, the 118-page proposal says.\n\nafter receiving more than 750 comments, dot has been grappling with whether to change or scrap anything in the proposal. no deadline is set for action, but the department's latest formal estimate is that the proposal will be finalized by june.\n\nit's urgent, said charlie leocha, chairman of consumer-advocate travelers united. the sooner we do it, the sooner that consumers can start to comparison shop.\n\nmelanie hinton, a spokesman for the trade group airlines for america, said it would be premature to comment on a rule before it is finalized. but she argued that airlines are already one of the most transparent industries for pricing, with the market dictating prices that are considerably less and far more plentiful than under government regulation.\n\ncustomers today are able to choose among carriers and select the best services offerings, hinton said.\n\ndot extends deadline to comment on airline fees, performance\n\nairlines argued that the department doesn't have the power to regulate fees after congress deregulated the industry in 1978, because the services are optional. but the department contends it is authorized under a section of federal law calling on it to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in air transportation.\n\nas much or more than any other industry, airlines depend upon repeat customers to sustain the business model, delta air lines said in its comments on the rule. delta has every incentive not to treat our customers unfairly or deceptively, and we strive to clearly and accurately inform our customers about delta's fees for ancillary services, specifically including baggage and preferred seating.\n\nthe proposal is the third in a string of aviation consumer rules, with the first adopted in 2009. earlier rules set large fines for lengthy tarmac delays and forced airlines to post the full cost of a ticket with taxes when advertising fares.\n\nthe u.s. travel association said nearly half (45%) of 1,031 travelers surveyed in february 2014 found it difficult to budget for travel because of fees, and that one-fourth faced a fee at the airport they didn't anticipate.\n\nfrancis komola of bradford, mass., told the department that making the cost more obvious for advanced seat assignments that provide extra legroom is the most important part of the proposal.\n\na significant amount of personal information has to be provided to united airlines, for example, before the total cost of the flight is available to customers like me, komola said.\n\na rule that went into effect in january 2012 required airlines to notify passengers that baggage fees may apply and to post fees on their websites. the specific fees for first and second checked bags must be included in the summary after a purchase and post-purchase email.\n\nbut travelers complain that some airlines don't include fees in the initial purchase, and it becomes a surprise at the airport.\n\ndisplaying all fees as part of the ticket price levels the playing field and makes it much easier for consumers to compare apples to apples, said matthew kirkland of watkinsville, ga.\n\nsenate studies airline fees at $6 billion and growing\n\nof course, the industry isn't monolithic. southwest airlines promotes its lack of baggage fees and supports greater transparency for its rivals that may also exert downward pressure on fees.\n\npart of the dispute involves the technical side of how travelers shop for fares. travel agents, whether mom-and-pop shops or online sites, urged the department to force airlines to provide detailed fees so they could relay them to customers.\n\nit would not be remotely practical for a ticket agent to establish direct connections with hundreds of airlines in order to obtain the data and comply with the proposed disclosure obligations, priceline.com told the department.\n\nbut delta warned that making ticket searches more complicated could dampen sales. travelers highly value speed and efficiency in the reservations process and tend to abandon searches after 430 seconds, the carrier said.\n\namerican airlines cited department cost estimates that the fee provision would cost airlines $46 million over a decade and yield benefits of $25 million. the cost estimate was based on additional technology -- for equipment, software and labor -- to post the fees, according to a dot analysis. the projected benefits are based on consumers buying more optional services and airlines reducing their administrative costs for managing complaints, the dot analysis said.\n\nthe costs at issue are quite real and will inevitably be passed along to consumers in this intensely competitive industry, the carrier said.\n\nunited airlines said requiring fees with search results involving multiple carriers would take longer and lead to information overload.\n\nunited has learned over many years — through extensive consumer feedback and other empirical observations — that many customers do not want this information at any point, and certainly not when they are looking at the first display that shows their search results, the carrier said.\n\nairline: 10 'bizarre' things fliers have done to avoid bag fees
zeke miller\n\nassociated press\n\njerusalem – president donald trump's national security adviser, john bolton, said sunday that the u.s. military withdrawal from northeastern syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the islamic state group, and on turkey assuring the safety of kurdish fighters allied with the united states.\n\nbolton, who traveled to israel to reassure the u.s. ally of the trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of american forces in northeastern syria, but insisted it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nthere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, bolton told reporters in jerusalem. the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nthose conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of is in syria, and protections for kurdish militias who have fought alongside u.s. troops against the extremist group.\n\nbolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of defense secretary jim mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.\n\ntrump announced in mid-december that the u.s. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in syria. trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a turkish assault on kurdish fighters in syria who fought alongside american troops against is extremists. turkey considers the syrian kurdish people's protection units, or ypg, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nbolton, who is to travel on to turkey on monday, said the u.s. is insisting that its kurdish allies in the fight against the islamic state group are protected from any planned turkish offensive. he is to deliver a warning to turkish president recep tayyip erdogan this week.\n\nwe don't think the turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the united states, bolton said.\n\ntrump has stated that he would not allow turkey to kill the kurds, bolton said. that's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\n\nbolton said the u.s. has asked its kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from russia or syrian president bashar al-assad's government. he said chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. joseph dunford would continue negotiations with his turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for america's kurdish allies in syria.\n\nhe added that ambassador jim jeffrey, who has been serving since august as the special representative for syrian engagement and was named last week as the american special envoy for the anti-islamic state coalition, would travel to syria this week in an effort to reassure the u.s.'s kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned.\n\nbolton said u.s. troops would remain at the critical are of al-tanf, in southern syria, to counter growing iranian activity in the region. he defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's constitutional authority, adding i'm a strong believer in article ii.\n\nbolton on sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the western wall in jerusalem's old city. he watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his israeli equivalent, as well as u.s. ambassador to israel david friedman and israel's ambassador to the u.s., ron dermer.\n\nvisiting american officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east jerusalem, which is contested between israelis and palestinians. trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit. israel captured the old city from jordan in the 1967 war.
adam shell\n\nusa today\n\nu.s. long-term government bonds are in demand again and the dollar is losing some of its luster as wall street downgrades its views on interest rate hikes.\n\nwith markets experiencing turbulence and the global economy facing myriad headwinds, investors are again flocking to the perceived haven of bonds issued by uncle sam. the reason: wall street is pretty much ruling out a march rate hike by the federal reserve and thinks the u.s. central bank may remain on hold for the remainder of the year.\n\nthat shift in thinking about u.s. interest rate policy is pushing the value of the dollar down, a development that is positive for commodities and for u.s. multinationals that do a lot of business abroad.\n\non wednesday, the yield on the 10-year treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, hit an intraday low of 1.79%, its lowest yield since feb.5, 2015 — or a 12-month low. the yield has since crept back up to 1.90% in early trading thursday but the sub-2% yield is a sign rate hikes are no longer a big fear on wall street -- at least for now.\n\nthe dollar also weakened wednesday, a trend that remains in place in early trading thursday.\n\nthe weakening dollar tells me investors are sensing there's no way the fed can tighten anytime soon, nick sargen, senior investment advisor at fort washington investment advisors, told usa today.\n\ninvestors' renewed love affair with u.s. government bonds also follows a weaker-than-expected january reading on the u.s. services sector, which is a key pillar of the consumer-focused u.s. economy. the weaker number, released wednesday, led to speculation that the federal reserve would not raise rates at its march meeting -- and may pass on rate hikes altogether this year. the fed earlier this year had said it would like to hike rates another full percentage point in 2016 after a quarter-point hike in december. but wall street is now questioning that so-called hawkish pace of rate hikes.\n\nsome pundits believe the bond market may be sniffing out a coming recession, or at least pricing in a greater probability of a slowdown, due in large part to global pressures from places such as china and emerging markets -- and the downside fallout of the dollars sharp rise against other currencies prior to this week's reversal.\n\nthe downward pressure on yields is causing pain in shares of banks, however, which benefit from rising rates as they can lend money at higher rates and benefit from a wider spread between rates they charge borrowers and interest they pay savers. in wednesday trading, bank stocks, including bank of america, citigroup and wells fargo, briefly touched fresh 52-week lows before mounting a late rebound. the biggest worry for bank stocks is the prospect of fed rate hikes getting pushed out, says ralph bassett, head of north american equities at aberdeen asset management.
nancy tengler\n\nspecial to usa today\n\nthe stock market is rational, despite what it looks like.\n\nwhich brings me to the latest report on u.s. hiring from friday.\n\nthe change in nonfarm payrolls in the report disappointed some. new jobs came in below expectations at a net addition of 145,000 jobs in december versus estimates of 160,000. november's blowout number of 266,000 new jobs was revised down by 10,000 jobs. good, but not spectacular.\n\nthe unemployment rate remained at a 50-year low. it would appear just about everyone who wants to work is working. job growth is not too hot to spark inflation concerns and not too low to signal inflation. which is likely to keep the fed on the sidelines.\n\nand then there is the fact that wages aren't growing as fast as the experts expected.\n\naverage hourly earnings rose a modest 0.1% in december compared to an estimate of 0.3%. year over year, average hourly earnings rose a manageable 2.9%, again versus expectations of 3.1%.\n\nmost popular models in each state:ford's f-series remains america's best-selling vehicle, but in 19 states these models were more popular\n\nbuying a home may be easier:more starter homes are getting built\n\nbut consumers don't need significant wage increases to prosper. despite unexpectedly low wage growth, the consumer is confident and still spending. that is because inflation is well below 2%, interest rates are near historic lows, tax-cuts increased net take-home pay and energy costs are muted. since the american consumer drives two-thirds of domestic gdp growth (and 17% of global gdp growth) he or she matters to growth. and the picture looks pretty rosy.\n\nso, friday's job report is bullish for stocks for three reasons.\n\n1. the fed is more likely to stay on the sidelines, with jobs growing at reasonable but not blowout levels and wage growth manageable. think of steady jobs and wage growth as the sweet spot for fed policy which is good for stock investors.\n\n2. if americans are working, they are contributing to their 401(k) accounts, putting money into the market every two weeks and potentially driving stock prices higher. as companies buy back shares while investors increase allocation to stocks – supply becomes scarcer in the face of increased demand. it's econ 101.\n\n3. if wage growth remains muted (as it did in december), corporate margins are not at risk. the worry for investors has been that as the unemployment rate reaches historic lows and the employment participation rate maxes out, wage pressure would rise and negatively impact corporate earnings and margins. that does not yet seem to be happening – another bit of good news for stocks.\n\nwhen you are tempted to throw in the towel and declare the market irrational, remember that it is a forward discounting mechanism that is already looking past today's news to what that means for the future.\n\nwe believe that the market may need a correction to prune excesses and reaccelerate from here. but when a sell-off occurs, remember that the underlying fundamentals for stock performance continue to be more bullish than not. and if your neighbors are working, that is better for the economy and good for all of us.\n\nnancy tengler is chief investment strategist at tengler wealth management, butcherjoseph asset management and the author of the women's guide to successful investing.
ap\n\niowa city, iowa (ap) — former nfl and iowa safety tyler sash, who died last year at age 27, has been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nchris nowinski of the boston university-affiliated concussion legacy foundation confirmed the diagnosis on tuesday night. the new york times was the first to report the finding.\n\ncte, which can be diagnosed only after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former football players. linked to repeated brain trauma, it is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, impaired judgment, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.\n\nsash, who won a super bowl during his rookie season with the new york giants, was found dead at his home on sept. 8. the iowa state medical examiner's office found he died from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor.\n\nmonths after the super bowl victory, sash was suspended for four games in 2012 for violating the nfl's performance-enhancing substances policy by testing positive for adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the sleep disorder narcolepsy. the giants cut ties with sash prior to the 2013 opener, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the preseason finale against new england.\n\nat iowa, sash started 37 games from 2007-10, earning first-team all-big ten honors in his final season. he bypassed his fourth year of eligibility to enter the nfl draft.

(ap) — marshawn lynch strolled through the locker room he's called home for most of the past six seasons on monday followed closely by a pack of cameras.\n\nwhether this was lynch's final time in the seattle seahawks locker room remains to be determined.\n\ni don't know how that's going to go, seattle coach pete carroll said on monday. i don't know how any of these guys are going to go right now. i don't know.\n\nthe future of lynch in seattle is one of the big questions the seahawks face entering the offseason.\n\nafter an injury-filled season where lynch played in just seven regular-season games, the seahawks must determine whether it's time to move on or keep beast mode around for another season at a hefty cost.\n\nall signs point to the marriage ending, especially with lynch costing $11.5 million against seattle's salary cap for the 2016 season if he returns.\n\nbut no one was willing to go so far as make declarative statements one day after seattle's season ended in a 31-24 loss to carolina in the nfc divisional playoff game.\n\nwe'll figure it out. it depends on how he comes back and how he works at it and all that kind of stuff, carroll said. he had a difficult year physically.\n\nlynch was limited to just 111 carries and 417 yards in the regular season because of a hamstring injury early in the season and abdominal surgery in late november that sidelined him for the final seven games of the regular season.\n\nlynch appeared ready to return for the nfc wild-card game at minnesota, but backed out of making the trip to minneapolis on the friday before the game telling the team he didn't think he could play.\n\nlynch returned for sunday's game at carolina, but was barely a factor in the run game with seattle quickly falling behind 14-0 and trailing 31-0 at halftime. lynch had six carries for 20 yards and caught two passes.\n\nwhile lynch was out, rookie thomas rawls emerged as a potential replacement long term. rawls led seattle with 890 yards rushing in the regular season and averaged 5.6 yards per carry before suffering a broken ankle in week 14 at baltimore. rawls said monday he'll be out of his cast in the next few weeks.\n\ni let things work out the way that they work out, rawls said. everything is out of my control. what i can control is going out there and preparing, and showing what i can do. everything thing else is for the guys upstairs.\n\n___\n\nap nfl website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/ap_nfl

orrin g. hatch\n\nright now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in latin america, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. joshua holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding american citizen, was arrested by venezuelan authorities in june 2016 and jailed on false charges. his health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\njosh's story is the nightmare of any american traveling abroad.\n\nmore:iran unrest threatens tehran's tyrants. can protesters drive them out?\n\nmore:on immigration, trump is positioned to do what obama and bush couldn't\n\njosh first flew to venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, thamara caleno holt, a young venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. in clear violation of the vienna convention, venezuelan authorities not only denied josh medical attention but also barred access to u.s. consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nfor months, josh's case has languished in venezuelan courts. and while venezuelan authorities dither, josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. with his case scheduled to move to trial in january, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if u.s. officials will even be able to help josh in legal proceedings. the venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nthe tragedy is that josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. i know josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. as a case in point, josh served for two years as a mormon missionary in washington prior to his marriage. it was in this setting that he learned spanish and developed a deep love for the hispanic people, culture and customs. that he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nfrom the time of josh's arrest last year, i have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. i have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of state rex tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with venezuelan authorities. i even raised the issue of josh's captivity with president trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on venezuela and called on president nicolas maduro to set josh free.\n\nas a leader looking to do what is good and just, president maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of josh and thamy on humanitarian grounds. this action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. with this gesture of goodwill, the governments of venezuela and the united states could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nthe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and i invite president maduro to take the first step. doing so would bring relief to the holt family and usher in a new era of u.s.-venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\n\nmore:the second 'persian spring' is upon us. here's how we can make it last.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nvenezuela and the united states have significant policy differences, to be sure. but working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent american and his wife, who is herself a native of venezuela. josh and thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\n\nas the senior member and former chairman of the senate judiciary committee, i recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. but i believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\n\nthat's why president maduro should release josh and thamy holt. he must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\n\ni call on him to help us bring josh home.\n\norrin hatch is the senior senator from utah, and president pro tempore of the united states senate.
gabriel schoenfeld\n\nopinion columnist\n\ndonald trump's presidency has struck an iceberg on both sides of its hull. starboard, with the indictment of roger stone, special counsel robert mueller's investigation is circling ever closer to the president himself. port side, the disastrous 35-day government shutdown has left a growing number of republican pols unlashing themselves from the ss trump's mast and searching for life jackets. the question now, as we enter another presidential election cycle, is whether they will actually jump off the foundering ship.\n\n\n\nan increasingly attractive rescue vessel sailing by is larry hogan, the republican governor of heavily democratic maryland, who according to multiple news reports is contemplating a 2020 primary challenge to trump.\n\nof course, with trump's total domination of the gop and the national conversation, hogan and the others most frequently mentioned — such as sen. ben sasse of nebraska, former ambassador to the united nations nikki haley and former ohio gov. john kasich — seem like guppies up against a shark. but that could change, and hogan would be positioned well for a challenge.\n\nif trump is a scraping-from-the-bottom-of-the-barrel excuse of a human being — an ignorant, entitled, dishonest, braggadocious thug — hogan, in character, policy and political appeal, is in every respect the reverse, in full measure an anti-trump and more.\n\n\n\ntrump, of course, was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. for decades, he has used his inherited fortune to posture as a successful businessman, running serial scams (like trump university) and bringing about serial bankruptcies (like the trump taj mahal casino).\n\nread more commentary:\n\nhow billionaires like schultz and bloomberg can help america: don't run for president\n\nhoward schultz: a third-party centrist candidate like me could win the presidency\n\nhow the democrats could blow it in 2020\n\nbefore he won elective office in 2014, hogan, 62, was also a businessman. hogan companies, however, is not a shell game but a genuinely successful real estate firm with $2 billion in transactions under its account, built from the ground up, without daddy's largesse. hogan, though born into a political family, made his own way up.\n\n\n\nhogan did inherit one extremely valuable thing from his father. lawrence hogan sr., a onetime fbi agent, represented maryland in congress. in 1974, he was the first republican on the house judiciary committee to call for president richard nixon's impeachment. his readiness to put country before party is something his son regularly mentions in speeches.\n\nthe implication for trump is left clear but unsaid. that episode taught a lesson in fidelity to principle, which goes a considerable distance in explaining why hogan is one of the few republican elected officials who has never endorsed let alone truckled to the weakling bully in the white house.\n\n\n\nunsurprisingly, when it comes to private life, the contrast between the two men is stark. trump is a serial philanderer/sexual predator whose partners include multiple wives and a paid-off porn star. hogan has been married only once, and he and his wife, yumi hogan — a first generation korean-american — have never given the tabloids any occasion to visit their marriage.\n\nhogan style is civility and moderation\n\nmore centrally, trump has both campaigned and governed by stoking racial and religious resentment, allowing him to gain and retain the fierce loyalty of a narrow base of disaffected voters. hogan's philosophy is to govern with civility and moderation and so he has, regularly reaching across the aisle of the annapolis statehouse to advance a bipartisan agenda.\n\n\n\ntrump is renowned for the art of the deal, but that is a marketing slogan cooked up by a ghost writer. it has never borne any relation to trump's long career of shady business practices burnished only by boastfulness.\n\n\n\nhogan, for his part, speaks of the art of the possible. his political pragmatism is precisely what has made him a success. his signature initiatives don't grab headlines — like walling off mexico or banning muslims from entering the united states — but they are the unsexy work of good government: development of infrastructure, stewardship of the environment, innovation in k-12 education, access to affordable health care and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n\nas a national candidate, hogan has his liabilities. in this age of celebrities, his is hardly a household name. his reasoned brand of charisma would not rouse crowds to chant demagogic slogans at rallies. his foreign policy experience is a blank that would need to be filled. his 2015 diagnosis of lymphoma, now pronounced in complete remission, will raise worries over his long-term health.\n\ntrump's troubles are mounting\n\nof course, whether hogan or any republican could launch a successful primary challenge is in doubt as long as trump's cult of personality does not crack and approval of the president among republicans hovers in the 80s. even so, the fluidity of american politics and trump's mounting troubles raise the possibility of the ss trump sinking abruptly to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\nshould that come about, and were hogan to emerge against long odds as the republican nominee, he would likely prove to be a formidable force in a general election, particularly if the democrats lurched left.\n\n\n\nhogan regularly ranks as one of the most popular governors in the country, drawing support from democratic and republican voters alike, and earning approval numbers in the 70s. running for re-election last november, hogan beat democrat ben jealous by 12 percentage points, a striking accomplishment in one of the country's bluest states.\n\n\n\nof course, at this early stage, hogan must be considered, as other potential republican challengers, an exceedingly long shot. nonetheless, anyone who wants to glean the future of american politics should prepare to hear more from this serious and determined man.\n\ngabriel

washington – nearly 40% of judges president donald trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward lgbtq rights, according to a new report by the lgbt advocacy group lambda legal.\n\nthe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nour analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of lgbtq people as 'less than,' said sharon mcgowan, legal director for lambda legal.\n\ntrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the supreme court – an accomplishment made possible by senate republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for president-elect joe biden.\n\nafter four years as president, trump has appointed three supreme court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\n\na whiter judiciary:trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one hispanic nominee\n\naccording to lambda legal's report, released tuesday, the trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\n\nthis outpaced trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. during the obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. previous administrations going back to president ronald reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\n\ni think in many ways, trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the trump administration, mcgowan said.\n\nwhile the supreme court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of americans.\n\ntrump's legacy:biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\n\ncarrie severino, chief counsel at the conservative judicial crisis network, which has promoted and applauded trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\n\n(trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, severino said. the fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the constitution.\n\ntrump judges:trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nconversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\n\nthe report by lambda legal – which analyzed publicly available records on trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to lgbtq rights.\n\nin 2019, judge james ho, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a texas prison. ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nlater that year, judge david stras, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' first amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. the judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\n\nlast year, judge kyle duncan, whom trump also nominated to the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\n\nalso last year, two trump-nominated judges to the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting lgbtq minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. the american medical association and the american psychiatric association have discredited the practice.\n\nbut in the opinion, judge britt grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' first amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. judge barbara lagoa agreed with grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\n\nin a candid speech in november to the conservative federalist society, supreme court justice samuel alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\n\nyou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, alito said. until very recently, that's what the vast majority of americans thought. now it's considered bigotry.\n\nthe speech was widely criticized by democrats and advocates, including mcgowan. lambda legal also opposed alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\n\nmcgowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\n\nin the past, she said, lambda legal has won cases before republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against lgbtq rights.\n\nwe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by republicans or democrats. we did not oppose every single trump nominee. we did not paint them with the same brush, mcgowan said. but, she added, there should be a baseline below which we would never fall.\n\ncontributing: richard wolf
next week, kamala harris will make history as the first woman, black person and south asian american person inaugurated vice president of the united states.\n\nher climb from california attorney general to senator to vice president-elect has been well-documented in the news, as well as harris' own books, including 2008's smart on crime: a career prosecutor's plan to make us safer and 2019's the truths we hold: an american journey.\n\nkamala's way: an american life (simon & schuster, 257 pp.), out tuesday, promises a revelatory look at how a daughter of jamaican and indian immigrants became one of this country's most effective power players, according to a press release.\n\nvogue:kamala harris' team says they were blindsided by controversial cover\n\nthe new biography was written by veteran california journalist dan morain, who covered harris' career for decades at the sacramento bee and los angeles times. he aims to show not only the confident former top cop known for her fierce takedown of brett kavanaugh at a 2018 senate hearing but also the empathetic human fighting for racial justice, police reform and marriage equality.\n\nbecause harris, 56, and her family declined interviews for the book amid president-elect joe biden's campaign, kamala's way isn't particularly revelatory, dryly detailing her early days in the alameda county district attorney's office in california, as well as the political allies and adversaries she encountered during her rise. although meticulously reported, it occasionally reads like a slapdash wikipedia page rather than a compelling narrative.\n\nbut after the circus of the outgoing presidential administration, there is a level of comfort reading an exhaustive account of a lawmaker just putting in the work. it isn't a mere puff piece either, as morain rightfully holds harris accountable for her past support of capital punishment and mass incarceration policies.\n\nhere are some of the more illuminating stories that we learned from kamala's way about her life on and off the political stage:\n\nkamala harris' vp win:'powerful, emotional' moment for african american and south asian american women\n\nharris once comforted a young girl who was scared of gun violence\n\ncalling for smart gun safety laws, harris would frequently bemoan the slaughter of babies, as she recalled seeing harrowing autopsy photographs of young people killed by guns, morain writes. she took this approach while speaking at an event in downtown san francisco in late 2016, only to stop mid-speech.\n\nerin, i am so sorry. i forgot, harris said to erin lehane, a donor in the audience who had brought along her 7-year-old daughter, rose.\n\nharris, who had known rose since she was a baby, promised to talk to the young girl after the event. she pulled two chairs together as the room cleared out, and asked rose if her remarks frightened her.\n\nrose later told her mom that harris told her not to worry, that there were so many people who would protect her – her mom, her teachers, the police, morain writes.\n\nshe tried to be reassuring, lehane says in the book. she asked if rose had questions. she spent a huge chunk of time. there was no camera. there was no press. nobody knew. she was very human in that moment and wanted rose to feel safe.\n\nshe met her now-husband on a blind date\n\nharris' husband, lawyer doug emhoff, will make history as the first second gentleman of the united states. the couple met on a blind date in 2013, set up by harris' good friend chrisette hudlin, a public relations consultant.\n\nhudlin and her husband arranged a meeting with emhoff about a knotty legal issue, which they ended by asking if he was single. she told emhoff about harris, then-california attorney

number, and they met in los angeles that weekend. the two kept their courtship under the radar and were engaged in 2014. they were married that summer in a ceremony incorporating both indian and jewish traditions.\n\nthe couple share two children – cole, 26, and ella, 21 – from emhoff's previous marriage. the kids affectionately call harris momala, which she proudly displays in her twitter

adviser for hillary clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. she has long been harris' closest confidante and political adviser.\n\nduring campaigns, kamala and maya would talk several times a day, morain writes. often, a call with maya was the first of the day and last at night. their sense of humor is similar and the sound of their laugh is all but identical. they're brilliant, detail oriented, tough and competitive, sometimes even with each other in the ways big and little sisters can be.\n\nthe book also discusses harris' private struggles as her mom, scientist shyamala gopalan, underwent chemotherapy for colon cancer in 2008. in a 2018 op-ed for the new york times, harris recalled how her mom continued to support her even while she was hospitalized, shortly before her death in february 2009 at age 70.\n\ni remember i had just entered the race for california attorney general and she asked me how it was going, harris wrote.  'mommy, these guys are going to kick my a**,' i told her.\n\nshe rolled over and looked at me and unveiled the biggest smile, harris continued. she knew who she'd raised. she knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.

kaja whitehouse\n\nusa today\n\nnew york -- yet another pharmaceutical mega-merger is on the books.\n\nmore than five months after making its initial bid, biopharmaceutical company baxalta incorporated (bxlt) agreed to buy dublin, ireland-based shire (shp) in a deal valued at $32 billion, the companies said monday.\n\nthe companies reached a deal after overcoming concerns that a tie-up could create tax problems due to baxalta's spin-off from parent company baxter international last year. after conducting some due diligence, shire concluded that the merger will maintain the tax-free status of the baxalta spinoff from baxter, the companies said.\n\nit has been a record period for global mergers and acquisitions, led in good part by marriages among large pharmaceuticals and biotech companies.\n\npfizer's $160 billion purchase of drug company allergan, for example, marked the single largest deal of 2015, and helped to boosted total u.s.-based m&a to a record $4.28 trillion in 2015. that's 16.6% above the previous 2007 peak, and 29.9% above 2014, according to data from mergermarket, which tracks deals.\n\nthe marriage of baxalta and shire will create a portfolio that reaches into more than 100 countries, and is expected to result in over $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020, the companies said.\n\ntogether, we will have leadership positions in multiple, high-value franchises and become the clear partner of choice in rare diseases, shire ceo flemming ornskov said.\n\nunder the agreement, baxalta shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 of shire's u.s. listed stock for each baxalta share, the companies said monday. based on shire's closing price on january 8, 2016, the deal implies a value of $45.57 per baxalta share, or a 37.5% increase to the value of baxalta's shares as of august 3, 2015 — one day prior to shire's initial public offer for baxalta.\n\nthe transaction will give shareholders of bannockburn, ill.-based baxalta roughly 34% ownership in the combined company. the deal is expected to close in mid-2016.\n\nfollow usa today reporter kaja whitehouse on twitter @kajawhitehouse
holly meyer and jordan buie\n\nthe tennessean\n\nnashville — tennessee freemasons overwhelmingly voted thursday to uphold a ban on gay members, according to freemasons who witnessed the vote at a members-only meeting here.\n\ntwo freemasons confirmed the results to the tennessean but asked for anonymity because business conducted at the meetings is secret, and revealing information discussed at a meeting could result in them being kicked out of the organization. the vote took place at the grand lodge of tennessee in downtown nashville.\n\nspokesmen for the grand lodge of tennessee free & accepted masons did not return a request for comment. the organization has about 41,000 members in tennessee and more than 300 lodges across the state, according to the grand lodge's website.\n\nwhile the organization is secretive, bans on allowing gay men to participate in tennessee and georgia have prompted public discussion locally and globally, christopher hodapp, the author of freemasons for dummies, said in a thursday blog post.\n\nchurch asks boy scouts to leave over gay rights\n\ngrand masters nationally and internationally have weighed in on the debate, and california and district of columbia, grand lodges have suspended masonic relations with georgia and tennessee because of it.\n\nin the fall, the grand lodge of tennessee suspended two memphis freemasons, dennis clark and mark henderson, who had married in june after the u.s. supreme court decision legalizing gay marriage, according to hodapp's blog. a handful of nashville freemasons have withdrawn from tennessee chapters to speak out for the two men.\n\ni'm not gay myself, but i have friends who are, chase geiser of nashville said monday. i don't think this is right, and it is something that will prevent younger members from joining the organization that has seen decreasing numbers since world war ii.\n\ngeiser, a 25-year-old freemason who joined the order in 2011 and became a full member in 2012, said the grand lodges of georgia and tennessee have drawn particular criticism for their bylaws banning homosexual members.\n\nin the freemasons, geiser said, each state's grand lodge has its own constitutions and bylaws, separate from others nationally and internationally. in the united states, most masonic lodges are male only but have sister organizations such as the order of the eastern star.\n\nsuspension of the two memphis freemasons has cast light on a broader cultural issue within the freemasons, geiser said.\n\nthe organization saw a spike in membership following world war ii, and then a large falloff in the baby boomer generation. now, he said many young men are looking to align themselves with socially conscious fraternal organizations.\n\nsome are looking to find a home among freemasons, and what geiser called the old guard and the new members have differences of opinion.\n\nnigeria bans gay marriage, gay meetings\n\nthere's this cultural and ideological divide, he said. now, we are at 25% of the membership just after world war ii. the average mason in tennessee is a 69-year-old man.\n\nthe older masons have very conservative christian values, he said. the younger masons are theistic. we believe in a creator, but we don't have a problem with homosexual marriage.\n\nfollow holly meyer and jordan buie on twitter: @hollyameyer and @jordanbuie
washington — eager to please the young leader of a promising potential ally in the middle east, the cia enlisted the help of billionaire howard hughes's longtime fixer to find women for jordan's king hussein, according to documents recently made public.\n\nthat help for hussein during his spring 1959 trip to the united states, newly released documents from the investigation into the assassination of president john f. kennedy show, likely turned into a relationship between hussein and b-movie actress susan cabot that may have produced the son who eventually beat cabot to death in 1986.\n\na cia memo released dec. 15 shows how the agency used private investigator robert maheu, a former fbi agent, to find female companionship for the 23-year-old king during his trip to los angeles in april 1959.\n\nthe document refers only to a foreign head of state but the timeline included in the memo corresponds to the times hussein was in the united states. a march 28, 1959, new york times story laid out hussein's itinerary and plans to increase u.s. aid to his nation.\n\nthe foreign official was especially desirous of female companionship during his los angeles visit and it was requested that appropriate arrangements be made through a controlled source of the [cia's] office [of security] in order to assure a satisfied visit, said the anonymously written memo.\n\nthe agency turned to maheu, a private investigator in los angeles, to line up the dates, the cia memo said. maheu then contacted a prominent los angeles attorney and hollywood figure whose name was redacted in the report.\n\nan april 9, 1959, story in the los angeles times said cabot and hussein met a party at the house of california oilman edwin pauley, a longtime democratic party donor for whom ucla's basketball arena, pauley pavilion, is named.\n\non to new york\n\ncabot and hussein got along so well during the los angeles portion of his trip that he wished to meet with her during his stay in new york city from 14 through 18 april 1969, the cia memo said.\n\nthe agency, the memo said, rented a house in long beach, long island, n.y., for the time hussein was in new york, while cabot was registered at the hotel barclay in new york under an assumed name.\n\nhussein's budding relationship with cabot was well known at the time, and numerous news reports mentioned that the jewish heritage of cabot, born harriet shapiro, might cause a problem for the muslim king.\n\nduring the stay at the long beach site, [cabot] discussed the publicity in the case at some length with the security representatives, the cia memo said. she speculated about the possible sources of certain personal information that she felt had been leaked to the press.\n\ncabot's film career started in 1947 with an uncredited appearance in the film noir kiss of death and continued throughout the 1950s with roles in low-budget science fiction films such as war of the satellites and the wasp woman.\n\njordan's mission\n\nin 1959, hussein had been jordan's king for almost six years. he assumed the throne of the hashemite kingdom in 1953 after his father, talal, was forced to abdicate because of illness. at 17, hussein had witnessed the assassination of his grandfather, king abdullah i, in jerusalem.\n\nonce a british colony, jordan lost british military and economic aid in 1957 when the united kingdom cut off its annual subsidy. hussein came to united states in 1959 to ensure the continued flow of u.s. aid to his country.\n\nthe united states officials were impressed by the king's personality, the new york times reported on march 28, 1959. they discussed the possibility that in time he might develop into an arab leader comparable to his grandfather.\n\nhussein led jordan until february 1999, when he died from cancer. he was married four times, and his son from his second marriage, abdullah, succeeded him as king.\n\na brutal murder\n\ncabot was beaten to death in los angeles home on dec. 10, 1986, and her son, timothy scott roman, was charged with her murder.\n\nduring roman's 1989 trial, his defense attorney chester leo smith introduced evidence that showed the cabot received a regular sum of $1,500 a month from the keeper of the king's purse, amman, jordan. there is written indication in the handwriting of susan roman this money is from a trust. ... for better or worse, it looks like child support, smith wrote.\n\nthe jordanian government, the los angeles times reported on april 13, 1989, had no comment on smith's claims about roman's paternity.\n\nroman, the times reported on oct. 11, 1989, was born a dwarf but had grown to the height of 5 feet, 4 inches through thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary glands of cadavers. a former attorney once called him a 'failed human experiment.'\n\nhe was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, not premeditated murder, for bludgeoning his mother to death with a barbell.\n\nthe hughes-mafia-castro connection\n\nhussein had nothing to do with the nov. 22, 1963, kennedy assassination, but various government agencies had investigated the theory that cuban dictator fidel castro or the mafia were involved in kennedy's killing. that's because kennedy, along with his brother, attorney general robert kennedy, were actively trying to assassinate castro in the early 1960s.\n\none assassination plan involved the cia's use of maheu to recruit someone 'tough enough' to handle the job, reported the senate's church committee in 1976. a former fbi associate of maheu's was employed in the cia's office of security and had arranged for the cia to use maheu in several sensitive covert operations in which 'he didn't want to have an agency person or a government person get caught,' the church report said.\n\nmaheu contacted johnny rosselli, a mafioso with connections in las vegas, to handle the job along with sam giancana, a chicago-based mafia leader also active in las vegas. while rosselli was reluctant to handle the job, he and maheu eventually met with a cia official at new york's plaza hotel in september 1960 to handle the details.\n\nmaheu was also reluctant to pursue the plot, because he feared it would conflict with his new client, the reclusive billionaire howard hughes, who also had major business interests in las vegas. he finally agreed to participate because he felt that he owed the agency a commitment, the church report said.\n\nan investigation by a house committee in 1976 mentioned maheu's procurement of women for hussein, but it did not mention any specific women.\n\nthe jfk files\n\nthe cia's maheu memo was part of an unveiling of more than 35,500 documents related to the jfk investigation that were required to be released under the provisions of the president john f. kennedy assassination records collection act of 1992. many had nothing to do with the actual assassination but with people, agencies and countries implicated in the various investigations of the killing and related conspiracy theories.\n\npresident trump said he would release all of the documents without redactions, but fbi and cia officials prevailed upon him to keep some still secret or to release others with key details blacked out.\n\nany information that is still redacted is subject to trump's review and could be released in full in the coming months, the national archives said.\n\nmore:jfk files: soviet defector told how kgb compromised americans living in soviet union\n\nmore:jfk files: house assassinations committee was suspicious of defector's

bob mcmanaman\n\nusa today sports\n\navondale, ariz. -- aside from recovering from a particularly nasty concussion and learning more about his craft from outside a race car, something else happened to dale earnhardt jr. during his time away from work.\n\nnascar's peter pan decided it finally was time to grow up.\n\ni'm 42 years old, earnhardt told azcentral sports tuesday. i can't be a kid forever.\n\nearnhardt, who was cleared by doctors to get back in the car after a stint at darlington raceway in december, was speaking between testing runs at phoenix international raceway in his no. 88 chevrolet. he said it was his marriage to longtime girlfriend amy reimann on new year's eve that made him see the light.\n\nactually, amy made him see it. she's changed his life, he said.\n\nshe just helped me mature as a person, earnhardt said. she showed me a lot of things that were important. she helped me sort some priorities out in my life and get some things in a row.\n\ni've still got a lot to learn, a lot of growing to do, but she's a big part of that. she's helped me accelerate my maturity and i really needed it. i had a lot of things that i needed to get to doing better.\n\nearnhardt didn't wish to elaborate other than to say, nobody's perfect.\n\nmore nascar coverage:\n\npir unveils $178 million facelift\n\njeff gordon: alex bowman should be first call if hendrick needs a sub\n\nthere's still plenty of youthfulness in the jovial junior, who is getting ready to embark on his 19th nascar cup season after sitting out half of the 2016 campaign while suffering from issues related to his concussion.\n\nhe keeps adding, for instance, new attractions to his 200-acre spread in mooresville, n.c., which already includes an entire western town, a dirt go-kart track, a 66,000-square-foot race shop, a freshly built luxury treehouse and a massive race car graveyard.\n\nbut as his driving career winds down, there's no mistaking that earnhardt is making it his business to be more dutiful to the business. that's why he isn't whining during his two days of testing here, something he's disliked to do anywhere. it's also why he didn't overreact to the small brake fire in his car tuesday morning.\n\nafter being forced to sit out for the longest time during a cup career that began in 1999, earnhardt absolutely was giddy to get behind the wheel for his first real action on a track. oh sure, he took a few laps at darlington raceway to meet doctors' approval, but this was different. you could tell by the country-wide smile on his red-bearded face.\n\nit's great to be able to get on the track some, run some laps before the season starts, get to work with my guys again and kind of get in the groove, he said. it's been a real good day so far and i'm looking forward to the season getting going. we've only got a few more weeks before we get after it big time (at daytona).\n\nhe plans to return at daytona international speedway in the daytona 500 on feb. 26 (fox, 2 p.m. et) for his first points-paying cup race since early july.\n\nasked if it was an emotional moment or just another day at the track, earnhardt said, no, not really. actually, i was just super happy, probably more so than usual. the guys were pumped. the day's been going well, we're learning some stuff and we've had good speed. … the car feels good and i felt great in the car.\n\ndealing with ongoing concussion symptoms didn't feel great at all. it's been a long road back, earnhardt said, and he used the time between the fog and the headaches to consider his future. and not just retirement.\n\nyeah, you contemplate everything, earnhardt said. you've got to do what's right for your health and your body and make the best decision you can for yourself. it affects a lot more people than just you, though. you've got to make the right decision that's going to be right for the long haul.\n\none thing that helped was attending an october race at dover, del., where he watched from the pit box as four-time cup champion jeff gordon, who had retired from racing in 2015, filled in behind the wheel. alex bowman split time with gordon as earnhardt's replacement drivers. watching that particular race in dover, however, was an out-of-body experience to earnhardt.\n\nit just really gave me a unique perspective on just being a fan and being a pair of eyes in the garage, getting out of the suit and seeing it from that vantage point and watching everybody operate, he said. it was just really impressive. you can't see that when you're actually in there doing it, when you're in the middle of it. you just can't really see how everything is moving all along, so i enjoyed it. it was fun.\n\nmore nascar coverage:\n\njames: dale earnhardt jr.

much effort to keep up with the schedule and be away from home for so long.\n\ni guess you show up and don't enjoy it one day, i don't know, he said. there's been a lot of races where we didn't end up where we wanted to and weren't that fun because of circumstances. but you're never just generally in the car not having fun, not enjoying it. once that starts happening, i think you've got to think about doing something else.\n\nthere's always that humongous, fun treehouse in mooresville if the former peter pan of nascar wants to be a kid again for a spell. that, or he can just drive through the

fun. it never gets old riding around looking at some of that stuff, earnhardt said. you always see something new. there's probably 60 to 80 out there in the woods on about 70 acres. the treehouse is great, though. it's hard to beat that treehouse. i spent the night before my wedding up there by myself.\n\nperfect place to be the day before a kid becomes a man.\n\nmcmanaman writes for the arizona

recommendations are independently chosen by reviewed's editors. purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nwhen melissa dalgleish got married in 2014, she and her then-fiance decided to get a prenup. during her first marriage, dalgleish and her ex-husband were poor grad students with practically no assets to split. with her second go-round, it was a different story.\n\nher husband had inherited his family home, which they lived in. however, dalgleish was the breadwinner while her spouse was a stay-at-home dad who didn't rake in any income.\n\nit was important to both of us that, if we divorced, we already had a plan in place to ensure an equitable division of family assets that wouldn't require us to sell the house to pay me out, says dalgleish, who is 38 and a research manager based out of ontario, canada. but i also wanted the prenuptial to reflect the fact that i'm the primary breadwinner, and have contributed substantially to the increased value of the house and our investments.\n\nadvertisement\n\nif you're about to get hitched, a prenuptial agreement, or a legal contract that lays out the property rights of each partner in a marriage when it ends, is more common than you think. according to a 2018 survey of matrimonial lawyers, more millennials are getting prenups than before. in fact, 62% of lawyers have seen a jump in a short three years.\n\nhere are several reasons, with some insight from legal pros, why you might consider getting a prenup.\n\n1. protection from debt\n\ncredit: getty images / drazen_ those with student, medical, or credit card debt may want to consider a prenup before marriage.\n\nif either party is bringing debt into the marriage, you may want to clearly spell out who is responsible for that debt. a prenup can protect the other partner from any credit card debt, student loans, medical debt, and so forth.\n\n2. you've been married before\n\nif you have kids from a previous marriage, you might want to get a prenup to define which assets you want to pass on to your children should you die. in some cases, a prenup can actually reinforce what's in a will, and can define more specifically how to divide the assets that belonged to each party before they entered the marriage, or which heir will receive it.\n\nif you go without a prenup, the assets you had before the marriage and after the marriage could be lumped together and treated the same. your spouse might have the right to the majority, which could in turn lead to a lot less for your kids.\n\nadvertisement\n\n3. you or your partner might get a big raise\n\nyou may anticipate that one or both partners in the soon-to-be marriage will increase their wealth significantly. for instance, maybe one partner is in school to become a lawyer or doctor, and is banking on a major bump in income after he or she lands a job. or, perhaps you or your spouse expect to receive a generous windfall due to an inheritance.\n\nfor instance, maybe one partner is in school to become a lawyer or doctor, and anticipates a major bump in income after he or she lands a job.\n\nwhatever the case might be, it might be a good idea to explore a prenup agreement. for some couples, the motivation for a prenup is a belief that one or both parties will substantially increase their wealth through entrepreneurial endeavors during the marriage, says emily pollock, partner in the matrimonial and family law department at kasowitz benson torres llp. and they want to define to what extent their spouse may share in that increase.\n\n4. you already share assets\n\nif you bought a house or car together, you might want to talk to a lawyer—even if you don't think a prenup is for you. that way, you'll know your property rights and how your assets will be split. depending on what you learn, you may want to spell out—or potentially expand—those rights, explains kelly frawley, partner in the matrimonial and family law department at kasowitz benson torres llp.\n\nadvertisement\n\nas far as assets in a marriage go, there's common law property and community property. note that depending on where you live and the type of asset, the property might be handled and divided differently. in a nutshell:\n\nif you live in a common law state, ownership is typically linked to whose name is formally listed as the owner on the document.\n\nin a community property state, everything you earn or acquire together during a marriage is considered community property. and assets you had before the marriage and brought into the marriage are considered separate property.\n\nit could get a little tricky if, say, you opened a joint bank account. a prenup can define who owns how much of that money before the marriage as well as who owns money deposited from cash gifts, work bonuses, and side hustle income during the marriage. talking to a lawyer and getting a prenup can help avoid confusion.\n\n5. you have a business together\n\ncredit: getty images / tijana simic if you or your partner own a business, a prenup can cover a lot of financial bases.\n\nif you're co-owners of a business, a prenup can do a lot of things: it can help define the value of the business at the time of marriage, and if your spouse will share in your business's profits and losses. it can also outline specifics on how your income can be managed and distributed. and should you divorce or there's a death, a prenup can spell out exactly how much of your shared business you will be entitled to.\n\nadvertisement\n\neven if you have solo ventures, a prenup can establish the same details on how the income, property, and other assets will be dealt with.\n\n6. you own a pet\n\nwhile you probably see your pet as a member of the family, under the law they are considered property. a prenup can spell out who is responsible for the animal in the event of a separation.\n\nclarifying pet ownership is less common, but it does happen and if it is an important concern, it can save parties a lot of litigation cost in the event that there is a dispute as to with which party the pet will reside after divorce, says frawley.\n\n7. your parents got divorced\n\nsometimes your reasoning may be more personal than it is financially driven. in other words, you've witnessed firsthand a long, drawn-out, complicated divorce—perhaps with your parents.\n\nadvertisement\n\nbesides any confusion that might come with who gets what, you might want to set clear expectations and obligations to curb the duration and litigation costs of a potential breakup, says pollock.\n\n8. it could save you money\n\nthe average cost of drafting a prenup, according to data from avvo, is typically anywhere from $800 to $2,500. it largely depends on how complex your situation is, and can cost up to $10,000. however, if you forgo this early step, the legal fees—plus any assets you might not have had to divvy up or part with if you had a prenup in place—could be far higher. the average cost of getting divorced in the u.s. is $12,900, and it typically takes a year to dissolve a marriage.\n\nwhat happens if you don't get a prenup?\n\ncredit: getty images / adene_sanchez not everyone needs a prenup—but you should understand where things stand without one.\n\nso, does everyone need a prenup? not necessarily. but everyone should understand what their rights and obligations would be without one, pollock says.\n\nyour property rights and determining who owns which assets will unfold according to the laws in your state. as we mentioned, if you live in a common law state, whoever owns that piece of property, earns that income, receives that inheritance, and so forth on paper is the rightful owner. so if that debt is under your name, you are responsible for paying it off.\n\nif you live in a common law state, whoever owns that piece of property, earns that income, receives that inheritance on paper is the rightful owner.\n\nif you live in a community property state, ownership of assets is a bit trickier. income and property bought with that income is shared. should you divorce, your assets will be split evenly, but only the assets you acquired together while married.\n\ndebt incurred during the marriage is also shared, but not everything falls under this category: gifts, inheritances, and property owned before entering the union are considered separate. so should one partner have debt, the lender can actually go after your joint assets and income, no matter whose debt that is.\n\nbefore you make a final decision, consider getting some professional legal advice to see what path best suits your situation.\n\nafter each party has consulted with a matrimonial and family law attorney to learn the applicable law, a couple may decide that how the law would be applied in the absence of a prenup makes sense and is fair, frawley explains.\n\nor they may decide that they want to specify and guarantee how certain issues or assets and liabilities will be addressed in the event of a divorce and move forward with a prenuptial agreement, which will require that each party retain their own counsel to help in drafting and executing the agreement.
robert bianco\n\nusa today\n\nso many paths, so little time.\n\nwhatever you may think of the quality of tv shows these days, there's no debating their abundance: week after week, hour after hour, on outlet after outlet, new series arrive. lines must be drawn, which means that despite a trio of top stars — aaron paul, hugh dancy and michelle monaghan — and an admirably unusual premise, hulu's the path (wednesday, ** ½ out of four) simply may not be one you want to follow.\n\nthe path, created by jessica goldberg, explores the communal lives and faith of the followers of meyerism — a made-up religion that seems to be a combination of scientology, est and new age veganism. living together on a compound, these meyerists are both intensely private and intensely committed, shunning publicity as they follow the ladder toward the light.\n\nbut change is in the wind. the religion's founding father is in peru and out of touch, leaving day-to-day operations in the hands of cal (dancy), who thinks meyerism needs to stop hiding its light under a bushel.\n\nthat switch does not sit well with sarah (monaghan), but she has more immediate problems. her husband, eddie (paul), has returned from peru troubled and distant — the result, she thinks, of a sexual affair. the truth, which eddie keeps to himself, is that something has rocked his faith.\n\naaron paul loses his religion in hulu's 'the path'\n\nhulu forges 'path' to a cult phenomenon\n\nthere are interesting questions here, including how we decide what we're willing to embrace (or at least accord grudging respect) as a religion and what we dismiss as a cult. and respect is the watchword here: while we're clearly meant to see worrisome aspects in meyerism — led by the use of force to retain straying members — it's just as clear that we're not meant to mock its followers. there are, after all, worse sins in life than being painfully earnest.\n\nin tv, however, there are few worse sins than being uninvolving — and despite the best efforts of a strong cast, that's where the path lands. lives and happiness are at stake here, yet the dramatic stakes somehow linger between low and medium. monaghan's sarah is a blind zealot; paul's eddie is a liar who allows his wife to suffer under the belief that he has been unfaithful rather then admit he's questioning his faith. no matter how much these two lovely people love each other, this is not a marriage we're left crying out to see saved.\n\nworse yet for the show's dramatic purposes, the belief system they're battling over is so indistinct that it barely exists. the cult emerges as a hazy, marijuana-drenched mix of dated clichés, kept vague, perhaps, to avoid offense to any particular group. we're meant to be moved by the power of faith rather than faith itself, but that's a fine line for a series that gives us too little of substance or interest to hang on to otherwise.\n\non the plus side, hulu is giving you only two hour-long episodes wednesday, with the other eight to follow on a weekly basis. that limited commitment leaves you a week to decide whether you want to return.\n\ni wouldn't, but hey: your time; your path.
salina, kan. – albert bert and carol stevenson met later in life, after previous marriages that happened years before, at a kansas restaurant in 2009. the couple loved to camp and go on their pontoon across the lake.\n\nthey said they were just going to date, then my dad ended up moving into the house with her, said bert's daughter sharolyn hoffman, of salina, kansas.\n\nthey said they were too old to get married, and one day they called me and told me they were getting married. i thought they were joking, hoffman said. turns out they were not.\n\nthe couple both tested positive for the coronavirus at the end of december and started out the new year battling the virus.\n\nafter nearly two weeks of several ups and downs, they died less than two hours apart while holding each other's hands in bed at the salina regional health center.\n\nbefore marriage\n\nbert, who had two marriages before finding carol, met her when he was starting to accept that his alzheimer's disease was going to have a major effect on his life.\n\nbert was a recovered alcoholic for 39 years, who helped with aa meetings in salina and was a mentor to a lot of people, said nicke stevenson, bert's daughter-in-law. when you asked him how he was doing, he would say 'better than i deserve' every time.\n\ncarol also had two previous marriages. she has two daughters, both of whom live in the seattle area.\n\nmy mother was living in the moment, very strong, super sweet, probably the nicest person i ever met, said pennie pickering. she outlived her first two husbands, and was a caretaker for both husbands. she really had a reputation of being a caretaker. she always had children in her life. she has always been a mother or grandmother and is the favorite aunt to a lot family.\n\ntogether, the couple has more than a dozen grandchildren, and carol has several great-grandchildren.\n\nwhen they were first dating, i was visiting my mother for a couple of weeks, said carol's daughter jody lentz. she was telling me that bert was really nervous to meet me and i told her that was kind of funny as i was a little nervous to meet him for the first time.\n\nthe wedding day\n\nthe couple married on june 30, 2012, on a warm summer day at carol's homestead near kanopolis lake in kansas. carol was 72, while bert was 69.\n\nbert, who sings exactly like elvis presley, sang elvis' hawaiian wedding song, which was in the film blue hawaii.\n\nbert always loved to sing elvis songs, he was good at it, hoffman said. we had a big shindig for them. carol's family came from washington, it was hotter than donut glaze, but it was a great time.\n\nshelli redden, bert's daughter, remembers the love and compassion they had for one another.\n\nhe (bert) would have never let us kids take care of him, especially when he got further into having his alzheimer's, she said. carol saved his life, because he allowed her into his life and let her take care of him. he was able to do things that he would not have been able to do if he did not have his partner with him. she loved him unconditionally, she knew what she was getting into.\n\nredden said family members asked her several times if she wanted to marry bert, not because we did not want her to marry him, but because she was marrying a man who was struggling with this disease and we knew it was going to be hard.\n\nfamily members knew his alzheimer's was not going to get any better, but carol went into it with her eyes wide open, redden said.\n\nwhen you were around them, you knew they were in love. the smiles on their faces, the way they treated each other and took care of each other, redden said. carol really brought all of us back together.\n\nvoices:we were cautious. and yet, somehow, my entire household got covid-19.\n\ntraveling to see family and dancing to elvis\n\na favorite pastime of bert and carol's was to travel and see family, so much so they bought a motorhome to help accommodate their travel. most of the time, their designations were not tourist attractions, but where they had family they could visit.\n\nwe have family in seven states and all over the country. their fun pastime was going out with family. she (was) constantly doing things with family, they were going to events. they traveled out here to come see us, said pickering.\n\nit did not matter which restaurant or what environment they were in. if elvis was playing, they would always get up and dance. sometimes they would be the only ones dancing, but they were fun to watch, said lentz.\n\nhow they got covid-19\n\nthe couple went to a family christmas eve gathering, and on dec. 26th they were diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nmy mother knew of the risk, but she could not help herself. she had to give presents, pickering said. christmas is a big deal for her to see family. they were literally 30 days from being vaccinated and they had made it since early march of quarantining. ... they were in the high age-risk group, with a few prior medical issues.\n\npickering said carol was warned by several family members that it was not a good idea to go to a family gathering for the holidays, but she went.\n\ntheir fight together\n\nafter testing positive for the virus, the couple both had their good days and their bad days in fighting the virus.\n\ncarol's blood pressure started going up, said bert's daughter-in-law, nicke stevenson. both of them went to the er together and both of them got released from the hospital. new year's eve, we thought they were doing pretty good.\n\ndoug and nicke stevenson gave them as much care as they possibly could.\n\nit was a rollercoaster ride for the past two weeks. they went to the hospital three times. the staff at the salina regional health center did a phenomenal job. there were three or four individuals working there that i cannot thank enough. we had a lot of ups and downs, doug stevenson said.\n\nbert was sedated for three days with covid-19. the virus made his alzheimer's worse.\n\ndad with the alzheimer's did not know who we were. he had lost his awareness of who we were, but i think he knew we belonged to him, said redden.\n\nthere were over 100 people in our text chain when they were sick, said pickering.\n\nafter fighting for a week and a half, the couple died within two hours of each other while holding hands at the hospital – on elvis presley's birthday, jan. 8.\n\ni talked to her the night before, they talked about putting her on a ventilator. they both loved elvis presley. it is sad, but the way they went was really good, said jan lytle, a niece-in-law to bert.\n\nredden decided to play music on her phone in the last few hours with the couple.\n\nthey wanted to go out of the world together and they were able to. it was devastating, but at least they were together, she said.\n\ncarol died when the song stand by me by ben e. king played, less than two hours before bert.\n\nwe were all in the same room as they were holding hands. dad passed away to a song of elvis, 'my way,' which was another poignant moment for us. even though we were not ready for them to go, they both went out on their own songs and on their own way, said redden.\n\nthere were lots of tears, nurses were crying with us. the nurses were amazing, they helped us every step of the way.\n\nthe family is planning on having a celebration for bert and carol on the fourth of july weekend.\n\nwe have family in seven states and all over the country, pickering said.\n\nmy dad always said he did not want a funeral, he wanted a party, said redden. they both loved to sing and dance. we cannot do it now; we hope by july things will be safe and we can gather together with family and friends.\n\nfollow the salina journal on

for the record\n\ntwo republicans, somewhat alike in dignity, in fair washington, where we lay our scene. a pair of star-cross'd politicians met in real life, who hope to with their meeting bury their party's strife.\n\ndonald trump and paul ryan met thursday. it was dramatic. shakespearan, even. and like two of the bard's characters of yore, trump and ryan pledged their undying devotion (to work together for republicans this fall).\n\nhere are all the theatrics in today's for the record, the politics newsletter from usa today.\n\ntrump and ryan are now seeing each other; ryan does not dtr\n\nas we previewed yesterday, trump and ryan swiped right (though not too far right) and met up to see see if they had any connection.\n\nat stake: the unity of the republican party, perhaps, should trump become president and ryan remain house speaker. the result: it's complicated.\n\nwe're off to a very good start, said ryan, who added that he and trump plan on seeing each other again. but ryan still hasn't formally endorsed trump, making this whole thing feel more like an arranged marriage.\n\nover the course of 45 minutes, trump and ryan chatted about free trade, immigration, party unity and probably their hobbies. reince priebus, dad of the gop, chaperoned the whole thing (ugh, so embarrassing) but the republican national chairman issued his approval:\n\nthe meeting was great, priebus tweeted. #prouddad\n\nthis is the real life. it's not just fantasy.\n\nwe've watched the nation move through the five stages of grief since trump closed in on the gop, from denial to anger and bargaining to depression. now, one step remains: acceptance.\n\ncue lindsey graham, the gop senator who once likened a trump nomination to being shot or poisoned.\n\ngraham spoke with trump wednesday, he said, calling the conversation cordial and pleasant. and while graham congratulated trump on becoming the face of the gop, graham still says he won't vote for him.\n\nalso not endorsing trump: george h.w. bush. but bush's former v.p.? sure, why not.\n\ndan quayle praised trump on the today show thursday, claiming he is more qualified to be president than hillary clinton because voters' main qualification is that a candidate not be qualified to be president. makes sense, actually.\n\nbernie sanders' plan for new jersey: get a 28-year-old to run for sheriff\n\nwith only a narrow path to the nomination (by his words, not ours), bernie sanders is still hustling in early states and picking up some primary wins. his real goal: to beef up his delegate count, giving him more sway to shape his party's platform at the democratic convention this summer.\n\nhe looks now to the june 7 primary in new jersey, a state whose wacky ballot system requires sanders to get a 28-year-old guy named alex to run for sheriff. alex doesn't want to be a sheriff. alex doesn't think he'll be a sheriff. but such is this convoluted process we call democracy.\n\nmore from the campaign trail\n\nget ready for (one, maybe two?) decades of constant ted cruz burns\n\nmemo to ted cruz: you may be out of the 2016 race. you may be back to running for senate. but you'll never be free from the scorn of john boehner. he's retired, has plenty of free time, and seems committed to publicly insulting you at every opportunity for the rest of his days.
lisa bitel\n\npri.org\n\nvalentine's day originated as a liturgical feast to celebrate the decapitation of a third-century christian martyr, or perhaps two. so, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on valentine's day?\n\nearly origins of st. valentine\n\nancient sources reveal that there were several st. valentines who died on feb. 14. two of them were executed during the reign of roman emperor claudius gothicus in 269-270 a.d., at a time when persecution of christians was common.\n\nhow do we know this? because an order of belgian monks spent three centuries collecting evidence for the lives of saints from manuscript archives around the known world.\n\nthey were called bollandists after jean bolland, a jesuit scholar who began publishing the massive 68-folio volumes of acta sanctorum, or lives of the saints, beginning in 1643.\n\nsince then, successive generations of monks continued the work until the last volume was published in 1940. the brothers dug up every scrap of information about every saint on the liturgical calendar and printed the texts arranged according to the saint's feast day.\n\nthe valentine martyrs\n\nthe volume encompassing feb. 14 contains the stories of a handful of valentini, including the earliest three of whom died in the third century.\n\nthe earliest valentinus is said to have died in africa, along with 24 soldiers. unfortunately, even the bollandists could not find any more information about him. as the monks knew, sometimes all that the saints left behind was a name and day of death.\n\nwe know only a little more about the other two valentines.\n\naccording to a late medieval legend reprinted in the acta, which was accompanied by bollandist critique about its historical value, a roman priest named valentinus was arrested during the reign of emperor gothicus and put into the custody of an aristocrat named asterius.\n\nas the story goes, asterius made the mistake of letting the preacher talk. father valentinus went on and on about christ leading pagansout of the shadow of darkness and into the light of truth and salvation. asterius made a bargain with valentinus: if the christian could cure asterius's foster-daughter of blindness, he would convert. valentinus put his hands over the girl's eyes and chanted:\n\nlord jesus christ, en-lighten your handmaid, because you are god, the true light.\n\neasy as that. the child could see, according to the medieval legend. asterius and his whole family were baptized. unfortunately, when emperor gothicus heard the news, he ordered them all to be executed. but valentinus was the only one to be beheaded. a pious widow, though, made off with his body and had it buried at the site of his martyrdom on the via flaminia, the ancient highway stretching from rome to present-day rimini. later, a chapel was built over the saint's remains.\n\nst. valentine was not a romantic\n\nthe third third-century valentinus was a bishop of terni in the province of umbria, italy.\n\naccording to his equally dodgy legend, terni's bishop got into a situation like the other valentinus by debating a potential convert and afterward healing his son. the rest of story is quite similar as well: he too was beheaded on the orders of emperor gothicus and his body buried along the via flaminia.\n\nit is likely, as the bollandists suggested, that there weren't actually two decapitated valentines, but that two different versions of one saint's legend appeared in both rome and terni.\n\nnonetheless, african, roman or umbrian, none of the valentines seems to have been a romantic.\n\nindeed, medieval legends, repeated in modern media, had st. valentine performing christian marriage rituals or passing notes between christian lovers jailed by gothicus. still other stories romantically involved him with the blind girl whom he allegedly healed. yet none of these medieval tales had any basis in third-century history, as the bollandists pointed out.\n\nin any case, historical veracity did not count for much with medieval christians. what they cared about were stories of miracles and martyrdoms and the physical remains or relics of the saint. to be sure, many different churches and monasteries around medieval europe claimed to have bits of a st. valentinus' skull in their treasuries.\n\nsanta maria in cosmedin in rome, for example, still displays a whole skull. according to the bollandists, other churches across europe also claim to own slivers and bits of one or the other st. valentinus' body: for example, san anton church in madrid, whitefriar street church in dublin, the church of sts. peter and paul in prague, saint mary's assumption in chelmno, poland, as well as churches in malta, birmingham, glasgow, and on the greek isle of lesbos, among others.\n\nfor believers, relics of the martyrs signified the saints' continuing their invisible presence among communities of pious christians. in 11th-century brittany, for instance, one bishop used what was purported to be valentine's head to halt fires, prevent epidemics and cure all sorts of illnesses, including demonic possession.\n\nas far as we know, though, the saint's bones did nothing special for lovers.\n\nunlikely pagan origins\n\nmany scholars have deconstructed valentine and his day in books, articles and blog postings. some suggest that the modern holiday is a christian cover-up of the more ancient roman celebration of lupercalia in mid-february.\n\nlupercalia originated as a ritual in a rural masculine cult involving the sacrifice of goats and dogs and evolved later into an urban carnival. during the festivities half-naked young men ran through the streets of rome, streaking people with thongs cut from the skins of newly killed goats. pregnant women thought it brought them healthy babies. in 496 a.d., however, pope gelasius supposedly denounced the rowdy festival.\n\nstill, there is no evidence that the pope purposely replaced lupercalia with the more sedate cult of the martyred st. valentine or any other christian celebration.\n\nchaucer and the love birds\n\nthe love connection probably appeared more than a thousand years after the martyrs' death, when geoffrey chaucer, author of the canterbury tales decreed the february feast of st. valentinus to the mating of birds. he wrote in his parlement of foules:\n\nfor this was on seynt volantynys day. whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make.\n\nit seems that, in chaucer's day, english birds paired off to produce eggs in february. soon, nature-minded european nobility began sending love notes during bird-mating season. for example, the french duke of orléans, who spent some years as a prisoner in the tower of london, wrote to his wife in february 1415 that he was already sick of love — by which he meant lovesick. and he called her his very gentle valentine.\n\nenglish audiences embraced the idea of february mating. shakespeare's lovestruck ophelia spoke of herself as hamlet's valentine.\n\nin the following centuries, englishmen and women began using feb. 14 as an excuse to pen verses to their love objects. industrialization made it easier with mass-produced illustrated cards adorned with smarmy poetry. then along came cadbury, hershey's, and other chocolate manufacturers marketing sweets for one's sweetheart on valentine's day.\n\ntoday, shops everywhere in england and the us decorate their windows with hearts and banners proclaiming the annual day of love. merchants stock their shelves with candy, jewelry and cupid-related trinkets begging be my valentine. for most lovers, this request does not require beheading.\n\ninvisible valentines\n\nit seems that the erstwhile saint behind the holiday of love remains as elusive as love itself. still, as st. augustine, the great fifth-century theologian and philosopher argued in his treatise on faith in invisible things, someone does not have to be standing before our eyes for us to love them.\n\nand much like love itself, st. valentine and his reputation as the patron saint of love are not matters of verifiable history, but of faith.\n\nlisa bitel, professor of history & religion, university of southern california – dornsife college of letters, arts and sciences\n\nthis article was originally published on the conversation.

andrea mandell\n\nusa today\n\nwest hollywood, calif. – to date, a few viral karaoke videos have been the most the world has heard tom hiddleston sing.\n\nthat will change friday, when hiddleston, 35, makes his debut in the hank williams biopic i saw the light, in which he impressively adopts the country legend's distinct warble. he laughs. i apologize unreservedly for those, the british actor says on a warm day in los angeles. professionally, i haven't really sang before, he says. i mean i was in musicals (in school), but i was always a singing actor. i was never in a band, i was never in the choir or anything like that.\n\ni saw the light is full of tumult, genius and pain, chronicling the country legend's six years in infamy as williams charted 33 hit singles, until he died abruptly at the age of 29 in the backseat of a cadillac in 1953.\n\ninside tom hiddleston's very big spring\n\ni thought about this a lot, says hiddleston. you think of all of those people who burned twice as bright but not for long, like janis joplin and amy winehouse and james dean and marilyn monroe and kurt cobain and jimi hendrix. there's a club, what do they call it, the 27 club or something? heath ledger was 27.\n\nhe continues: they become canonized, because they lived at a pitch of such intensity just before the lights went out. and they become frozen in time, so there is never a moment where you see the maturation of their talent or their personality. in some respects, it's basically a tragedy because you don't know where they would have gone or how they would have developed.\n\nmore than 60 years have passed since williams' death, and classics like your cheatin' heart, i'm so lonesome i could cry and cold, cold heart still play on the radio.\n\ni saw the light, which received shaky reviews at its debut at the toronto film festival, despite applause for hiddleston's performance, charts the genesis of those songs, while folding in williams' tumultuous marriage to audrey williams (elizabeth olsen), his unreliability and the ultimately fatal mix of alcohol and drugs he used in part to control chronic pain caused by spina bifida.\n\nhiddleston, who has become beloved to marvel fans worldwide as the impish god loki, embedded himself in nashville for five weeks to get williams right.\n\nsee tom hiddleston shimmy like hank williams\n\nthere were some dark days where i just wasn't sure if i was going to get it, he admits. there was a moment where i canceled everything. i canceled my life, i didn't pick up the phone, i didn't do anything else but what was related to hank.\n\nhe puts a lot of pressure on himself with everything he does, says olsen, adding that hiddleston took on responsibility to do right by williams' legacy and family.\n\nskill-wise, director marc abraham calls hiddleston so facile it's infuriating. that means on-set instead of staying in character, the actor easily switched between dialects. let's put it this way: when we would have a disagreement about how something was coming down, he reverted to the king's english, the director laughs.\n\nnow, despite big-budget films such asthor: ragnarok and kong: skull island in the wings, it's williams who stayed with hiddleston. looking back at it, it was one of the most fulfilling things i've ever done, he says.
sandra harwitt\n\nspecial to usa today\n\nmelbourne — if history can be relied on then serena williams can count on at least reaching the australian open semifinals this year.\n\nthe 16th-seeded williams organized that possible good fortune when she defeated 79th-ranked genie bouchard of canada 6-2, 6-2 in the second round thursday.\n\nbouchard, an australian open semifinalist in 2014, has played in the main draw in melbourne on six occasions and all five previous opponents she's lost to have gone on to at least the semifinals.\n\nof course, a semifinal showing is hardly the result williams is looking for in melbourne. a 23-time grand slam champion, with an open era record of seven australian open victories, williams lives to successfully reach the finish line at every tournament she plays.\n\nwhile she understands that try as she might she can't win everything, it doesn't mean she has to love that reality.\n\ni do my best, said williams, who won her last major while pregnant at the 2017 australian open. i don't obviously win them all or i'd have, like, 80 grand slams. but i do my best to win the ones i can. obviously if i don't win, i go home. i go back to the drawing board. i see what i can do better. i come back. that's all i can do.\n\nthat's the strategy she's employing here after failing to hoist the trophy at wimbledon and the us open last year, where she lost in the finals to angelique kerber and naomi osaka, respectively.\n\nwilliams, 37, believes it's innate that she has the attitude of wanting to do it all and do it well — tennis career, small-business owner in the fashion industry, wife, mother.\n\nmore:venus williams loves her niece's qai qai doll as much as social media does\n\nmore:doll qai qai holds special place in serena williams' family\n\ni need to be busy because, like, i have so much energy, she said. i always thought the older i get, the more calm i'll get. i feel like it's kind of going opposite. i keep getting more energy. it's crazy.\n\ndisregarding fame and fortune, williams lumps herself together with the vast majority of people.\n\ni'm not doing anything special, she said. i'm just doing what i felt like working parents do, she said. they make it work. i'm just like literally everyone else. i'm making it work. it's not easy. but i have to do, as a mom and wife, what i have to do.\n\nas someone who lives to rewrite history, williams' most pressing goal at the moment is to tie the record of 24 grand slam singles trophies won by former australian margaret court.\n\nif she does accomplish the feat of tying the record here, court is not expected to be in the crowd to applaud the achievement.\n\na preacher who speaks out against homosexuality and the change of law that made same-sex marriage legal in australia, court's views are not popular in tennis circles. last year many players and fans called for the renaming of the margaret court arena here at melbourne park.\n\nin the third round, williams will play ukrainian dayana yastremska, who upset 23rd-seeded carla suarez navarro of spain, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. if she wins that match, a fourth-round encounter awaits against either venus williams or no. 1 simona halep.
corey anderson was eager to let people know that there are levels to this game.\n\ndisrespected going into the fight, anderson (13-4 mma, 10-4 ufc) had a point to prove when he was matched up with highly-touted rising star johnny walker at this past november's ufc 244. anderson, who had been continuously campaigning for a title shot, was the betting underdog going into the fight, but it wouldn't take long for him to prove his point.\n\nround 1 started with walker delivering his patented fakes and awkward movements, switching stances back and forth. anderson would eventually charge forward, grabbing walker's leg and stacking him against the cage to work for a takedown.\n\nwalker stuffed the first takedown attempt, a good early sign, but just seconds later, anderson cracked walker with a big overhand right, followed by a few shots that didn't fully connect, but ended the combination with a left hook that dropped walker to the floor.\n\nanderson made sure not to let walker off the hook, pouring it on, even as walker made his way back to his feet. he would take him right back down, dropping some more ground and pound. walker was in survival mode, stumbling all over the place, until he was met with another big right hand, and the referee stopped the fight with walker almost out on his feet.\n\nan infuriated anderson taunted his way across the cage, screaming in walker's face, and even mocking his celebratory dance. big city, bright lights, and anderson was not going to be denied.\n\nanderson returns to action this saturday in the ufc on espn+ 25 headliner in rio rancho, n.m., when he rematches jan blachowicz in what could very well be a no. 1 contender fight.\n\nanderson won their first meeting in 2015 at ufc 191 via unanimous decision, and he looks to replicate his performance on feb. 15. before then, check out the video above to watch anderson's big finish over walker.
maria puente\n\nusa today\n\ntheir wedding was spectacular, their happiness plain, and five years on, prince william and the former kate middleton are still living the blissful life.\n\nthe fifth anniversary of the nuptials watched by multiple millions around the world is friday, which seems like a good time to contemplate the state of their union — and the state of their royal brand.\n\nboth seem to be more than sound: the duke and duchess of cambridge, a future king and his queen consort, appear to be still in love and very happy together. as such they remain the most-watched members of the royal family after granny queen elizabeth ii, who just turned 90.\n\nqueen elizabeth ii marks 90th birthday on thursday\n\nonly one thing could rival the couple's dominance, says cnn royal commentator victoria arbiter, who grew up the daughter of a royal press secretary.\n\nprince harry getting married would be the only thing that could take away the attention, she jokes. (don't hold your breath: harry, 31, is too busy even to have a girlfriend lately.)\n\nbut will and kate are really important to britain, says royal biographer sally bedell smith, author of a forthcoming book on prince charles. they are the faces of the future of the monarchy in the new generation.\n\ntheir appeal is obvious: they are a young couple with two young children, and appear to be a 'normal' couple that people (in the u.k. and abroad) can relate to, says charlie proctor, editor-in-chief of royal central, a leading royal-news website in the united kingdom.\n\nthe cambridges remain incredibly popular, says charlotte crawley, who runs the british blog hrhduchesskate, a must-read for kate watchers. people who meet them find them very personable and engaging — their story has resonated globally and they have fans from all over the world. on the blog, over 50% of readers are from the u.s.\n\nduring their recent six-day state visit to india and bhutan, the pair looked to be endearingly affectionate judging from little signs: he, lightly, protectively touching her back, she, leaning in close to him to talk and laugh.\n\nthey seemed to be in a permanent state of delight as they traveled around india and the himalayan kingdom of bhutan, doing their royal thing: meeting excited well-wishers and laying wreaths, feeding baby elephants and rhinos, hiking hours up to monastery on a mountain, and posing at the taj mahal, the world's most famous monument to love.\n\nthey are clearly a couple very much in love, crawley says. they are very natural together, very much at ease, and i would say they bring out the best in each other.\n\nwill and kate's visit to taj mahal may banish sad memories of princess diana\n\nwhy does it matter? some will remember that at this point in will's parents' marriage, the relationship between prince charles and princess diana was already beginning to fray, although the public didn't know it yet.\n\nit was an entirely different story for charles and diana, as their marriage was fraught with problems and professional jealousy, crawley says. with the cambridges, it's a very successful partnership.\n\nso it's likely to be a happy anniversary for will, 33, and kate, 34. as with the previous four anniversaries, it is expected to be privately celebrated with few details released by their media team at kensington palace.\n\nfrom a royal point of view, the couple have already achieved one of their most important duties: they have produced an heir and a spare. three days after the anniversary, on may 2, their second child, princess charlotte, turns 1 year old. and on july 22, their first child and third-in-line to the throne, prince george, turns 3.\n\nexpect more pictures (many fans can't get enough) of both children, probably some by keen photographer duchess kate herself.\n\nbut even the most popular royals can't escape some criticism, and lately the cambridges have heard some, especially in the british media, about not working hard enough, not being transparent enough, blowing off some royal engagements and, worst of all, blowing off the hometown media.\n\nwill & kate set to depart for india, leaving carping critics behind\n\nsmith says the cambridges are feeling their way, trying to find a balance between their royal duty to be visible in public and their desire for as normal a life as possible for their family — in an age of 24-7 social media scrutiny. so far, smith thinks, they have handled themselves well, have not put a foot wrong as the british say.\n\nthey are trying to preserve their family life, just as then-princess elizabeth and prince philip, early in their marriage, were allowed to preserve their family life in the few years they had before she became queen, smith says.\n\nas a young mum, kate would be criticized today if she were perceived as neglecting her children for months-long overseas trips, as was routine when the queen was a young mother in the 1950s, says smith, also the author of an acclaimed biography of the queen.\n\nthey're hands-on parents, very involved in their children's lives, smith says. and everyone agrees that parents who are engaged with kids, particularly in the early years, are to be applauded.\n\nstill, for the monarchy to remain respected, beloved and financially supported in modern britain, there is a risk when royal heirs choose privacy too often over public accountability, says express royal correspondent richard palmer.\n\nmy fear is that if william, kate, and harry continue at their current level of involvement in official royal duties and try to shut off the rest of their lives from the public for the next decade, there will be little left to interest people, palmer says.\n\narbiter, for one, thinks that will and kate and their advisers are fully aware of such pitfalls, and are prepared.\n\nthe last few months have been quite good for them — they realize they are not infallible, that they need to take advice and to make sensible choices, she says. no one can keep an upward trajectory forever... they're just going to have to step up in a bigger capacity at home, because people want to see them and the children more.
derek jeter won't be the first player elected to baseball's hall of fame in unanimous fashion. his old new york yankee teammate, mariano rivera, beat him to that distinction just a year ago.\n\nyet, as ballots are tallied in january and induction ensues on july 26 in cooperstown, jeter, unanimous or not, will represent a final checkpoint in baseball's shrine: the last hall of famer for whom widespread fame was truly a part of the equation.\n\nwhile advanced metrics and a general sense he was merely an average defensive shortstop have haunted jeter the past two decades, he is objectively, overwhelmingly qualified for cooperstown. with 3,465 hits and a .310 average over 20 seasons, and a postseason dossier extensive enough to comprise a 21st season, jeter has more than enough ammo to quiet the naysayers.\n\nhe will have his day at the hall, and if his 2014 farewell tour is any indication, the grassy expanses of cooperstown will be overflowing with pinstriped and gray no. 2 jerseys. and as the final single numeral in yankee history enters cooperstown, it in a way closes the book on an era when baseball – and its greatest stars – enjoyed a prominent place in the nation's zeitgeist.\n\noh, we're not here to weep for baseball. with industry revenues approaching $11 billion, nobody is going broke. with countless ways to access the game – via mobile apps, social media channels or even still through the magic of television – today's big leaguers can touch many more corners of the world than their predecessors.\n\nyet since the time jeter first stepped on the field in 1995 to this year when he'll earn hall of fame induction, baseball has faced a vexing and ruthless dichotomy: as it stacks cash, it withers away cultural currency.\n\nmuch has been made of major league baseball's inability to market its stars, and many of those critiques are fair. yet, consider the cultural landscape in 1996, when jeter claimed al rookie of the year honors and the first of five championships with the yankees, and today.\n\njeter and the yankees' game 6 conquest of the atlanta braves was watched by 30.4 million people, earning a 19.1 rating and 34 audience share, according to nielsen. the four top-rated shows that week? world series game 5, game 6, game 4 and game 3.\n\ngame 2 ranked ninth that week but it drew 19.4 million viewers and a 14 rating, out-drawing monday night football's 17.8/12, and relegating mnf – entrenched on abc for 25 years at that point – to a 19th-place finish.\n\nthis year? the nationals and astros provided a compelling and occasionally controversial seven-game drama that was a delight for baseball aficionados – but a relative blip at the proverbial water cooler.\n\nsome 23 million viewers watched the decisive game 7, but the series-wide numbers were cut almost exactly in half from jeter's fall classic debut: an 8.1 rating, a 16 share, with 13.9 million average viewers, compared to 17.4/29/25.2 million in '96.\n\nthe head-to-head, over-the-air showdown with big football also flipped: this year's game 5 world series notched a 2.4 rating and 10.2 million viewers, no match for sunday night football's kansas city-green bay tilt that attracted a 5.1 rating and 16.9 million viewers.\n\nof course, this relevance drain is not unique to baseball, or virtually anything that's not the nfl.\n\nthe same year the jeter-era yankees won their first title, nbc's friends saw its viewership peak at 29.4 million viewers per episode; even still, its 18.7 rating was only good for third place that year, behind er (22) and seinfeld (21.2).\n\nyet even as friends eventually climbed to no. 1, its audience dropped from that point onward, a harbinger of what all media would face in coming decades.\n\nlike world series ratings, tv's mega-franchises aren't what they were; cbs' the big bang theory finished first, second or third in its last four seasons, but its best rating was just 12.7 in those four years leading up to its 2019 finale.\n\nin that vein, sheldon can be no. 1 on a ratings chart, but never connect in a manner ross and rachel and chandler and monica did – and even still do, in our nostalgia-obsessed present.\n\nsame for jeter, whose good looks, benign manner and placement on one of the world's most iconic franchises made for a near perfect storm of marketability.\n\nnever mind the decades-long relationships with gatorade and nike – where he ranked just below mj himself on the jordan brand masthead. jeter's borderline a-list status looks even more stark in this era when baseball stars starve for recognition.\n\nhe guested 11 times on david letterman's show. sat down with barbara walters. remains the only baseball player ever to host an episode of saturday night live. made an appearance on seinfeld and acted alongside jack nicholson and adam sandler and mark wahlberg and will ferrell on the silver screen.\n\nlittle wonder, then, that at the time of his retirement, jeter ranked second to only peyton manning among active athletes in name recognition, according to forbes.\n\ntoday's stars are far from that lofty status, even if they're better baseball players than jeter.\n\nwhile the q ratings system is not a perfect science, it's nonetheless notable that three-time al mvp and burgeoning all-time great mike trout is familiar with just 22% of the public, and 50% of sports fans, according to an august survey. (steph curry and drew brees doubled his number in the former category, and tom brady and lebron james in the latter).\n\ntoday's stars may be objectively better baseball players but operate in a far different media landscape than the relatively barren turn-of-the-century world jeter navigated.\n\noh, for the days when aol instant messenger was a tv show's or a sport's or a star's chief rival. the internet, myspace, netflix, facebook, ps1, 2, 3 and 4, the iphone, pokemon go, tiktok – the only guarantee in this environment is audience will be subjected to further fragmentation as new platforms arrive.\n\nthere's a multitude of reasons why baseball – with its slower pace and structure that makes star-making far less conducive than the nba or nfl - struggles in this environment. tv ratings tell one story; social media followings tell another.\n\ntrout and the occasionally brash bryce harper each have 1.7 million instagram followers. mookie betts, an mvp and world series champion on the highly popular boston red sox, has 691,000.\n\nfor context: lebron james has 54 million instagram followers; his 15-year-old son, bronny, has more than double trout's total, with 3.9 million. trout may mean the world to baseball, a far more significant figure than, say, the utah jazz's donovan mitchell is to the nba. yet even mitchell (2.7 million) enjoys a far healthier social media presence than trout.\n\nhow would a young jeter fare in this environment if he debuted in 2016 instead of 1996? would his high-profile relationships (mariah carey, jessica biel, minka kelly, etc.) help him win the proverbial internet and burnish his fame?\n\nor would his reserved public manner, combined with baseball's overall challenge to maintain its foothold in a buzzier, busier world, confine him to fringe celebrity?\n\nregardless, it still feels as if he's the last of his kind.\n\ntwo years from now, alex rodriguez and david ortiz will be eligible for the hall of fame, though the former's strong ties with performance-enhancing drugs may keep him out. both he and big papi are certainly recognizable, and the many red carpets in a-rod's future thanks to his impending marriage to jennifer lopez will certainly boost his image.\n\nbeyond that, it seems baseball only has the greatness of its players to rely on, which should be good enough.\n\ncoming years will see carlos beltran, adrian beltre, chase utley and ichiro suzuki voted into cooperstown. fast forward a decade or more, and trout, clayton kershaw, justin verlander and other contemporaries will have their day of glory.\n\nall will be deserving. many were jeter's superior on the field.\n\nnone could match his fame, however. and you wonder if anyone ever will.
maria puente\n\nusa today\n\nfrom romantic and girlishly demure to knock-out, drop-dead glamour, the late princess diana's journey from naive teen to global fashion goddess will be on display at kensington palace next year, nearly 20 years after her shocking death.\n\ndiana: her fashion story will open feb. 24 at the palace, the former home of the late princess of wales and the current home of both her sons, prince william and prince harry, and her two grandchildren, prince george and princess charlotte of cambridge.\n\nthe exhibit, the first diana-focused show at the palace in 10 years, will trace the evolution of diana's look and explore how she learned to use her image and her fashion to help showcase the causes she cared about, according to historic royal palaces,the charity that operates royal palaces and estates that also are open to the public as museums.\n\nthe exhibit will explore the story of a young woman who had to quickly learn the rules of royal and diplomatic dressing, who in the process put the spotlight on the british fashion industry and designers, says eleri lynn, curator of the show. we see her growing in confidence throughout her life, increasingly taking control of how she was represented, and intelligently communicating through her clothes. this is a story many women around the world can relate to.\n\nthe exhibit will also feature a temporary white garden, dedicated to her life, image and style, in the palace's historic sunken garden, which will be planted with such flowers and foliage as tulips and scented narcisii, a carpet of forget-me-nots and pots of classic english white roses.\n\nbut the main event will be the celebrated outfits from throughout diana's short public life, from 1981 until she was killed in a paris car crash on aug. 31, 1997, at age 36. from glamorous gowns worn in the 1980s after her 1981 marriage to prince charles, to the chic catherine walker suits she wore on engagements in the 1990s, the exhibit will explore diana's relationships with her favorite designers through some of their original fashion sketches created for her during the design process.\n\nfamiliar highlights will include the pale pink emanuel blouse worn for diana's engagement portrait by lord snowdon in 1981; and victor edelstein's inky blue velvet gown that she wore to dance with john travolta at the white house in 1985.\n\nsome outfits are going on public display for the first time, such as a blue tartan emanuel suit (david and elizabeth emanuel also designed her memorably pouf-y wedding gown) that she wore on an official visit to venice in the 1980s. the suit, a rare survival of diana's day-wear, was only recently rediscovered and acquired by historic royal palaces at auction.\n\ndiana's clothes and artifacts have been traded at auction for years; just weeks before her death, she auctioned off some of her outfits in new york to raise more than $3 million for charity, at the suggestion of prince william.\n\nthe travolta gown has been bought and sold multiple times; among the most recent was an auction in london in 2013 when it sold for more than $360,000 to an anonymous british man who wanted it to cheer up his wife.

educators, school staff and childcare providers starting in march as a way to get children back in classrooms.\n\nthe move is aimed at jumpstarting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance classes for most of california's 6 million k-12 students. the news comes a day after california's legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools in the spring. newsom said that wasn't fast enough and suggested he could veto it.\n\ni can't support something that's going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids, he said.\n\nmeanwhile, the state's virus cases, infection rates and hospitalizations have dropped precipitously after reaching record highs in early january. cases have fallen to 6,700 per day from a peak of more than 40,000, and hospitalizations are a third of what they were six weeks ago.\n\nwinter storm delays more than half of california's weekly vaccine supply\n\napproximately 702,000 vaccine doses en route to the golden state have been stymied by the winter storm ravaging the middle of the country, newsom said friday at a news conference.\n\nstate officials had anticipated receiving 1.2 million doses this week. as a result of the delay, pharmacies in multiple counties have reported canceling hundreds of first-dose appointments. others expressed frustration with the lack of resources and information available.\n\nthe vaccine supply coming to san francisco is limited, inconsistent, and unpredictable, making vaccine planning difficult, the city's covid command center said, as reported by the san francisco chronicle.\n\nwhile the governor didn't know when the doses would arrive, he said after the storm passes he expects a ramp-up of vaccine allotment from the federal government with modest increases every week.\n\nin other vaccination news, public health clinics in riverside county have lost 263 doses of the vaccine, according to county spokesperson jose arballo jr., who had previously told the desert sun that the county did not track this information. this week he said he'd been mistaken.\n\narballo said vaccinations could be lost in a number of ways, including a syringe breaking either during vaccination or from being dropped, a vial being dropped, or a vial being exposed to too much light or sunshine.\n\ncalifornia loosens rules for high school sports\n\nthe california department of public health issued new guidelines friday for youth and high school sports, opening the door for a quicker return to action for several sports, including football.\n\naccording to the report, outdoor high-contact sports can be played in counties in the purple or red tier with a case rate at or below 14 per 100,000. there are currently 27 counties in the state with less than 14 cases per 100,000.\n\nthose sports include football and water polo from the current season. under the new guidance, those sports can resume once the county reaches that threshold if all players and coaches get tested once per week.\n\nbefore friday, outdoor contact sports would not have been allowed until a county had reached the orange tier, which would've meant less than four cases per 100,000.\n\nthis new guidance, which not include indoor sports, will go into effect feb. 26.\n\neasily digestible bite-sized news bits\n\nfor those of you who fear commitment to larger news

matthew stafford is the best player the detroit lions have. and the most dedicated. so when your best and most dedicated player comes to and you and suggests maybe parting company would be the best thing, you ought to be worried about your team.\n\nso much for the happy glow the lions front office put out last week. it turns out they knew all the time that stafford had pretty much had enough. if we are to believe the reports, the 32-year-old quarterback approached them after the season and said he'd be open to going elsewhere. supposedly, the lions brass has agreed.\n\nwhich means the first task facing the nascent duo of brad holmes and dan campbell — neither of whom have ever made an nfl trade on their own — will be trying to find fair value for their most important player.\n\ngood luck.\n\nthis is bad news on many fronts. first of all, with the story now out there, teams know the lions are seeking to trade stafford, and maybe even have to. so much for leverage. plus, these days starting quarterbacks tend to fetch draft picks, and even if the lions get a first rounder, unless it's jacksonville's no. 1 pick and they take trevor lawrence, everything else is a crap shoot.\n\nanswer honestly. do you really trust this franchise with drafting? they've turned a no. 2 pick into charles rogers, a no. 3 into joey harrington, a no. 5 into ezekiel ansah and a no. 10 into eric ebron.\n\nand don't tell me there is any quarterback besides lawrence who is a sure thing in this draft. certainly not as sure as stafford now and for another year.\n\nyes, the lions have a new man pulling the draft strings. the former college scouting director of the rams. does that make you confident or nervous?\n\nwhatever the case, it'll be a shakeup of seismic proportions. stafford is a known entity. the only star player the lions really have. go ahead. who's next? the injured kenny golladay? frank ragnow in the distance? there's no one on the defense, just a few names past their glory days. they've got a really good punter, if that makes you feel better.\n\nthe rebuild is on\n\nbut take stafford off this team, and you are truly starting over. and maybe that's the only thing they can do. living in the middle at 5-11 and 6-10 gets you nowhere.\n\nbut this news, which broke on saturday, is another bang to the gong that signals how long and consistently the lions mess things up.\n\nstafford was the top pick in the 2009 draft, detroit's reward for enduring an 0-16 season. he became the fastest player in nfl history to 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 yards. he holds virtually all the lions passing marks. from 2011 to 2019 he started every single game. he's played through all kinds of injuries. put up big numbers. made one pro bowl and led the lions to three playoff games in three separate years. i know that sounds pathetic. but it's actually more than any previous lions' starter in more than 50 years.\n\non top of that, stafford is a quality guy. i've gotten to know him fairly well over the years. what you see is what you get. he's a stand-up person. the ultimate teammate. a leader. a grinder. a spotlight-avoider. a non-complainer. his stand over the summer during the george floyd protests revealed a man who's fully morphed from taking things seriously to doing things seriously.\n\ni know him well enough to say if he indeed approached the lions about this, then he's been bottling it inside for a long time. the last time he spoke with the media, following another dismal season, he reiterated that he loves it here in detroit. i believe that's true. his kids have been raised here. his marriage blossomed here. he's intricately involved with the community and charities here.\n\nhe's a lion through and through. but anyone who's that much a lion must know the following feelings: heartbreak. frustration. aggravation. depression.\n\ncan you blame him for seeking greener pastures?\n\nhard to blame him\n\nsomeone will get themselves a whale of a quarterback, just turning 33 in a league where guys are playing beyond 40. and if you like stafford, part of you might be happy if he gets to play, say, for bill belichick in new england, or with all those weapons in new orleans, or with that young aggressive group in washington.\n\nmark my words. if stafford gets with a real coach and a reliable offensive line, his biggest achievements are ahead of him.\n\nbut it's shame he never had that here. he was coached by jim schwartz, jim caldwell, matt patricia and darrell bevell. not exactly a hall of fame group. and his coordinators were even less remarkable. turn him loose with that arm and some innovative minds and who knows what will happen?\n\nand maybe that's what he's after. maybe he realizes there are only so many autumns left. he's got tools. he's got talent. but he can't coach the team, can't build the roster, can't make the trades. at some point, maybe, like every lions fan, a player throws his hands up. heck, it took bobby ross less than two seasons before he was screaming i don't coach this ----!\n\nit's not the city. it's not the fans. it's the franchise. would you want to spend your entire career here if you had enough talent to possibly make a super bowl?\n\nso begins the long goodbye to the best quarterback the lions have ever had. and the long hello to a rebuild that could try the patience of even us, the league's longest-suffering fans base. when you think this through, you know what you feel like saying to stafford? send us a postcard. we're not going anywhere.\n\ncontact mitch albom: malbom@freepress.com. check out the latest updates with his charities, books and events at mitchalbom.com.
josh smith\n\ncredit.com\n\nwith the recent passing of the tax cuts and jobs act, many americans are wondering how their finances will be affected. that's a fair question, since a tax overhaul of this size and scope hasn't happened since the 1980s.\n\nnews reports have come out since the signing of the bill detailing how some companies have been able to provide new raises, bonuses, and benefits to employees. since many americans are employed by someone else, you may want to know: how will the new tax bill affect me as an employee?\n\nhire an accountant\n\nthere are big changes coming, so even if you don't expect to see much of a change, it's still a worthwhile investment to consult a tax professional — whether that's a cpa or just a tax preparer. they may be able to spot problems with your filing or even help you get deductions you didn't know you qualified for.\n\nrun a projection\n\nit's not all that difficult to run a projection of how much your taxes will cost or return to you, even if you aren't quite ready to file. if you do it now, you can get an estimate of how much you may owe, if anything. this will leave you with more time to file an extension if necessary.\n\nmore:residents in this city owe the irs more than $7,000 during tax time\n\nmore:timing is everything: the 4 best times to file your taxes\n\nmore:these are the most important tax forms and documents you need for filing\n\nupdate your withholdings\n\nwhen we first start a job, we all have to fill out paperwork about our tax withholdings. contact your hr representative to ask about updating your withholdings. this is worth doing every year or every time you and/or your family experience a life event, such as the marriage, birth of a child, or buying a home.\n\nrethink buying or selling your home\n\nspeaking of homes, your mortgage interest is still deductible, but only up to $750,000 now. (previously it was up to $1 million.) if you were planning on taking out a mortgage over that amount this year, consult a financial advisor to decide if this is the right move for you.\n\ndon't count on deducting your moving expenses\n\n2017 will be the last tax year where employees can deduct expenses if they relocate specifically for a job. if you are considering doing that this year, see if your employer will foot part of the bill, especially if it's not a voluntary move on your part. their answer might pleasantly surprise you!\n\nassess your retirement situation\n\nif you have a 401k or roth ira, consider increasing your contribution. it may help your tax game in the long run. the tax rules around rolling over these types of retirement accounts have changed, so make sure you're taking advantage of them.\n\nreconsider taking out a home equity loan\n\nunder the new tax law, home equity loans will be taxed differently. previously, the amount was tax deductible. this will no longer be the case after this tax year. many expect home equity loans to become more expensive moving forward.\n\ndon't rely on a salt deduction\n\nthose who live in states with famously high tax rates (such as new york and california) will be disappointed to learn that state and local taxes can no longer be deducted. if you live in one of these states, or any other highly taxed state, begin saving now.\n\ndouble check on your commuter benefits\n\npreviously, employers were incentivized through tax breaks to offer commuter benefits to employees. this deduction is going away for businesses, but with the other tax breaks for corporations, it may end up being a wash. check with your employer on the future of this benefit. personal contributions are still deductible up to $255.\n\nassess your financial situation holistically\n\nwhether or not you're financially savvy, you may want to take this opportunity to assess your financial situation as it currently stands and weigh it against your long-term financial goals. while the tax reform bill may not affect your day-to-day life right now, it's always a good idea to take a step back and look at the big picture once in a while.\n\nmore from credit.com\n\nproperty taxes & your mortgage\n\na tax audit: will it happen to you?\n\ncan my taxes mess with my credit?\n\nthis article originally appeared on credit.com.\n\njosh is the content manager at credit.com. he works with leaders and industry experts in the credit industry to create educational and timely articles that consumers can use to make more informed decisions. credit.com is a usa today content partner offering personal finance news and commentary. its content is produced independently of usa today.
with manny pacquiao set to fight adrien broner saturday night in las vegas, the curious case of freddie roach lingers.\n\nin short, how is it that roach, the esteemed boxing trainer, is back in pacquiao's corner?\n\nover the past 15 years, he has played an instrumental role in the rise of pacquiao (60-7-2, 39 kos), the filipino boxer who has won world titles in eight divisions. but unceremoniously, roach then became a castoff.\n\nin july 2017, after pacquiao suffered a controversial loss to australian jeff horn, pacquiao didn't bother to call roach before pacquiao's next fight. and without roach in his corner, pacquiao delivered his first knockout in nine years with a tko victory in july over argentine brawler lucas matthysse.\n\nyet now, with the 40-year-old pacquiao fighting the 29-year-old broner in a bout to be televised by showtime ppv, there in plain view have been the signature black, horn-rimmed glasses, the 5-6 frame and cheerful disposition of roach.\n\nhe's back.\n\nmore:quite the contrast: senator manny vs adrien broner\n\nthey're like a married couple,'' said justin fortune, pacquiao's strength and conditioning coach, and it's like they had a trial separation.''\n\npacquiao has dodged questions about what went wrong between him and roach.\n\nit's been a long time that i didn't speak to freddie,'' he said. i was busy in the philippines.''\n\nbut in an interview with usa today sports, roach, 58, talked in detail about what transpired.\n\nin 2017, pacquiao was juggling responsibilities as a senator while preparing for his fight against horn. sometimes it meant pacquiao's work days lasted up to 18 hours a day, according to fred sternburg, pacquiao's publicist.\n\nroach said the demanding schedule contributed to pacquiao losing to horn by unanimous decision.\n\nmanny fought one good round in that fight, i thought,'' roach said. and he almost knocked (horn) out in the ninth. and then i told him give me one more round like that, he'll be all set, and he just couldn't do it. it wasn't there.''\n\nafter the fight, roach said, he spoke bluntly to pacquiao.\n\ni told him being a senator and being a professional boxer at this level is not working,'' roach recalled. i said, 'i think that it's really hurting you to do both. i think you should pick one or the other.' \n\npacquiao walked away without saying a word, roach said.\n\nat a nov. 20 press conference in beverly hills, calif., to promote his fight with broner, pacquiao said roach would be part of his team again. only he still hadn't talked to his longtime trainer.\n\npacquiao made the call later in the day and a deal was in place soon after, according to roach.\n\nroach was asked to play more of a supervisory role and work alongside filipino trainer buboy fernandez, pacquiao's close friend. but roach was glowing one day during training camp after he'd held the mitts and caught pacquiao's punches. just like the old days.\n\nlike always, i'll go till he's finished,'' roach said. and like always, 12 rounds later he says, 'that's enough.'\n\neveryone says that's the best work he's had in a long, long time, ok? me and him work well together. we know each other quite well.''\n\nlikely factors behind the reconciliation have become clear.\n\nduring a recent interview, when talking about pacquiao's political career, roach did not express concern about whether pacquiao could juggle politics and boxing. rather, roach mused about the possibility of pacquiao running for president in the philippines — and then becoming the first president to win a boxing championship.\n\npacquiao, meanwhile, has spent less time focused on political responsibilities and has taken more time off during training to make sure his body recovers. with roach supervising, of course.\n\nyou can't replace that knowledge that freddie has,'' said fortune, the strength and conditioning. and if manny's happy, i'm happy.''\n\nor as pacquiao cagily said, i don't have any problem with freddie roach.
bill keveney\n\nusa today\n\nspoiler alert: this story contains significant details from monday's series finale of a&e's bates motel.\n\nin the end, norman bates got his wish: he'll be with his mother for eternity.\n\nthe psychologically damaged killer at the heart of a&e'sbates motel — a prequel to alfred hitchcock's psycho that charted a different course —- came to his own end, buried next to his mother in monday's series finale of the five-season drama.\n\nnorman (freddie highmore), obsessed with his dead mother, norma (vera farmiga), died at the hands of her other son, dylan (max thieriot), after his delusions could no longer stand up to reality.\n\nin the episode, norman comes home and is consumed by images of the (series) pilot and is thinking he's back at that time and his mother is alive and they're going to make things great, highmore says. but his dream starts to unravel when dylan says, 'she's dead. she really isn't here, norman.' \n\nas norma's embalmed corpse sits at an immaculately set dinner table, norman charges at dylan with a knife after his half-brother challenges his view of reality. dylan then fatally shoots him in self-defense, an action producers say norman instigated as he saw his fantasy world crumble.\n\nnorman puts dylan in a position where he has no choice. we hope there was a certain beauty to norman having this final moment of clarity where he recognized he had no options that were better than this, says executive producer carlton cuse. he forces dylan to do something, and that action is the final act in his tragedy.\n\nexecutive producer kerry ehrin sees this final bates killing as an act of brotherly love.\n\nnorman is in such a hopeless place that he's reaching out to his brother to fix it for him in the only way he can think of in the moment, she says. there's caring and love, even though the incident itself is horrific and tragic and heartbreaking.\n\nthe finale includes plenty of action before norman's death. early in the episode, norman — taken from jail at gunpoint by norma's vengeful husband, alex romero (nestor carbonell) — shows alex her corpse, beautifully situated in the snow. norman then turns the tables and kills romero before returning to the motel and his own eventual demise.\n\namid bates' bloodshed, there is at least one bright sign. in a scene that takes place some time after norman's death, dylan, whose marriage to emma (olivia cooke) was frayed by his support for norman's legal defense, is happily reunited with his wife and their growing daughter.\n\nfrom very early on, we thought that dylan and emma deserved to survive this tragedy and come out the other side, cuse says. there's so much sadness and loss that we wanted there to be one story that had a ray of hope to it.\n\nhighmore acknowledges the severity of norman's lethal crimes, but still feels for a character who struggles with and eventually succumbs to his delusions. he points to norman's urging, earlier this season, that marion crane (rihanna) leave the motel, knowing that would prevent him from acting on his murderous urges.\n\nit's not that i'm condoning certain actions of his, but i hope we feel sympathy for him at the very end. i think he's always tried to be a good person, tried to be nice and do what he thought was best, highmore says. what makes him appealing is that he's never really been out to get people.
sharon peters\n\nspecial for usa today\n\nyou're a successful fiftysomething author and former federal prosecutor with four kids, a quite famous husband (novelist michael chabon), and raging mood swings that therapy and the usual pharmaceuticals no longer blunt. what do you do?\n\nwhat ayelet waldman did was break the law and secretly consume minuscule doses of lsd every third day for a month, monitoring and recording the changes in her moods, relationships and productivity.\n\na really good day: how microdosing made a mega difference in my mood, my marriage and my life (knopf, 219 pp., ***½ out of four stars) is the chronicle of waldman's short experiment with what most regard as a dangerous mind-bending psychedelic. she, on the other hand, asserts that the tiny doses she consumed amounted mostly to a sip of serenity, or something close to it.\n\nrelentlessly honest and surprisingly funny (in parts), the book is also an energetically researched history of this drug (which until it was criminalized in the 1960s was regarded by many researchers and counselors as a helpful tool in addressing several forms of mental illness).\n\nwaldman's underlying bias — that lsd was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. but she produces some very decent data and arguments. it's worth noting that she taught a course on the war on drugs at uc berkeley school of law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.\n\nin modified diary form, waldman details her use of and reactions to lsd microdoses (two drops, about one-tenth of a typical recreational dose), branching off for sweeping forays into drug history, drug law and some of the most private corners of her life. she was motivated by a lifetime held hostage by the vagaries of mood, and writes that at the worst times she's beset with self-loathing, and knotted with guilt and shame….overtaken by a pervasive sense of hopelessness.\n\nonce she embarked on this experiment, she experienced the probably predictable moments of fretting over whether she would have to be resuscitated by emts and worrying about how wretchedly irresponsible she was, what with all those children counting on her.\n\nalthough hers was a journey few will take, a really good day reads almost like an everywoman's experience, because waldman's fears and reactions are so commonplace. she is so likable in her flaws and her determination that it's a relief to learn that the microdoses (or possibly her therapy sessions or maybe even a placebo effect, she acknowledges) allowed enough of a head shift that her life has become easier, lighter.\n\nshe had the courage, the credentials and the insight to make this journey and tell us about it. they all add up to a fine read.\n\n—————\n\nsharon peters is author of trusting calvin: how a dog helped heal a holocaust survivor's heart.
don't believe the rumors. howard stern's 20-year marriage is still going strong.\n\nthat's the message beth ostrosky stern, 46, brought to the ellen degeneres show that aired friday.\n\ntwenty years of marital bliss. i'm setting the record straight right here. i love my howard, beth said while sitting on the stage next to degeneres. he's a great guy.\n\nthe rumor mill started up last week when howard and beth had a disagreement, and beth told her husband that he was being grumpy and a debbie downer.\n\nhe then talked about their problems on his siriusxm show.\n\nat least that's what beth suspects is what caused the uproar that followed. because she doesn't actually listen to his show.\n\nthe google alerts come: 'howard and beth are breaking up. marital problems' there's pictures of us with lighting bolts between our heads. i don't know what's going on, said beth. apparently, he spoke about us on the air. this was last week. and it spread like wildfire.\n\nstrangers even stopped her in the street and wished her well.\n\nthe other day, someone comes up to me and said, 'i'm so sorry about what's going on with you and howard, i hope you make it.' i had no idea what was going on, said beth.\n\nconsider that discussion closed.\n\nbut things are getting ugly on the animal front for beth, the host of hallmark channel's kitten bowl vi.\n\nshe and howard foster a one-eyed kitten named pebble.\n\nshe's the biggest jerk. i love her to the last day, forever and ever, says beth. she attacks me, howard can't even touch her. i love you so much pebble, but you are a jerk.
j.j. watt will be 32 next month, but the man can still move. heck, he just beat a guy more than six years his junior, texans quarterback deshaun watson, out of houston.\n\nand good for watt.\n\nhis best years are almost certainly behind him, and there was definitely no super bowl trophy in front of him had he remained with the texans, who drafted him 11th overall in 2011 but are currently an organization seemingly in complete disarray. but now, by forfeiting what would have been a $17.5 million non-guaranteed salary in 2021 with friday's release – a move that simultaneously helps extricate houston from its salary cap issues – watt has the freedom to sign with any team immediately rather than wait for the start of nfl free agency march 17, when the contracts of pending free agents officially expire.\n\nso where does watt, one of three men in nfl history to win defensive player of the year three times (along with lawrence taylor and aaron donald), go next? a number of factors are likely to be in play.\n\nnfl power rankings:buccaneers are no. 1, but who's next?\n\ndan wolken:urban meyer's 'character and leadership' con continues in jacksonville\n\ntroy aikman:dallas cowboys, dak prescott are not in rebuild mode\n\n► watt left a lot of money on the table to leave the texans and surely knows he can no longer command top dollar at his age after coming off the least productive full season of his 10-year career. assuming money isn't the variable driving him to his next destination, a world of possibilities could open up for him.\n\n► houston had never won a playoff game prior to watt's arrival in 2011. but starting in his rookie season, when watt returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown to help beat the bengals in the wild-card round, the texans won four playoff games. however watt, a man long driven to achieve glory on super sunday, has never even reached an afc title game. he'll surely be looking for a team he believes can win now.\n\n► watt spent most of his career as a left defensive end, often devouring helpless right tackles, in houston's base 3-4 defense. though scheme fit for his next team will surely be a consideration for both sides, it seems unlikely to be the overriding determination.\n\nwith those thoughts in mind, here are 10 teams (listed alphabetically) that could be fits, some better than others, for jjw:\n\nbaltimore ravens\n\nmatt judon, their leading sack man each of the past two seasons, is headed for free agency and seeking a contract that will average $20 million annually, per espn. watt could be a far more cost-effective option, especially if he falls into more of a rotational role on passing downs. quarterbacks wouldn't enjoy staring across the line of scrimmage and seeing watt and calais campbell, even at their advanced ages.\n\nbuffalo bills\n\na marriage between watt and a western new york community saturated with bills mafia would surely be a happy (if brief) one. buffalo, which finished one win shy of the super bowl last season, didn't have a player with more than five sacks on a middling defense. watt's five sacks in 2020 were his fewest over a 16-game season. however, his 17 quarterback hits would have easily paced the bills, who would have to make some cap room to accommodate him. still, for a team that might only be a player or two away, watt might just be one of those players.\n\nchicago bears\n\nthey were a wild-card team in 2020 but don't have available cap space right now ... or a good idea who their quarterback will be in 2021. but the bears do provide the unique opportunity to play in the windy city – where watt's wife, kealia, is a member of the national women's soccer league's chicago red stars. watt probably also wouldn't mind a defensive union with bears olb khalil mack.\n\ncleveland browns\n\na team that took a quantum leap in 2020 under coach of the year kevin stefanski could use help on a defense that ranked 22nd against the pass. imagine the damage watt could do playing opposite all-pro de myles garrett and alongside disruptive dt sheldon richardson. and given the way the browns' run-heavy offense can both milk and control the clock, watt wouldn't find that he has to play nearly as many snaps.\n\ngreen bay packers\n\nthe pack have massive cap issues, roughly $28 million overspent at present, per over the cap, a figure they'll have to reduce to zero by march 17. but they also represent a singular chance for watt, a proud badger, to return to his native wisconsin. and given how this defense was exposed in the last two nfc championship games, adding watt might be a very nice to way to give league mvp aaron rodgers help at a discount.\n\nlos angeles rams\n\nthey boast the league's no. 1 defense and are clearly going after the brass ring following their damn-the-torpedoes trade for qb matthew stafford. a pairing of donald and watt is not only extremely tantalizing, but perhaps wholly necessary given olb leonard floyd, l.a.'s no. 2 sack man in 2020, is poised to cash in during free agency – an arena where the rams don't seem able to compete for prime talent given they're $27 million in the red cap-wise.\n\npittsburgh steelers\n\nthey wouldn't make a ton of sense for watt schematically or from a cap standpoint given pittsburgh needs to shed about $32 million to be compliant by the time the new league year starts. but if a scenario arises for j.j. to join his brothers, olb t.j. watt and fb derek watt, in pittsburgh with the reigning afc north champions, is he going to say no?\n\nseattle seahawks\n\nthey haven't had a premier edge rusher since the days of michael bennett and frank clark and relied heavily on s jamal adams to create havoc in 2020, when his 9½ sacks established a single-season league record for defensive backs. but it would make more sense to get pressure up front from watt and not expose the back end so regularly by bringing adams into the box. and an acquisition of watt's caliber might mollify suddenly publicly disgruntled qb russell wilson, a university of wisconsin product like watt.\n\ntampa bay buccaneers\n\nwhy not help the bucs run it back? rickey jackson, neil smith and demarcus ware are just a few all-time great pass rushers who switched teams late in their careers to successfully snatch a first super bowl ring. the bucs have nearly $30 million in available cap space, though face decisions on what to do about soon-to-be free agents like olb shaq barrett, wr chris godwin and dl ndamukong suh. regardless, watt seems like an ideal short-term fit for a group of mercenaries in win immediately mode.\n\ntennessee titans\n\nafc finalists in 2019 and afc south champions in 2020, they seem close to a breakthrough – especially if they can upgrade a pass rush that managed only 19 sacks last season. going to nashville would reunite watt with coach mike vrabel, his defensive coordinator in houston in 2017, and allow him two opportunities to play the division rival texans in 2021.\n\n***\n\nfollow usa today sports' nate davis on twitter @bynatedavis\n\nif you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you. join

jefferson city, mo. — gov. eric greitens' affair was known to his political opponents more than a year ago, before he was elected. but despite the buzzing rumor mill, his infidelity wasn't in the public eye until last week.\n\nrumors of the affair percolated since at least the summer of 2016, said roy temple, who at the time was the chair of the missouri democratic party.\n\namong democrats and republicans alike, greitens' affair was just kind of common knowledge in political circles, said temple, whom the news-leader contacted after st. louis television station kmov reported greitens' admission of an affair and denial that he allegedly blackmailed his hairdresser.\n\ngop observers — not candidates — whispered rumors of the affair after greitens won the primary in august 2016, temple said. and as the year passed, the rumors became more specific, including the woman's identity and eventually, her ex-husband's name.\n\nat this point, temple said, he recognized the man and reached out through a mutual acquaintance, if for no other reason than to see whether there was any truth to what he had heard.\n\nmore:blackmail allegations prompt investigation of missouri governor\n\nmore:missouri gov. eric greitens admits to affair, denies blackmail\n\ntemple and the man spoke by phone in august 2016 and met later that month. then, temple said he learned a great deal more detail and was presented with documents the man retained and a recording of a march 25, 2015, conversation.\n\nin the recorded conversation, the man assured his wife that what she tells him about her march 21 encounter with greitens won't leave the car.\n\non the recording, the woman says greitens allegedly invited her into his home, talked her into his basement, bound her, blindfolded her, pulled her pants down, took a photograph of her and told her that she was never going to mention (greitens') name, otherwise there will be pictures of (her) everywhere.\n\ngreitens' attorney has said any blackmail allegation is false and denied that any such photograph was ever taken. the allegations have triggered a criminal investigation by the st. louis circuit attorney.\n\nat the time of that first encounter with his hairdresser, greitens had created an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for his gubernatorial run, and two days later, the former navy seal was in chicago to promote his book resilience: hard-won wisdom for living a better life.\n\nthe woman's ex-husband knew greitens was considering running for office and urged the woman to risk the embarrassment in publicly challenging greitens' image as a manly hero.\n\nand i'll have you know, i can destroy his career in a half an hour ..., the man tells the woman at one point on the tape. he took a picture of my wife naked as blackmail. there is no worse person. (the man's attorney, al watkins, has said that the man's agenda is to protect his children and their opinion of their mother.)\n\nthough the ex-husband did not follow through with the threat at the time, he did try to alert the future governor's wife.\n\nwatkins provided the news-leader with a message the man sent to sheena greitens using a pseudonym. the email was sent in early july 2015, at a time when the man believed his wife and eric greitens were again together at the greitens residence.\n\nthere is another woman in your home right now, the man wrote to sheena greitens, according to the email provided by watkins. i'm assuming you're out of town again. if you want to know more contact me here. i'm sorry. this isn't fake or spam. they are at the maryland address (in the central west end neighborhood of st. louis).\n\nsheena greitens' email provided an automatic reply that thanked the sender and said she was traveling with limited access to email. the man wrote again that day, several hours later: today was not the first time he has had her in your home.\n\nwhy democrats didn't go public\n\ntemple told the news-leader that he was struck by what he termed extraordinary attempts by eric greitens at that time to maintain secrecy, based on the ex-husband's account and the documents temple reviewed.\n\ngreitens has been since scrutinized for accepting millions of dollars in untraceable donations, the anonymously sourced political contributions he has received through a non-profit set up by senior aides and the illegal transfer of a donor list from the pro-veteran charity he founded to his political campaign. attorney general josh hawley is investigating greitens' and his senior staff members' use of a communication tool that deletes messages after they are read.\n\ntemple said he was supposed to meet with the ex-husband again in mid-september of 2016. instead, the democratic operative was contacted by watkins, the ex-husband's attorney. from their conversation, temple said, he understood that the ex-husband wanted time to think and that watkins was to be the go-between from then on.\n\nby then, the race between democratic attorney general chris koster and greitens was heated — but the ex-husband, who was worried about the effect on his children, did not want to go public with what he knew.\n\nif the man had expressed a desire to go public, temple said, i would have connected him to a reporter and let them make a news judgment about the affair involving greitens — who presented himself as a towering symbol of virtue and family values temple said — and allegations related to violence and threats.\n\nwatkins has pointed out that if the ex-husband had a political agenda or aimed to damage greitens' reputation, he could have gone on the record when greitens and koster were locked in a tight contest during their race's final weeks.\n\na koster campaign official confirmed to the news-leader that before the november election, they discussed with temple substantiated rumors that greitens had an extramarital affair. the koster staffer said top campaign aides did not hear about the alleged blackmail then and did not talk of the affair to koster, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nspeaking to greitens' general counsel hours before news of the affair broke wednesday, watkins said he attempted to reach out to greitens through back channels before the election to let him know that the ex-husband wanted to put the affair behind him. watkins said he was hired to put the kibosh on it and credited the democrats who knew of the affair with not going public.\n\nsince the election\n\ngreitens was elected in november 2016 and started implementing parts of his conservative agenda throughout 2017, while he continued to project the image of a patriarch of a solid, happy family. the democratic party replaced temple as state party chair, and koster's campaign staffers dispersed.\n\nrumors of the affair remained in circulation throughout the first year of the republican governor's term — and according to watkins, interest rose sharply in early to mid-december.\n\nwatkins has facilitated contact with media outlets interested in his client's story, but he has rejected the notion that he is shopping the story to various news outlets. several weeks ago, watkins said, media interest on the local and national levels reached a frenzied pitch — including a phone call by a national reporter to one of the ex-husband's children.\n\nthe dam starts to break\n\nsince kmov broke the story wednesday — based on an interview with the ex-husband, his surreptitious recording and the governor's own admission, but without on-the-record comments from the woman — the governor's private attorney has released several statements from eric and sheena greitens, and from himself.\n\na few years ago, before eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage, the joint statement said, in part. this was a deeply personal mistake. eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\n\nwhen the ex-husband went public, i knew it was him, said temple, who reiterated that he kept his word to the ex-husband to not publicize the affair.\n\ntemple said he felt free to comment to other media outlets after the news broke.\n\n#metoo's role in the reaction\n\nthe news-leader has not spoken with either the ex-husband or the woman with whom the governor cheated on his wife, instead communicating through attorneys for all three parties. the news-leader has declined to name the former couple. the woman's attorney has said his client wants to have her privacy respected.\n\nand therein lies another problem, as pointed out to the news-leader by multiple lawmakers, including rep. crystal quade, d-springfield.\n\nwe're essentially re-victimizing her by having this come forward without her consent, quade said last week. and if these allegations are true, this woman had terrible things happen to her without her consent, and it's happening all over again.\n\nquestions of power, consent and consequences gained national prominence with the rise of the #metoo movement, through which women have come forward with allegations and evidence that they have been wronged by men in positions of power.\n\njohn hancock, a gop consultant and former chair of the missouri republican party, questioned whether the #metoo movement was the proper context when the news-leader asked about the movement's possible impact on greitens' scandal.\n\nthe 'me too' movement, as i understand it, deals with sexual assault, unwanted sexual advances, and demands for sex by a superior over a subordinate. this instance, setting aside the photo / blackmail allegations which may or may not be true or provable, seems to involve a consensual sexual affair, hancock said in an email. marital infidelity is tragic for those families involved and may require years to process before healing. the current situation does not, however, appear to me to be analogous with the kinds of offenses brought to light by the recent 'me too' movement.\n\ndave robertson, a political science professor at the university of missouri-st. louis, said the best test of the impact of the #metoo movement is the accusation that he threatened the woman involved if she exposed him.\n\nthe governor denies it, and right now it is his word against her and her former husband, robertson said in an email. in a case like this, americans are more skeptical of the denier. fair or unfair, the #metoo movement undoubtedly has reduced the number of people willing to give governor greitens the benefit of the doubt, because it seems common for public figures to deny the first allegations.\n\nbennett, greitens' attorney, referred to previous statements and declined to comment further when asked tuesday by the news-leader. despite some calls for the governor to step down, greitens has not indicated that he will resign.\n\nfollow will schmitt on twitter: @ws_missouri
jessica berman has never played lacrosse, but that hasn't stopped her from becoming one of the top executives in the national lacrosse league.\n\nin august, she was appointed deputy commissioner of the national lacrosse league and is now the highest-ranking woman in a men's professional sports league. her immediate goal? to expand the nll, which now has 13 professional teams, to 16 teams.\n\ni love it, said berman, who lives in larchmont, new york. if i could have scripted the next best opportunity for me, it would be exactly this.\n\nberman said she knew by age 15 that she wanted a career in sports.\n\nshe remembers the excitement at a new york islanders game where spectators, who didn't seem to have much in common, were high-fiving and even hugging each other when their team scored a goal.\n\nlisa willis: first female coach for new york knicks' franchise\n\nsomething in that moment clicked as i watched the power of sports in bringing people together, said berman, 42.\n\ngrowing up in brooklyn, berman always found ways to be part of the sports culture, from cheerleading in her high school to tracking statistics for her school's baseball team.\n\nat the university of michigan, where she majored in sports management, she was the manager of the school's hockey, football and baseball teams.\n\nwhen i went to college back in the '90s there was no clear path on how to obtain that kind of experience, she said of managing the teams. i just went to the athletic department and i offered my services to help the different teams to kept statistics on the different players and liaised with the local newspapers on storytelling about the players.\n\nsummers were spent on professional internships with sports agents and sports marketing agencies.\n\nthose experiences led her to sports law.\n\nthe way that my mind works, i knew i would really enjoy a very analytical way of thinking and i was specifically interested in collective bargaining and understanding labor and management relationships, she said.\n\nafter graduating from the fordham university school of law, berman began her career at proskauer rose llp, in new york city specializing in labor and employment.\n\none of the firm's clients was the national hockey league.\n\nworking on labor relations issues, particularly collective bargaining agreements, convinced her she was in the right field, she said.\n\ni often describe labor relations as a marriage where you can't get a divorce. you have to find a way to work it out, she said. collective bargaining requires a lot of patience and compromise and understanding the big picture. it's about winning the war, even if you lose some small battles.\n\nafter four years with proskauer, berman was hired by the nhl in 2006 as a staff lawyer.\n\nnhl deputy commissioner bill daly, who was then head of the legal department, said the team had the opportunity to observe berman on the job while she consulted on behalf of proskauer.\n\nwe could see how she worked under stressful, difficult situations. we saw the level of expertise and creativity she brought, said daly. she is very committed to accomplishing things. anything that's put on her plate to accomplish, she'll go to great lengths to make sure it gets done.\n\nthat trait was in full display in 2013 when her husband, brad berman, a marathon runner, suffered a stroke at age 37. doctors had to cut out a chunk of his skull to relieve pressure from a ruptured blood vessel in his brain (storing it in his abdomen for future reattachment) before placing him in a coma, where he remained for six weeks.\n\nthe stroke initially left him totally paralyzed on his left side, unable to even move the left side of his face. for the next few years, jessica berman balanced work, raising the couple's two young children — both under the age of 6 — and taking care of her husband.\n\nshe also raised more than $750,000 to help the burke rehabilitation center, where her husband was being treated, to purchase machines and other equipment, including a robotic exoskeleton, needed for his progress.\n\ni often describe jessica as the quarterback of my recovery, said brad berman. there were many difficult and complicated decisions that had to be made. she collected tremendous amounts of information and did a lot of research and figured out what the best technology was in terms of helping me to recover the left inside of my body and pulled in experts from around the country to deal with my condition.\n\ntoday, he is not only well on his way to recovery, but also working full time as a tax attorney.\n\nthe couple's marriage, however, did not survive. the bermans divorced earlier this year, but remain close.\n\nour marriage didn't survive the experience. it changed the dynamics of our relationship, she said. when they say your life can change in an instant, i really know what it means.\n\nthrough it all, family, friends, the community and the nhl were pillars of support, she said.\n\ntime for change\n\nin 2015, looking for a change in her career track, berman approached gary bettman, the nhl commissioner and deputy commissioner daly: she wanted to move from the legal side to the business side to gain a better understanding of revenue generation.\n\nberman was offered the position of vice president for community development, culture and growth, responsible for designing and executing the league's strategic corporate social responsibility goals, initiatives, policies and programs.\n\none of her priorities was to increase revenue by building programming that engaged the community, such as an initiative honoring the hockey mom of the year.\n\nmillennials and gen z really leverage their own spending on brands that are committed to community and purpose, she said. and when you have programming that authentically engages the community, sponsors will align around those objectives and support the programs.\n\ntwo years ago, as she turned 40, berman said she sought out mentors to help her figure out how she could grow in her career.\n\nshe said she knew she would have to step out of her comfort zone.\n\nan opening at the national lacrosse league proved to be that opportunity.\n\nafter 13 years, i felt like my identity was intertwined with the nhl, she said. it was a very hard decision to leave, but ultimately, i felt like if i want to stretch and learn and grow, i owed it to myself to challenge myself, redefine myself in a lot of ways and see where it leads.\n\nexpanding the nll\n\nberman is not shy about her ambitions.\n\ni wanted to intentionally fill any gaps in my experience so that i'd be a qualified candidate for any opportunity that comes my way in the future, she said. whether it's to be a commissioner of a league one day or the president of a team.\n\nbut first, winning a buy-in from her kids, noah, 11, and andrew, 9, to take on a high-pressure job which would require a lot of travel was important to her.\n\nas a working mom, you're always trying to be conscious of 'where am i most needed?'  she said.\n\nfor berman, the key to her ability to balance all of this has been keeping her kids up to speed on what she's working on and why it's important.\n\ni talked to them about it before i accepted the offer and i said, 'i already work really hard. this is going to be the next level and if you guys aren't on board, i probably won't take it. we need to do this as a team or i'm going to figure something else out.'\n\nnoah, when he heard about the opportunity, he says, 'are you kidding mom? this is going to make you a pioneer,'  she said. i always say they're co-presidents of my fan club.\n\nbeing at a much smaller, emerging league (it was established in 1986) has offered berman the opportunity to grow in her role as executive vice president of business affairs.\n\nin my old role at the nhl, i touched the revenue side from a marketing standpoint, but i wasn't working directly on generating revenue, she said. now i'm involved in things like selling expansion teams, for example.\n\nwhen an expansion team is sold into a new market, there are things one quickly needs to become familiar with, such as negotiation with the prospective owner, identifying an arena for the team to play and paying a fee to buy a new team.\n\nthe nll, which currently has 13 teams, has been authorized by its board to expand to 16 teams by 2023. by comparison, the national football league, national hockey league and national basketball association each have roughly double that number.\n\nlacrosse is among the fastest growing sports in the united states, according to a recent sport & fitness industry association report.\n\nit's been really fun to learn and work on. from bringing in new sponsors to working on media rights, there are so many new things to learn, said berman.\n\nswapna venugopal ramaswamy covers women and power for the usa today network northeast. write

sandra harwitt\n\nspecial for usa today sports\n\nmelbourne — verbosity hasn't often been an inclination for serena williams and at the start of her 20th season as a tennis superstar she hasn't developed a penchant for chattiness.\n\nso it came as no surprise that when meeting the international press ahead of the australian open on saturday, she primarily chose cagey over confessions.\n\nat 35, williams arrives in melbourne with the chance to win a 23rd career grand slam trophy, which would break her shared open-era record of 22 grand slam titles with steffi graf, and place her one grand slam title away from equaling margaret court's all-time record of 24 titles.\n\nwilliams, however, had that looming possible achievement on her list of subjects not-to-be discussed.\n\noh, i'm not talking about that, she said. i'm just here to play and to win, obviously, but just to play.\n\nthat led to wonderment as to whether she'd open the door to divulging any details on her recent engagement to alexis ohanian, the co-founder of the social network reddit. williams played it mostly coquettish, but didn't totally shy away from being the future blushing bride.\n\nasked about the exciting news in her personal life, she countered with a sly smile, can you elaborate? then added, i'm just kidding.\n\nit's been really great, said williams, notably not flaunting an engagement ring. i've said from the beginning i just didn't want to think about it until after australia because i was, like, grand slams mean a lot to me.\n\nmore tennis:\n\nfrustrated serena williams loses in second round at auckland\n\nthanks to reddit, we can all now see serena williams' engagement ring\n\ni don't think i've had an opportunity to let everything sink in, she added. i won't allow it to sink in because i'm so focused. it was right in the middle of pre-season. now i'm on the road, already back at work. i don't want to get too happy because i want to stay focused.\n\nthe pending marriage supposedly on the back-burner with questions such as whether the part-time fashion designer bride-to-be will create her own wedding dress unanswered, it was back to the basics of tennis.\n\nwilliams reached the final at the first three grand slams last season, winning her 22nd major trophy at wimbledon, but lost out on the title to current no. 1 angelique kerber at the australian and garbine muguruza at the french.\n\nafter a semifinal defeat to karolina pliskova at the u.s. open, williams relinquished her no. 1 status to kerber and shut down her year, prematurely, to nurse a left knee injury.\n\nfor me, it wasn't a great season, williams said of 2016. i think for other people it would have been wonderful. it was what it was.\n\nas it turns out it wasn't a joyous start to the 2017 season for williams, who posted 88 unforced errors in a 6-4.6-7, 6-4 second round loss to fellow american madison brengle at the auckland tournament nearly two weeks ago.\n\nwilliams' opportunity to change her luck will commence with a first round meeting against belinda bencic on tuesday. they've split their two prior meetings with the swiss posting the upset in the 2015 toronto semifinals.\n\nalso at stake for williams at this australian open is a possible return to the top of the ranking charts.\n\nit's a given that if kerber journeys to the final, win or lose, she retains the no. 1 status.\n\nthe scenarios for williams to dethrone the german work out to she must reach the final, but if kerber advances to the round-of-16 williams must win the trophy.\n\ni didn't come here to lose in the first round, or the second round, or at all, said williams, sending an obvious message to the other 127 players in the draw.\n\nphotos: serena williams' grand slam wins
after only one woman went home last week (bye, elyse), this week's bachelor was going to be a bloodbath. no surprise: it was! five women left the show this week, four of whom colton sent packing himself.\n\nso, who's left?\n\nwe pick up this week right where we left off with last week's to be continued cliffhanger: with colton frustrated on the beach. heather dubs the onyeka/nicole/colton drama the moment of the century, because, sure, there's nothing more important going on in the world.\n\nonyeka confronts the group and asks if anyone feels like she's ever bullied them, and nicole later joins them.\n\nnicole, you said i bullied you, back it up! onyeka says in front of the group.\n\nthe show doesn't waste any time bringing us to the rose ceremony. there are seven roses on the table, which means two people are going home. it would be too easy for the two to be nicole and onyeka, right?\n\nwrong! the two troublemakers are out of the house faster than their backstabbing bickering match even began.\n\nand then we properly start this week's fun.\n\nlove at first sushi roll\n\ncolton and the remaining contestants head to vietnam, and hannah g. (winner of the first-impression rose) gets the first date card.\n\nhannah g. is absolutely stunning, colton says about her. every time i see her i get a little smitten. the two sneak in some spa time and get facial masks.\n\nnot gonna lie, it's hard for me to keep my hands off her, colton adds. all wrapped up at the spa, he tells her she looks like a sushi roll. i would definitely eat that sushi roll, he cheekily tells the camera.\n\nafter caelynn questions hannah g.'s authenticity as a person to cassie (i.e. wonders if there's a layer to her that they're missing), we see hannah g. open up to colton about her parents' divorce. colton's parents also are divorced and the two bond. duh, she gets the rose.\n\nhannah g. tells the camera she's falling in love with him. colton tells the camera the same. (start placing your bets, people.)\n\nfight! fight! fight!\n\ncassie, heather, tayshia, caelynn, katie, hannah b., sydney and demi go on this week's group date, are you ready to fight for love? they learn the ancient art of vovinam, a vietnamese martial art. some are more ready to fight than others.\n\ni went to sleep last night as hannah b. but i woke up this morning as hannah beast, hannah b. says. she also referred to herself as hannah beast last week, so that's a thing.\n\nthe women pair off to spar with each other. the most pivotal moment comes when demi swears katie hit her in the face and she winces and whines like a toddler. this doesn't impress colton. (remember this later, friends.)\n\ncolton opens up to tayshia after the date and tells her their one-on-ones are what he'd kill for every day. demi calls her mom with colton by her side.

pyeongchang, south korea — no disrespect to olympic gold medal prospect nathan chen, but the biggest current stars in american figure skating won't be taking to the ice this month. they'll be behind a microphone.\n\nfor many, the commentary combo of tara lipinski and johnny weir are more of a reason to tune in to the winter olympics than the individuals and pairs populating the competition itself.\n\nthe tara and johnny show came to sochi four years ago, but this time it has hit prime time on nbc and promises to be raucous, outrageous and completely unafraid to pull any punches.\n\nit is a double act that works, to the extent that the network has put them together at super bowl media day, the academy awards, the kentucky derby and the national dog show.\n\nwhen you are trying to reach a younger crowd, this is 2018, the old school way isn't going to work, lipinski, 35, told usa today sports in recent joint interview with weir. you have to be honest and lay it down exactly as you see it. there's a lot of pretty strange things in our sport and you have to have a good chuckle.\n\nthat brand of irreverent humor isn't appreciated by some of the sport's hardcore and traditionalist fans, but is adored by the wider mainstream set that truly drives ratings. figure skating hasn't boomed since the 1990s and has been left behind by the rapidly evolving media landscape. weir and lipinski are doing their darndest to bring it back.\n\nthe 90s were great, it was such a boom time, and on television in general everything was very airbrushed, very beautiful and packaged, weir said. then came the family we all love so much — the kardashians — and suddenly butt injections were on tv, lady gaga was ruling the charts, things changed and people wanted reality. we give them reality.\n\nmedal count:how is team usa faring?\n\nmeet team usa:where 2018 olympians are from\n\nmore:adam rippon gives lgbtq community athlete they can relate to\n\nlipinski, who won gold at nagano in 1998, and weir, a three-time national champion and 2008 world bronze medalist, did not cross paths during their own careers.\n\nin 2014, they were nbc's broadcast experiment, thrown together. they've never looked back. figure skating commentary may never be the same again.\n\nthe pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at lipinski's wedding to television producer todd kapostasy last summer.\n\nwhen she met weir, lipinski loved the way he spoke frankly and openly, on and off air.\n\nour sport is very political and subjective and you can hide that if you want, lipinski added. but why would you? if a skater falls five times and wins and the next skater who did stand up, doesn't (win), it is very confusing. johnny is not afraid to go out on that limb, point it out and let the judges know he didn't agree.\n\nweir was having a tough time during sochi, with his marriage to ex-husband victor voronov on the verge of collapse. things got messy with accusations flying back and forth, the matter ending up in divorce court, voronov lodging a defamation suit against weir and even a dispute over a valuable faberge egg — much of it played out through tmz and the new york tabloids.\n\nlooking back to sochi in particular, i was going through a divorce – it was awful, the most horrible time of my life as far as dealing with another human being, weir said. the best thing to come out of it was that tara and i had to bond so quickly. we were in russia, there was no one really around, i wasn't close to any of my coworkers or my bosses, i wasn't close to anybody. it was just terror. if i hadn't had her i would have panicked. (i would have) gone home or just crumbled under the pressure.\n\nlipinski remembers them working all day — then we'd cry and have therapy sessions with each other — then get back at it the next day and put together a collective breakout performance.\n\nweir keeps most of his private life out of the commentary spiel but everything else is fair game, and you can confidently bet that the chatter with him and lipinski won't be restricted to salchows and triple axels.\n\nanything can be on the agenda, from hairstyles to costumes to whatever happens to be passing through their minds at the time, and unless the viewership's tastes have dramatically changed they'll be lapping it up once more.\n\nweir and lipinski are an oddity no more. somehow, through the force of their own chemistry and personality, they have become a staple of the american olympic landscape. last time they were largely tucked away on the nbc sports network. now they are front and center — and ready to shine brighter than the glittering costumes on the ice.\n\nwe just had this chemistry that came instantly and for the last four years we have been building on that, lipinski added. america has accepted us as the voices of figure skating.\n\nas a skater, weir often found more popularity with the sport's occasional fans than he did from the traditionalists. he feels the same is true of his commentary.\n\nare we feeling more loved? he said. really hardcore skating fans … it's hard to impress them. we are getting a lot of love from people who don't watch skating and that's what we want — people to come back to our sport. but the sport itself doesn't change much, or quickly.
patrick ryan\n\nusa today\n\nwell, it's a step forward from 1989.\n\nlest you've forgotten, ryan adams proclaimed himself the ultimate swiftie in fall 2015, when he released a track-by-track cover album of taylor swift's gleaming foray into pop. although it effectively brought swift's vivid lyrics and undeniable hooks to the forefront, the sleepy, acoustic-rock slog more or less drained the life out of one of pop's best-crafted efforts in recent years.\n\nso it's a relief that adams returns to original material on follow-up prisoner (**1/2 out of ****), out friday, his 16th album and first collection of new music since his divorce from actress mandy moore was finalized last year. though he takes no risks sonically, the dissolution of their six-year marriage provides a fascinating lens through which to read this next chapter.\n\nthe 42-year-old singer/songwriter sets the scene with the stomping do you still love me?, as he ponders what went wrong and attempts to salvage the dying embers of their relationship. recalling an '80s-era bruce springsteen on the harmonica-assisted title track and doomsday, adams fights to hold on, singing on the latter, my love, we can do better than this / my love, how can you complicate a kiss? it's an aching sentiment that eventually turns into defeat on shiver and shake, in which he describes the physical distress of heartbreak and how if i wait here any longer, i'll just fade away.\n\nafter a stirring first half, prisoner treads into less affecting territory in its second, as adams continues to wallow in pain while offering little insight into what may have actually transpired between them. the exceptions are breakdown, a morose guitar ballad that veraciously captures the hopelessness that comes with breakups; and album closer we disappear, in which he painfully takes a stab at closure, conceding, you deserve a future and you know i'll never change.\n\nwith the exception of a serene saxophone solo on the sanguine tightrope, prisoner hews closer to the bare-bones arrangements of 2011's ashes & fire than his more rock-heavy self-titled album in 2014. some fans may gripe that adams is simply doing more of the same, but overall, it's a solid, sincere addition to his prolific catalog.\n\ndownload: do you still love me?, shiver and shake, breakdown
japan's environment minister is taking paternity leave, a first for a cabinet minister in the country where men rarely take time off for raising children.\n\nthe move has made waves around the country and world, even as environment minister shinjiro koizumi, a potential candidate for prime minister one day, said he'd only take off two weeks over three months.\n\nhonestly, i had to think over and over how i should take time off for child rearing, or take paternity leave, while fulfilling my public duty as environment minister, koizumi told ministry officials and reporters wednesday. unless we change the atmosphere, government employees presumably won't start taking paternity leave.\n\nthe decision comes as japan has pushed for men to take paternity leave and spend more time with their families. the government changed its rules last month allowing public servants now to take more than a month of paternity leave. governors in hiroshima and mie have taken leave, but never before has a cabinet minister.\n\nacross the country, japan's leave policy is generous, with men and women allowed to take off up to 12 months with partial pay. however, the ministry of health, labor and welfare says only 6% of eligible men took paternity leave from work in 2018.\n\nkoizumi, son of former prime minister junichiro koizumi, said he'd be taking the leave without it affecting his parliamentary and cabinet duties.\n\nkoizumi is having his first child later this month and said last year when announcing his marriage that he'd be taking the leave. some have been critical of the decision, saying he should focus on his public service duties.\n\ni hope there will be a day when lawmakers' paternity leave is no longer news, he said.\n\ni wholeheartedly support him, tokyo politician hironobu narisawa told local media, per cbs news. this will encourage other male employees.\n\nparental leave in the us:america's parents want paid family leave and affordable child care. why can't they get it?\n\n'childcare is outrageous here':real people sound off on paid leave, affordable child care\n\nin the united states, federal law allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child, however, individual employers may grant some amount of paid leave. the united states is the only oecd country that does not offer paid leave to new mothers, according to a report by the congressional research service.\n\ncontributing: the associated press. follow usa today's ryan miller on twitter @ryanw_miller
los angeles – the fast-approaching end of modern family is sinking in for the people who make the acclaimed abc comedy, cast members told usa today during an exclusive on-set visit thursday.\n\ncast, writers and crew wednesday experienced one of the final milestones on the way to the april 8 series finale: the last group script reading – table read, as it's known in the business – before they begin shooting the final half hour of the 11-season series, a five-time emmy winner for best comedy.\n\nthey shared their feelings thursday during shooting breaks between scenes from the two-part finale, which will bring the show's episode count to a lofty 250.\n\nit's getting a little real, says julie bowen, whose claire dunphy is married to phil (ty burrell) and the mother of three now-grown children. i don't like table reads to begin with. i hate them as a performative thing, because they make me very anxious. it's like doing a play. and so i thought i wouldn't care, that i'd be thrilled when we were done.\n\n'modern' maturation:ariel winter and sarah hyland on growing up on 'modern family': people love to attack women\n\nit didn't quite turn out that way. i was sobbing and sobbing by the end, she says, acknowledging that the tears will be flowing during the final week of production. turns out i'm not going to have any control over my emotions during this process.\n\nbowen, one of numerous cast members to commemorate the last table read on social media, conveyed the mood visually with an instagram post featuring a photo of long-time modern family writer and producer danny zuker: modern family's final table read is hitting @dannyzuker hard. our writers truly are the heroes of the show...\n\ned o'neill, who plays patriarch jay pritchett, the husband of gloria (sofia vergara) and father of claire and her brother, mitchell (jesse tyler ferguson), from his first marriage, says he's very happy with the final script of the series, which was created by christopher lloyd and steven levitan.\n\no'neill, speaking before shooting a scene on thursday, called it perfect, just the right amount of sentiment, but not too much. it was very good and very funny.\n\nduring the script reading, the cast sat facing the writers at a long table, as shown in vergara's instagram post below.\n\nas it progressed, i could see people getting emotional, o'neill says. when it ended, i just stood up and started applauding the writers. everybody was doing it and that lasted for, like, five minutes.\n\n'modern' milestone:exclusive 'modern family' video: with phil ill, jealousy bug bites cam in 200th episode\n\neric stonestreet, who portrays mitchell's husband, cam, posted a short video of the table-read room with trace adkins' you're gonna miss this playing as a soundtrack.\n\nthe table read was kind of tough, just having it actually dawn on everybody that it's over, burrell says, expecting more emotions in the coming days.\n\nbut i honestly feel like the dominant emotion isn't sadness. it's actually sort of an overwhelming gratitude that has a lot of people feeling emotional, he says. it's just feeling really grateful to have had the experience and to have been with these people, understanding how rare and special it's been.
bree burkitt\n\nthe spectrum\n\nst. george, utah — following tuesday nights announcement of the death of president thomas s. monson, questions have already emerged about who will be the next prophet of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints.\n\naccording to a statement previously released by the church, the appointment of a new president is viewed by members as a divinely revealed process free of internal lobbying.\n\nfollowing the death of the president, the first presidency is automatically dissolved and the two counselors in the first presidency return to positions of seniority in the quorum of the twelve apostles. in this situation, that would be president henry b. eyring and president dieter f. uchtdorf, who served as monson's two counselors since he assumed the prophet role in 2008.\n\nmore:mormon church president thomas monson dies at 90\n\nmore:mormon leader reaffirms faith's opposition to gay marriage\n\na senior apostle is then determined based on who has the highest ranking seniority from the date when they were ordained to the twelve. the longest-tenured member of the governing body is 93-year-old russell m. nelson. his appointment will not be officially named until after monson's funeral services, out of respect.\n\nthe senior apostle will then preside over a meeting of the quorum of the twelve to consider two alternatives: should the first presidency be reorganized or should they just move forward with the quorum of the twelve? a formal motion will be made and accepted.\n\nif the motion to reorganize is passed, the quorum of the twelve will unanimously select the new president, who will assume the top role in the nearly 16 million-member church. the decision is predetermined, though.\n\nthroughout the history of the church, the longest-serving apostle has always become the president of the church when the first presidency has been reorganized, according to a church release.\n\nthe next president has not been named yet, but based on this information the job is expected to go to nelson. he has served nearly 34 years after being first called to service in 1984.\n\nafter being officially selected, he will then choose two counselors from the quorum of the twelve to form a three-person presidency considered the religion's top governing body.\n\nthe second-longest serving apostle will be designated as the new president of the quorum of the twelve after the reorganization of the first presidency. this would be dallin h. oaks, who has served for 33 years and nine months.\n\nthere have been 16 presidents, including monson, since the founding of the lds church by joseph smith in 1830.\n\nthe choosing of the prophet differs from the choosing of other religious heads. for instance, traditionally, there is a 15- to 20-day waiting period from the death of a pope to the start of a conclave, the process of choosing the next leader of the catholic church.\n\nat the start of a conclave —­ latin for with key, referring to the voters being locked inside the sistine chapel ­— the 115 cardinals move into the domus santa marta, a modest five-story building tucked securely behind vatican walls.\n\nafter morning prayers, the first balloting takes place, the rev. thomas reese, author of inside the vatican: the politics and organization of the catholic church, told usa today in 2013, during the selection of pope francis, who succeeded retiring pope benedict.\n\nafter the first day, then there are customarily four votes per day, trying to reach a two-thirds majority of the cardinals. in 2013, jorge mario bergoglio was chosen on the second day on the fifth ballot and became pope francis. reese noted the last time a conclave lasted more than four days was in 1831.\n\ncontributing: marco della cava, usa today. follow bree burkitt on twitter: @breeburkitt

bill keveney\n\nusa today\n\nbeverly hills, calif. – a huge class divide hasn't stopped downton abbey's lady mary and her lady's maid, anna bates, from finding a way to connect.\n\nthe most interesting part of this story is the relationship between the two worlds. mary has her most sisterly relationship with anna. she knows her better than anyone, michelle dockery (mary) says in a joint interview with joanne froggatt (anna) before the sixth and final season of pbs masterpiece's downton (sundays, 9 p.m. et/pt, check local listings). for me and jo, that's been a huge part of the experience, those scenes between the two of them.\n\nanna has a strong marriage to her downstairs colleague, mr. bates (brendan coyle), but she speaks most freely to mary.\n\nmary's been the one from the start that anna's always confided in, froggatt says. they really genuinely care for each other. anna won't hear a bad word said about lady mary, even though she's not always perfect.\n\nthat applies from the other direction, too, dockery says. a lot of the time, mary doesn't really care what other people think, especially the family. but it's important that she gets approval from anna.\n\nmary's relationship with her real sister, lady edith (laura carmichael), is fractious, leading to plenty of drama. there's some really great stuff between the sisters, especially late in the season, dockery says.\n\nwhile anna has a husband, the widowed lady mary, who has a young child, is seeking a new partner.\n\nit's complicated. she's a widow now, so her choices are different, because it's about finding a father for george as well, dockery says.\n\ndashing race-car driver henry talbot (matthew goode) is a candidate, although mary may not agree. that's the sort of guy she would have liked at the beginning, dockery says.  mary was a rebel. then her position gave her more responsibility, and she kind of became the person she didn't want to be.\n\nthere's a playful give and take between the two actors as they discuss swapping their downton roles.\n\ni definitely want the (upstairs) wardrobe, froggatt says.\n\ndockery cautions. sometimes, you're like, 'you can take it,'  because of all the costume changes during filming.\n\nfroggatt reconsiders: i'm so glad all i have to do is one fitting at the beginning of each season.\n\nand dockery decides she doesn't mind: . the outfit changes are always worth it, because they are knockout.\n\nthe period covered by masterpiece's downton – 1912 and through world war i to a technologically advanced 1925 – reflects massive change. you definitely feel those social changes, more so for the women, froggatt says. you feel there are starting to be more opportunities for women and for the working classes.\n\nnew opportunities greet the actors, too. dockery is set to play a thief and con artist in contemporary america in upcoming tnt drama good behavior, while froggatt will go back to the 19th century to play poisoner mary ann cotton in masterpiece's two-part dark angel.\n\nthey appreciate their downton fame, with each ending heading toward the march 6 series finale serving as a reminder.\n\nthe last day (shooting) at highclere castle was a big day, dockery says. that's when it really started to sink in.
keith uhlig\n\nusa today network-wisconsin\n\nmarshfield - sara guild's unborn baby died about halfway through her pregnancy.\n\nuntil that point in 2016, guild, outreach director for u.s. congressman sean duffy and a marathon county board member, and her husband, daniel guild, weston village administrator, were thinking about the future.\n\nby that stage, you are already planning a life around another member of your family, said sara guild, 33. after the doctor told her the news, she said she only had one thought: what did i do wrong?\n\nnothing. she took some solace when her doctor told her so. the baby likely died because its body got twisted up with the umbilical cord, her obstetrician said. it's the cause of an estimated 10 percent of stillbirths, according to research by the stillbirth collaborative research network.\n\nbut for many women who lose unborn babies, the reason isn't at all clear. and sometimes, there is no answer at all to a loss during pregnancy. not knowing what happened or why can add even more emotional pain to an already difficult grieving process.\n\nthat special kind of suffering spurred dr. elizabeth mcpherson and diane allingham-hawkins of preventiongenetics, a marshfield genetic testing lab, to band together to find a new, better way to determine the causes of pregnancy loss. mcpherson is a medical geneticist for the firm and director of the wisconsin stillbirth service program. allingham-hawkins is the senior laboratory director at preventiongenetics and a geneticist who specializes in the technical aspect of scrutinizing human dna.\n\ntogether, they and their colleagues at preventiongenetics unveiled in december a first-of-its-kind process of determining why unborn or just-born infants have died, called the comprehensive miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death panel.\n\ncouples who experience these kinds of challenges are compelled to seek answers to questions whether the event will happen again, and if it could have been prevented, mcpherson said. genetic testing can sometimes open the doors to answers.\n\nhow the test works\n\nthink of dna as a car engine. a skilled mechanic knows a good engine by the way it looks and sounds. when things go wrong, the mechanic can look at an engine and see oil seeping through a seal, find a cracked hose or hear a piston misfiring.\n\nit was only recently that researchers fully understood what a sound gene looked like. now they can use highly-refined equipment and testing procedures to look at dna of the child and see where things have gone wrong — like a mechanic does with an engine. the preventiongenetics testing panel uses genetic expertise and sophisticated technology developed over the past decade or so to identify dna deficiencies in the child that cause pregnancy loss.\n\nthe preventiongenetics lab itself isn't all the distinctive. it looks like a high-tech chemistry lab, full of equipment such as computers, monitors and machines that have a space-age, microwave or dishwasher kind of look. but the equipment is able to peer down into the sub-cell level and provide images of the genes that are the building blocks of life. geneticists then can use those images to determine genetic problems.\n\nthe preventiongenetic miscarriage panel is not just one simple test. it's a battery of tests that first scrutinizes for chromosome abnormalities (chromosomes are larger, and therefore easier to study). then, if the cause isn't found, the tests go deeper into the dna to scrutinize specific genes for problems, the most common first. in the past, all those tests were done individually. the preventiongenetic procedure is unique because it uses one cohesive process and can find genetic disorders more efficiently.\n\nmcpherson has three decades worth of experience working with patients and she has a deep understanding of the genetic problems that cause pregnancy loss. one of the reasons mcpherson specialized in genetics 30 years ago was because she foresaw how the study of the dna could impact the future of medicine. through her professional career, she has seen a science revolution in the field of genetics.\n\nin the 1980s and 1990s, we didn't know the genes and what they cause, mcpherson said.\n\nthe preventiongenetics comprehensive miscarriage, stillbirth & neonatal death panel is based at its very core on the work of the human genome project. begun in the 1990, the international scientific effort completed in 2003 the vast and intricate blueprint that provides the instructions for the development of a human being, according to the national human genome research institute.\n\nhuman dna contains the information that determines a cell's makeup and role in the human body. nearly every cell in a person contains a copy of the 3 billion dna pairs that make up the human genome.\n\nthe human genome project created a model, or map, of the entire sequence. that information gives medical researchers an understanding of the healthy dna. they use that information to find defective or deficient genetic factors that contribute to diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. and miscarriages.\n\nloss of pregnancy 'so common,' rarely discussed\n\nthousands of american families deal with a loss during pregnancy or death shortly after birth each year:\n\nmiscarriages, a pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks, occur in anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of all clinically-recognized pregnancies, according to the american pregnancy association, an organization that promotes pregnancy wellness.\n\nabout 24,000 stillbirths — defined as a loss 20 or more weeks after a woman becomes pregnant — were reported in the u.s. in 2013, or 1 percent of all pregnancies, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nneonatal death refers to the death of a live-born infant before the baby is 28 days old. precise statistics on neonatal deaths are difficult to find, but it affects about 4 million babies per year across the world, according to the world health organization.\n\nguild said it wasn't until she miscarried that she learned how prevalent pregnancy losses are. after her experience, friends, relatives and colleagues began to speak to her about their experiences.\n\nit is so common, guild said. and it's so rarely talked about.\n\na mother's guilt that she could be at fault is part of the reason for the taboo in discussing pregnancy loss, allingham-hawkins said.\n\nbut it's also often an unacknowledged loss, she said. people assume (because the baby hasn't been born) that (the mother) didn't connect with them. and that's just not true.\n\ndeveloping the test\n\nthe need for a new genetic testing panel became obvious to mcpherson when she became the director of the wisconsin stillbirth service program in 2009. that medical program was developed in 1983 to provide state services to families and health care providers across the state, with a focus on assessing why stillbirths happen in wisconsin.\n\nwhen she started working with the wisconsin stillbirth service, mcpherson also began to pore through the data compiled by the service, representing about 3,000 stillbirths and their causes. she looked for causes that would not be immediately apparent to an attending physician, but also were prevalent in the cases.\n\ni was searching for genetic diseases that might be missed on an autopsy, mcpherson said.\n\nabout half of early miscarriages, 25 percent of stillbirths and 20 percent of neonatal deaths can be traced back to abnormalities of the developing baby, and most of those have a genetic cause, according to preventiongenetics.\n\nmcpherson's and allingham-hawkins' skills meshed together well to create the testing panel for miscarriages.\n\n\n\nallingham-hawkins's specialty is knowing how to create the genetic tests that find those problems.\n\nmcpherson and allingham-hawkins' partnership was a perfect marriage. there was a mixture of clinical expertise with technical know-how, said christina zaleski, the preventiongenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\npersonal experience also motivated mcpherson and allingham-hawkins to develop the test. allingham-hawkins understands full well the pain of miscarriage — she's had two.\n\nand just after the testing panel was completed, another preventiongenetic colleague, angela gruber, a human molecular geneticist who is the director of the specimen processing department, lost her child in december, four months before she was due.\n\nas part of the grieving process, gruber named her late child rosemary, and she and her husband, ben gruber, a firefighter/paramedic, consented for rosemary's dna to be used to validate the testing panel and make sure it worked as designed.\n\ngruber still aches from the loss, but participating in the test development process helped ease some of the pain.\n\nknowing that our little girl was directly involved in the validation of the test that can help so many families is comforting, gruber said. for many families, getting an answer is closure, relief, and allows for you to be at peace with the situation.\n\nher connection with her unborn baby led gruber to allow a photographer to record the day rosemary was delivered. we sang songs, read books, and continue to hold her close to our hearts, gruber said.\n\nrosemary had trioplody, which is a chromosomal disorder which causes abnormal development and almost always causes pregnancy loss. it affects about 1 to 3 percent of all pregnancies.\n\nat my 12-week appointment things seemed off, and i had a mother's intuition that something was wrong, gruber said. it wasn't until our week 20 ultrasound that my fears and concerns were confirmed by a lot of life-threatening birth defects.\n\ngruber, an auburndale native who has earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the university of wisconsin-madison, understands more than most the genetic problems that can lead to miscarriage. plus she had the support of colleagues such as mcpherson and christina zaleski, the preventiongenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\neven before gruber lost rosemary, mcpherson diagnosed trioplody. in one sense, the diagnosis was a relief.\n\nwhen we first started to realize there was something not right with our little girl, my first concern was if my husband and i were carriers for a disorder. at least we know that this most likely was a random one-off event that shouldn't be something to worry about in future pregnancies, gruber said.\n\neven though gruber knew why rosemary didn't survive, using her dna to validate the test was a way to help others in a similar situation, zaleski said. (there's a) passion and desire here to bring answers to families experiencing a very deep and personal loss.\n\n'a really good tool'\n\nstillbirth often happens without any warning, said dr. maria mascola, a maternal and fetal medicine specialist who treats women with high-risk pregnancies for the marshfield clinic in marshfield. and it's not only devastating and perplexing for parents, but it's also important to them to find out why. ... that's such a natural reaction, of course.\n\nmascola estimates that she can ascertain causes for about a third to half of the stillbirths in her patients. that leaves a significant number left in doubt. the preventiongenetics panel can help determine hard-to-find causes in those cases, mascola said.\n\nsince learning about preventiongenetics' panel, mascola has ordered the testing to be done for two of her patients. she hasn't received results yet, but she believes in the process. that's because she's worked with mcpherson in the past and is confident in mcpherson's abilities.\n\ni don't think there's anybody better equipped than her to address this issue, mascola said. i think she's developed a really good tool.\n\nmcpherson worked with mascola as a geneticist with the marshfield clinic, and also as the director of the wisconsin stillbirth project.\n\nthe stillbirth project is an amazing, amazing resource in helping clinicians, hospitals and patients find out the causes of stillbirths. and as the director, mcpherson has expanded the knowledge base regarding miscarriages and stillbirths, helping create large databases that hospitals can use as resources, and because she has the deep genetic knowledge that doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology generally don't have.\n\ngenetics is a complicated world, and is becoming more complicated each day as new discoveries are being made, mascola said.\n\nthose new advances, such as the preventiongenetics miscarriage panel, are life changing.\n\nknowing what happened during a pregnancy carries the very essence of motherhood, said sara guild.\n\nas a mother, it's up to you to protect that child from the moment it develops, guild said. you're so emotionally invested from the moment of conception.\n\nkeith uhlig can be reached at 715-845-0651 or at keith.uhlig@gannettwisconsin.com. you can read more from him athttp://www.wausaudailyherald.com/staff/14865/keith-uhlig/ and find him on facebook or on twitter as@uhligk.
fredreka schouten and mary troyan\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — the alabama political scandal that has cost the state's governor his marriage and now threatens his job has thrust politicians' growing use of often-secretly funded nonprofits into the spotlight.\n\ngov. robert bentley's former aides created the tax-exempt alabama council for excellent government last year to promote the governor's agenda, but some of its funds went to pay the governor's senior political adviser, exposed in recent weeks as his extramarital love interest. and like any other social-welfare group created under the 501(c)(4) section of the tax code, it does not have to disclose its donors.\n\nnonprofit groups have become a fixture in federal politics, allowing secret donors to pump unlimited sums into advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in elections. but their use has spread rapidly to statehouses from lansing, mich., to nashville, tenn., and city halls from new york to los angeles, as another source of cash that elected officials of both parties can tap to help shape public policy.\n\nelected officials defend their use, saying nonprofits can move more nimbly than government agencies to advance civic initiatives and are less likely to draw the public's ire over using taxpayer funds for pet projects or quasi-political expenses, such as polling. campaign-finance watchdogs, however, said they are just another way for unregulated money to seep into the political process and give big donors a back-door method to curry favor with decision makers.\n\nthe c4 world was created for social-welfare opportunities, to help hospitals and food banks and the like provide services to people, said edwin bender, an expert on campaign money who runs the national institute on money in state politics in helena, mont. the fact they have morphed into political slush funds is certainly against the spirit of the (tax) code.\n\nin michigan, a tax-exempt group operated by gov. rick snyder's supporters is helping to underwrite the republican's public relations campaign to cope with the flint water contamination crisis. the group, moving michigan forward, discloses its donors and reported taking in nearly $300,000 during the first three months of this year. most of the money came from another snyder-linked non-profit, making government accountable. that group does not make its donors' identities public, said snyder spokesman ari adler.\n\nasked whether the fundraising gave donors a behind-the-scenes opportunity to build relationships with the governor, adler said: you could also look at it, though, that there are people who want to help in flint and may not necessarily want to be out there cutting a check and making it public because they don't want the publicity.\n\nobama to visit flint, prompted by 8-year-old's letter\n\nin los angeles, democratic mayor eric garcetti helped establish a nonprofit, mayor's fund for los angeles, to raise funds for his initiatives, ranging from a public campaign to encourage city residents to reduce their water usage to a program that keeps parks and recreation centers open after dark during the summer months. it raised $14.6 million in its first full fiscal year, drawing support from philanthropic groups such as the anheuser-busch foundation, to companies such as goldman sachs and paramount pictures, according to its website.\n\ngarcetti has said he has no control over the fund, which he describes on the website as a public-private partnership that enables the nimbleness of private enterprise to meet the scale of city government.\n\nthis year, allies of another big-city mayor, new york's bill de blasio, began disbanding campaign for one new york, a nonprofit group created to advance his agenda on issues, such as universal pre-kindergarten. the group, whose donors have included individuals and companies with businesses before the city, had drawn sharp criticism from government watchdogs who claimed it amounted to a shadow government, operating outside of campaign-finance rules that bar corporate donations to mayoral candidates. the group discloses its donors.\n\nthe nonprofit now appears to be part of a sprawling federal and state investigation into the democrat's fundraising practices. this week, the wall street journal reported that jad corporation of america, a company that received a new york city contract to buy its mint-scented garbage bags that repel rodents, received a subpoena from authorities looking into de blasio's affairs. the company's owner, joseph dussich, had donated $100,000 to campaign for one new york.\n\nde blasio has denied any wrongdoing and has said the nonprofit is shutting down because its work is done. dussich did not return telephone calls, and an official with the u.s. attorney's office of the southern district of new york declined comment.\n\nin tennessee, gov. bill haslam's former campaign manager formed tennesseans for student success in october 2014 to defend haslam's education policies, including running ads supporting like-minded legislators. this year, the 501(c)(4) announced it will spend $500,000 on an aggressive ground, air and data operation to support the policies that have led tennessee to become the fastest improving state in the nation in education and hired a field director with experience on state and federal political campaigns. it does not disclose donors.\n\nthe practice also has reached the highest levels of government.\n\nin 2013, president obama became the first sitting president to launch nonprofit advocacy group to lobby for his agenda. the group, organizing for action, reported $40.4 million in revenue during its two years of operation, according to its most recent filings with the irs. the tax-exempt group does not accept corporate money or donations from federal lobbyists and voluntarily discloses all contributions larger than $250 on its website. ofa has advocated for everything from obama's push to overhaul the criminal-justice system to urging the republican-controlled senate to take action on his supreme court nominee, merrick garland.\n\nlike obama, the 501(c)(4) in alabama promoting bentley's agenda was formed at the beginning of his second term, with two of the governor's former aides listed as incorporators. during the state legislative session that followed in early 2015, the alabama council for excellent government touted the republican's unsuccessful $541 million tax and revenue package.\n\nduring that same time, the group paid $15,000 to rcm communications, a consulting firm run by rebekah mason, the adviser now at the heart of the scandal involving the governor. mason resigned after recordings of their romantic phone conversations became public in march.\n\nalabama governor took alleged paramour to formal white house dinner\n\nthe investigations have just begun into whether the arrangement — having a top adviser to the governor paid by private sources — violated alabama's ethics laws. at least two lawsuits are seeking information about the finances of the organization, and some lawmakers are calling for bentley's impeachment amid questions about whether state resources were misused.\n\nrebekah was paid by a campaign fund that we don't know who contributed to, and that just don't pass the smell test, said state rep. jim patterson, a republican lawmaker in alabama who introduced legislation barring anyone paid using undisclosed, private money from working for the state.\n\nmason herself disclosed the alabama council for excellent government's payment to her consulting firm, but the group has not publicly identified any of its donors and has not fully disclosed how it has spent its money. it is run by bentley's former legal adviser, cooper shattuck, who is now general counsel for the university of alabama system.\n\nin the wake of the bentley scandal, shattuck told usa today that he has contacted the group's donors and none has agreed to allow their identities to be revealed. the alabama council for excellent government has not yet filed a tax return with the irs, but shattuck said the group has raised about $123,000 and spent almost $81,000 since march 2015.\n\nshattuck said using a tax-exempt group makes sense because it can make expenditures that help further a governor's agenda that some feel are more appropriately paid with private funds, such as polling and digital media advertising.

mark curnutte\n\nthe cincinnati enquirer\n\ncincinnati — amid u.s. immigration officials' efforts to send a young man thousands of miles away, he and his fiancee are trying to tie the knot.\n\nan ohio sheriff is blocking it.\n\nmorrow county sheriff john l. hinton said he will not allow the jailhouse marriage of one of his federal prisoners, yancarlos mendez of springdale, to the mother of a paraplegic boy because it needs to go through u.s. immigration and customs enforcement first.\n\neven then, hinton said, the decision about whether to let the marriage take place would ultimately be his.\n\nwe haven't allowed any in the past, hinton told the enquirer.\n\nmore:despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'daddy' to be deported\n\nmore:paraplegic 6-year-old's 'daddy' faces deportation\n\nmendez, a native of the dominican republic with dual spanish citizenship, has a final deportation order. however, the 6th circuit court of appeals, which granted a temporary stay of deportation last week to determine if it had jurisdiction, on thursday set a schedule for going forward with the case. the dates stretch into april.\n\nin the meantime, mendez will remain jailed in morrow county, north of columbus.\n\nsandra mendoza and mendez have planned to get married since february, but they were consumed with the around-the-clock medical needs of her son, ricky solis, 6, who is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nricky remains hospitalized at cincinnati children's hospital because of abdominal bleeding. he sustained serious bowel, bladder and colon injuries in a february auto crash. he needs surgery.\n\nattorney nazly mamedova said that legal precedent exists that prevents jailers or sheriffs from denying a prisoner's legal right to marry. she said she requested permission wednesday and was told by a deputy that the sheriff does not allow inmate marriages.\n\nthe u.s. supreme court ruled in a 1987 missouri case — turner v. safley — that preventing inmates from marrying violates their constitutional rights. mamedova said the precedent has been affirmed in other cases by the court that a fundamental right to marriage exists under the fourteenth amendment.\n\nthe sheriff said he is not aware of such case law.\n\ni'd take a look at it, hinton said\n\nice wants to deport mendez because it says he violated terms of the visa waiver program, which is how he entered the united states from spain. he overstayed the 90-day visa, ice said.\n\nhis attorneys said mendez is the sole provider for mendoza and ricky and, with mendoza, was trained to provide specialized medical care to ricky in the family's springdale apartment.\n\ntheirs is not the only immigration case on which the 6th circuit has ruled in the past week. on wednesday, it ordered the u.s. board of immigration appeal to reconsider evidence in the deportation case of maribel trujillo-diaz. the fairfield mother of four was deported to mexico in april.
would a real oscar front-runner please stand up?\n\nwith less than two weeks until the academy awards on feb. 9 (abc, 8 p.m. et/5 pt), it has become painfully obvious who's taking all the acting gold but not so much what's going home with the big prize: best picture. this awards season has spread the love around, giving every major film contender a time to shine and every person in an oscar pool a chance to chew on his or her nails.\n\nthrowing other wrenches into the works: best picture is voted on through a preferential ballot, where academy members rank their choices rather than just pick one winner, plus a voting body that is slowly getting younger and more diverse every year.\n\nbest picture:15 films that didn't deserve the oscar – and the ones that should have won instead\n\noscar tally: here are the films and actors leading the race\n\nwhile one movie hasn't risen to rule them all quite yet, some have been left in the dust. the racing drama ford v ferrari may win some technical awards but that's it, the best chances for coming-of-age adaptation little women and divorce drama marriage story are in the screenplay categories, and the world war ii satire jojo rabbit looms as a dark horse with key guild nominations but has yet to make a splash this season.\n\nhere are the five, though, with the right resumes to conquer the best-picture race on oscar night:\n\n'1917'\n\nthe closest thing to a favorite is director sam mendes' world war i thriller, about two british soldiers (george mackay and dean-charles chapman) racing to deliver orders in time to save 1,600 fellow military men. the film has had big wins at the directors guild awards and producers guild awards, the latter a strong predictor for the oscars: the pga honoree has gone on to win best picture 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years with the shape of water and green book. also in its favor is a golden globe victory for best drama and an impressive box office, scoring $104 million with only a few weeks of nationwide release. one troublesome statistic remains: 1917 doesn't have an acting nomination, and only 11 films in oscar history – most recently slumdog millionaire in 2009 – have won best picture without one.\n\n'parasite'\n\nthe oscars have gone 91 years without awarding the academy of motion picture arts and sciences' highest honor to a foreign-language film, so history is not exactly on the side of south korean filmmaker bong joon-ho's acclaimed black comedy about class and social inequality. there is real love in the industry for parasite, however, evidenced by the crowd eruption when it snagged a surprise win for outstanding ensemble at the screen actors guild awards. with actors being the largest voting bloc in the academy, the victory – plus an honor for best drama given by the american cinema editors – gives parasite momentum going forward, though like 1917, it also has the problem of no oscar acting nominations.\n\n'once upon a time in hollywood'\n\nquentin tarantino's star-packed tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (leonardo dicaprio), his steely stuntman (brad pitt) and the manson family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. once upon a time won best comedy at the golden globes and best picture at the critics' choice awards, it's a strong contender in the 10 oscar categories where it's nominated (pitt's pretty much a lock for supporting actor and tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the academy awards since their inception have always adored movies about hollywood. this one has it right in the title.\n\n'the irishman'\n\nmartin scorsese's netflix gangster epic came into oscars like a heavyweight, but like a star is born last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. the film, which tracks world war ii veteran and mob hitman frank sheeran (robert de niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. still, don't count out the irishman yet: crime dramas tend to do well at the oscars (scorsese's the departed marked his first and only best picture in 2007), netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a hollywood favorite – not only scorsese and de niro, but also supporting-actor nominees al pacino and joe pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.\n\n'joker'\n\nof course the oscars' biggest wild card is the one with the iconic comic-book supervillain. joaquin phoenix seems destined to win best actor for his unnerving transformation from mentally unstable outcast to face-painted nihilist in todd phillips' psychological thriller origin story. the film's chances for best picture aren't as good as in other categories – such as original score and hair/makeup – but joker leads with the most oscar nominations (11 total). like irishman, it might also be helped by the preferential ballot, plus the controversial joker has made enough money ($334.6 million domestically, $1.1 billion worldwide) that it can't be ignored.

as david's bridal was toppling toward chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, the nation's largest wedding retailer took careful steps to show it was not leaving couples at the altar.\n\nthe company made sure customers knew it wasn't planning to close stores or cancel orders, unlike alfred angelo bridal, whose 2017 bankruptcy culminated in a chaotic liquidation that temporarily left many brides-to-be without dresses.\n\ndavid's bridal succeeded in using bankruptcy to slash burdensome debt it had acquired through a private-equity buyout years ago. the chain emerged from bankruptcy with more sustainable finances on jan. 18.\n\nbut the company's challenges aren't over. with digital threats emerging, marriage rates declining and wedding alternatives proliferating, david's bridal is adjusting its business to stay competitive.\n\nthe company has lowered prices on many of its bridesmaids' dresses, added more plus-size options and guaranteed free one-on-one consulting for brides-to-be.\n\ndavid's bridal ceo scott key recently spoke with usa today money reporter nathan bomey. excerpts from their conversation (condensed and edited for space and clarity):\n\nquestion: how did the bankruptcy affect the business? did it leave a mark?\n\ndavid's bridal ceo scott key: relative to the other 50 or so retail bankruptcies in the last couple years, our process was very clean, highly consensual and supported by our lender group. and very quick.\n\nthe news about david's entering bankruptcy – for some people that gets interpreted as david's is going away, and that's clearly not the case. we've come out the end a much stronger company.\n\nwe had work to do in communicating that david's is here to stay and in a healthy position, and we have been doing that.\n\nq: did you see a measurable impact on your sales?\n\na: that's non-public at this point, but what i would say is that it is important that we reach out to brides in the market and let them know that david's is there for them and they can trust us. this business is built on trust, and they have to know that's part of the equation.\n\nwe were clear with our brides that dresses that were on order would be delivered on time, and we were clear with our vendors that they would be paid through the process and there would be no impact to them in that regard, that our stores would remain open, that our employees would remain harmless.\n\nwe kept all of those promises.\n\nq: so many retail bankruptcies in the lastcouple years end up in a lot of stores being closed. you didn't take that approach. why did you choose not to take that approach, and going forward what will your store footprint look like?\n\na: you're right, we didn't shed a bunch of stores. and that is because we're actually in an advantageous position relative to most retailers. i think our fleet in the united states is appropriately sized, and our real estate choices have been well made in terms of the economics.\n\nthat said, i believe we have a significant opportunity to improve the customer experience in our stores and have been working to do so, with early steps being the introduction of a one-to-one service model.\n\nq: what does that entail?\n\na: in the past, in a busy, peak period … brides-to-be might find themselves in a situation where they're sharing the attention of the associate with another bride. and that was a dissatisfier for our customers.\n\n(now) brides have the attention of a dedicated bridal stylist.\n\nq: does someone have to pay for that?\n\na: no, it's free.\n\nq: does that mean you had to do some hiring or shifting people around?\n\na: we actually reworked things. we created the bridal stylist, which is the most experienced of the staff we have in stores, and then what we call a dress specialist, which handles the bridesmaids and special-occasion side of the business.\n\nq: you've lowered prices on some of your best-selling dresses. what's happening there?\n\na: that's true in a number of categories, but it's particularly true in bridesmaids' (dresses). it's in response to us understanding better the competitive forces in the marketplace.\n\nif you look in the online space, where the bridesmaids' business is the most competitive, you'll find other players have … figured out how to deliver them at a lower price. to be competitive, we need to be at parity with price, and so we made those adjustments.\n\nwe also introduced a new line of product. if you were to take the good-better-best spectrum of bridesmaids' (dresses), we amplified the good end of the spectrum and made those available online.\n\nq: is there a figure to quantify the price difference of bridesmaids' dresses overall at david's bridal?\n\na: no. i would say it's taken on case by case. some were priced perfectly, some were perhaps north of what's competitive, and in some instances there might be some that were below.\n\nq: is it correct to say you're offering more, larger sizes now?\n\na: it's not as much about the size run itself as it is the number of choices that are available in those sizes. david's is an open and inclusive brand, and we support many women with plus-sized needs and petite-sized needs.\n\nwhen a plus-sized woman would visit our store, she would likely be able to try on a dress in her size, which is different than the experience if she visited (a) boutique, but it might not be the dress she wanted.\n\nbasically we are … supporting women of all sizes and giving them an opportunity to try on a dress in their size.\n\nq: are you concerned at all about this surge of online competition and the effect it could have on your business?\n\na: if you look at market share today, the reality is that the majority of the units and the sales happen in physical retail locations. but as is true of every other category of retail, that will change over time.\n\nwe see that first pivot happening in the bridesmaids' category, but over time that will shift into the gown, too.\n\nso we are very focused on improving our digital customer experience and have a project going on that front.\n\nthink of online as the future and stores as the present.

pyeongchang, south korea — not all triumphs come with a medal.\n\ngus kenworthy leaves the pyeongchang olympics empty-handed, failing to land a run in the slopestyle final sunday. but his heart is full, knowing what he did here is far bigger than sport. in the evolution of societal attitudes toward gays and lesbians, kenworthy and adam rippon's participation here will be a watershed moment.\n\nit's not simply that they are the first openly gay athletes to represent the united states at the winter olympics. it's that they became two of the biggest american stars at these games simply by being their authentic selves.\n\nthe only way to really change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation, kenworthy said sunday afternoon.\n\nmore:adam rippon will work for nbc as a correspondent\n\nmore:nick goepper, gus kenworthy can inspire others by sharing stories\n\nfour years ago, kenworthy wanted so badly to kiss his then-boyfriend after winning the silver medal in sochi, but couldn't work up the nerve to do it. he hadn't come out yet, either publicly or to his family, and he was petrified of the reaction.\n\nnone of that crossed his mind sunday when he kissed boyfriend matt wilkas before his first run, a moment shown during nbc's prime-time coverage.\n\nit's positive. it's great. the exposure to that is a great thing for our community, wilkas said. but, also, part of me thinks, `well, big deal.' it was the tiniest kiss in the world.\n\nbut there are still places in the world where daring to be yourself is dangerous, where being gay can get you killed. there are politicians in our own country, the president and vice president chief among them, who view members of the lgbtq community as being somehow less, and promote policies that have no other objective than to marginalize them.\n\nso to see kenworthy and his boyfriend act like any other couple, to be treated like any heterosexual couple, it speaks volumes. so, too, to see rippon being embraced from hollywood to the heartland.\n\nit tells bigots whose hate is rooted in fear and ignorance that gays and lesbians pose no threat. it tells children who are gay and worried about what that will mean for them that they're ok and their sexuality will not define or limit them.\n\nit is yet one more step in the road to true equality.\n\nto see somebody like this who is unashamed, unafraid … it's game-changing. it's life-changing. it's reaffirming, said tyler oakley, a youtube host and lgbtq activist who has become friends with kenworthy and called him and rippon possibility models.\n\nto see somebody celebrated when they're often used to being disenfranchised, it's a flip of the script.\n\nwhile kenworthy and rippon are proud of who they are and are willing standard bearers for the lgbtq community, they look forward to the day when their sexual orientation is irrelevant. when they, or those who follow them, are known as athletes who happen to be gay rather than gay athletes.\n\nbut for that day to come, society will have to rid itself of its prejudices and fears. and there is no better way to speed that process along than when people like kenworthy and rippon are embraced by mainstream america.\n\ngus was worried before he came out that he would lose his fan base, said his father, peter. i said, `you never know. you might gain a whole other fan base.' which is exactly what happened.\n\nit's worth remembering that, during the sochi games, gay marriage was still about a year and a half from being legal throughout the united states. attitudes have undergone a significant shift since then, as more and more people realize just how conventional gays and lesbians are.\n\nthey are accountants and bricklayers, teachers and clergy, actors and attorneys. they are moms and dads, husbands and wives. they are your family members, co-workers, neighbors and friends.\n\nand, yes, they are people to be emulated and cheered.\n\ni was trying to remind myself that win or lose, i still have a lot to be proud of, kenworthy said.\n\nkenworthy leaves these games without a medal, but he won something much bigger. more tolerance and acceptance, both for himself and the entire lgbtq community.\n\n***\n\nfollow usa today sports columnist nancy armour on twitter @nrarmour.
washington – as president joe biden tells it, the nuns who taught the future president based their religious instruction on the gospel of matthew: whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\n\nthat tenet was echoed during his first days in office, when biden signed orders to ensure fair treatment for marginalized groups on housing and other issues.\n\nwe're all god's children, biden said. we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.\n\nanother of his earliest actions strengthened anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. on thursday, biden was expected to sign a memorandum to protect the rights of lgbtq people worldwide, including providing protections to gay and lesbian refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nbut what to biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep catholic faith appears to some christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the trump administration. those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.\n\nit absolutely is a direct conflict with trump's approach, said history professor john fea, author of believe me: the evangelical road to donald trump.\n\nstark contrast to trump white house\n\nbiden, only the second catholic president, has brought to the white house a different approach to faith, both personally and through policy.\n\nunlike trump, biden regularly attends church. his catholicism has played as large a role in his life as his outsized family bible did at his inauguration. biden wears his son's rosary beads, made the sign of the cross when paying his respects to fallen capitol police officer brian sicknick tuesday, and quotes bible passages.\n\nthe contrast couldn't be starker, said john carr, co-director of the initiative on catholic social thought and public life at georgetown university. we're going from one of the least overtly religious presidents in modern times to one of the most overtly religious presidents in recent history.\n\nthe difference is already clear in policy.\n\ntrump was a hero to the little sisters of the poor, an order of nuns running homes for the elderly, which challenged the federal requirement that insurance plans cover birth control. at trump's renominating convention, a nun from the little workers of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary questioned biden's religion and called trump the most pro-life president.\n\nbiden is praised by sister simone campbell, executive director of network lobby for catholic social justice, who spoke at the democratic national convention about caring for all of god's creations. she's thrilled by biden's efforts to expand health care coverage, address racism and reverse trump's anti-immigration actions.\n\none of the ways that he's living out his faith is by centering the issues of equity at the heart of his administration, which i find super-exciting, she said. it's never happened before.\n\nadvancing the 'common good'\n\nbiden has not yet announced a faith-based adviser or created a faith outreach office. but he has declared that advancing equity has to be everyone's job.\n\nbiden's focus on the common good is a central concept of the centuries-old catholic social tradition, massimo faggioli wrote in the new book joe biden and catholicism in the united states.\n\nin remarks to the national prayer breakfast on thursday, biden said his faith provides hope and solace, clarity and purpose.\n\nit shows the way forward, as one nation in a common purpose, to respect one another, to care for one another, to leave no one behind, he said.\n\nnational prayer breakfast:biden urges a turn to faith at event notable for absence of trump\n\nbut biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the catholic church between pope francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing. (a photo of biden with francis was among the personal photos arrayed behind biden when, sitting at his desk in the oval office, he took steps last week to expand health insurance access and to allow federally funded family planning groups to provide or refer patients for abortion services.)\n\nwe are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, biden said in a joint statement with vice president kamala harris last month recognizing the 48th anniversary of the supreme court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion.\n\nfar from creating a more equitable society, christian conservatives say, biden's actions are reverse discrimination – particularly his first-day move to ensure workplace and other protections for people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nwith a stroke of a pen, president joe biden has turned 50-year-old civil rights legislation on its head, hollowing out protections for people of faith, family research council president tony perkins said in a statement.\n\ntrump's strongest supporters\n\nwhite evangelical protestants were trump's strongest supporters, according to the pew research center. that's despite trump having been one of the least religious to ever run for the presidency.\n\nbut trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail that the first priority of my administration will be to preserve and protect our religious liberty. religious freedom became a signature issue of both his domestic and foreign policy.\n\nrecent cultural and demographic changes have made evangelicals feel not only that the idea of america as a christian nation is under siege but that their own liberty is being threatened, said fea, who teaches history at messiah college in mechanicsburg, pa.\n\ntrump provided the kind of fighter, the strong man, to protect their interests, he said.\n\nthe feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in pew research center surveys. in a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the gop said that religion is losing influence in american life and that this is a bad thing. a 2020 survey suggests that republicans who have experienced some form of harassment online are more likely than democrats to say they believe their religion was a reason.\n\nwe live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault, then-vice president mike pence told liberty university graduates in 2019. during the trump administration, pence's strong faith-based views on abortion and homosexuality made him a target of democratic criticism, including from those seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination. biden had to backtrack after being lambasted by progressives and lgbtq activists for calling pence a decent guy.\n\nthere is nothing decent about being anti-lgbtq rights, and that includes the vice president, biden tweeted.\n\nbiden's own positions on gay marriage and abortion evolved over the years. after voting to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages 16 years earlier, he backed legalizing gay marriage in 2012 – jumping out ahead of president barack obama in his announcement.\n\nbiden has become a strong supporter of roe v. wade and, in 2019, reversed his support for a longstanding provision that bans federal funding for most abortions.\n\nrabbi hara person, head of the central conference of american rabbis, said she's encouraged that biden is not imposing his faith-based opposition to abortion on others.\n\nreligious liberty means not only freedom to practice our faith as we see fit, but it's also freedom from having the religious views of others imposed on us, she said. that was something that was really missing these last four years.\n\ncarr, of the initiative on catholic social thought and public life, said he backed biden, in spite of biden's going along with the extremism of the democratic party on abortion.\n\ni think character matters, competence matters and treating people with respect matters, carr said. lifting up the poor and vulnerable matters, and trump failed those tests for me.\n\nbut carr is waiting to see what biden will prioritize.\n\nis it going to be overcoming covid, bringing us together, caring for creation? or is it going to be sort of a culture war? he asked. i think what biden campaigned on, and who he is, is pursuing justice in unity – not a culture war agenda.\n\ncarr, who in a former role with the u.s. conference of catholic bishops helped develop their documents on political responsibilities of catholics, recently organized a discussion of how biden's catholicism affects his presidency and the role its playing in the divide within the church.\n\nthe split was highlighted when pope francis' congratulatory message to biden on inauguration day emphasized respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable, and those who have no voice.\n\nissuing his own statement, the president of the u.s. conference of catholic bishops warned that biden has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.\n\nof deep concern is the liberty of the church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences, wrote los angeles archbishop josé gomez.\n\nbiden's presidency could contribute to the difficult realignment of american catholicism with pope francis's vision – a process resisted by `culture war' bishops since the time of francis's election, but also interrupted by trump, faggioli wrote in his book on biden and catholicism. the mere possibility of such a realignment will being a lot of attention to this particular catholic moment.\n\nmore broadly, there's a stark divide along religious lines on whether people see the united states as having an essential culture and values that immigrants take on or whether it's a nation made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, according to daniel cox, director of the survey center on american life.\n\nwhite christians – including white evangelical protestants and white mainline catholics – believe the u.s. has a central culture, surveys show. the majority of everyone else believe culture and values adjust, cox said.\n\nthat's a fundamentally different conception of the country and where it ought to be headed, cox said.\n\nbiden will have to take that into account as he tries to weave together the disparate groups that make up his coalition and fulfill a central campaign promise – one that's also rooted in his faith – of bringing the country together.\n\ni think, cox said, that's really going to be challenge.

adam rippon isn't a hulking football player like michael sam. he's not a 7-foot basketball center like jason collins. he's dissimilar from robbie rogers, a soccer player whose recent retirement from mls left zero openly gay men in major professional sports in the u.s.\n\nthe fact that he happens to have come out as gay and did so as an active athlete is about the only thing that links rippon to some of the more masc sports figures who courageously came out over the years — and that's part of his appeal.\n\ni think it's huge that he does not project the way other professional athletes have when it comes to masculinity, anthony nicodemo, a high school basketball coach in new york and lgbtq activist, told usa today sports. he marches to the beat of his own drum the way somebody like michael (sam) and jason (collins) didn't. they fit that piece of masculinity we have come to expect in sports being big and strong. adam doesn't fit into that box.\n\nrippon became the first openly gay u.s. figure skater to compete in the olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided team usa's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition monday. eric radford then became the first openly gay figure skater to win an olympic gold medal as he and meagan duhamel helped canada win the team figure skating event.\n\nthere are 15 lgbtq athletes competing in pyeongchang -- including rippon and gus kenworthy (skiing) from team usa --- per outsports.com. there were seven in sochi four years ago.\n\nit's an awesome time, mason darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of princeton's football team, told usa today sports. for the lack of a better word, it's a gay olympics. i think it's (a) really nice change of pace.\n\nrippon, 28, certainly hasn't shied from embracing who he is on the international stage -- and that included criticizing vice president mike pence's views on the lgbt issues in an interview with usa today sports last month.\n\nbeing here at the olympics does give me a louder voice, rippon said earlier this week. it has given me a platform. it's given me a voice to reach to young kids. i've gotten so many messages i could even get emotional thinking about it, but i've gotten so many messages from young kids all over the country that my story's resonated with them. it's incredibly powerful this platform that you can have at the olympic games.\n\nrippon declined to speak with pence, who attended the opening ceremony last week, before the figure skating competition began, usa today sports' christine brennan reported.\n\nthe bravery and courage he has is amazing, austin parrish, a former swimmer who came out in high school before competing collegiately at eastern illinois, told usa today sports. i personally love that he is taking on mike pence. i'm from indiana, where pence was my governor while i was a college athlete. i never felt supported by the politicians of indiana or the support for being an openly gay athlete. the way pence rejected marriage equality in indiana brought several emotions to the surface.\n\nrippon has regularly -- on social media and in interviews -- talked about what it means to be an openly gay elite athlete.\n\nbeing true to who you are and not giving a (expletive) about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not, rippon wrote on twitter earlier this week. sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, like, everyone should try it, for real. just do it.\n\nrippon is hardly the first gay male figure skater, a sport that has seen gold medalist brian boitano, rudy galindoand nbc broadcaster johnny weir among the american skaters who have come out. however, they made that choice later in their careers or after their respective retirements.\n\ni definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when i was a young gay kid, said darrow, who now works for the cleveland indians. i think most young gay boys did something of the sort. i think adam is definitely easier to relate to on that front than somebody like a (football player) like i was.\n\nrippon scored 87.95 in the short program thursday night, putting him 7th out of 21 competitors and tops among the three team usa skaters. he remains a long shot to medal in the men's individual competition as the free skate takes place friday night, although nicodemo said much of lgbtq community has taken in and appreciated all that rippon has accomplished so far.\n\nthe interesting thing with adam is that he's been embraced by the lgbt majority more than most out athletes, nicodemo said. i think he's a lot of us who go brunching on sundays and wear glitter. they see themselves in adam even if they can't skate.\n\nfollow a.j. perez on twitter @byajperez
gerald friedman\n\nopinion contributor\n\nthere is an instinct among political pundits to confuse caution for practicality — an assumption that those who advocate for incremental change are being reasonable, while those pushing for bold reforms aren't. this is seen most starkly in the debate around health care reform, despite the fact that the practical pushers of limited reform fail to address the real problems in our health care system.\n\nwe all recognize that the status quo isn't working. we spend more per person than any other country on health care, but we aren't getting any bang for our buck. we have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality rates and more preventable deaths, and too many personal bankruptcies are due at least in part to medical bills.\n\nwhere we disagree is the solution. the favorite new reasonable plan is medicare for america, a bill from reps. jan schakowsky and rosa delauro that has won the support of big names like texas presidential hopeful beto o'rourke and the center for american progress, the left-of-center think tank where the plan originated as medicare extra for all. it has been extolled in opinion pieces for some of america's largest newspapers as a realistic plan to fix what's broken in our health care system.\n\nread more commentary:\n\ndemocrats' promise of medicare for all is remarkably misguided and unrealistic\n\ntrump wants to drop a neutron bomb on obamacare. over to you, 2020 voters.\n\ntake it from me, tweaks won't fix health care. dems should focus on medicare for all.\n\non the other side, if punditry is to be believed, there are the medicare for all hard-liners who believe in expanding a significantly improved medicare system to every american, with coverage that includes dental, vision and long-term care. this is portrayed as radical or even unreasonable.\n\ntime to get real. as an economist who has spent decades studying our health care system, i can tell you that medicare for all advocates are the only ones who are being reasonable, because theirs is the only plan that will control health care costs while finally achieving universal coverage.\n\ninsurance companies are middle men\n\nthe problem with incremental plans, whether they are public options, buy-ins to medicare or medicaid, or pumping more money into subsidies in the affordable care act's individual marketplace, is that they preserve the private health insurance system weighing down our health care.\n\nthis may be why pundits and centrist politicians view those plans as reasonable, but it means that they are leaving the main reason for our system's dysfunction in place: the multipayer, for-profit financing model.\n\ncommercial insurance companies are nothing more than middle men. they add no value to our system, but they do drive up costs with their bloated claims departments, marketing and advertising budgets and executive salaries. we pay for all of these things before a single dollar is spent on the delivery of care.\n\nthey also create extra costs for providers who need large administrative staffs to deal with billing systems, accounting for as much as $100,000 per physician.\n\nany plans short of medicare for all leaves these costs in place. in other words, they leave hundreds of billions of dollars a year in savings on the table.\n\nmedicare for all attacks costs\n\nthe waste goes beyond administrative savings. while pharmaceutical companies and hospital groups are consolidating and forming regional monopolies, our fragmented, multipayer system leaves no one insurance plan with a large enough share of the market to negotiate effectively. that allows these companies to essentially set their own inflated prices and bilk the public for hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nis it any wonder that they oppose medicare for all?\n\nif we're talking about which health care reform plans are serious about attacking cost, providing universal coverage and making sure everyone has access to health care, medicare for all is the only reasonable answer. no other plan does this effectively, which is why i suspect that the center for american progress has not come out with spending estimates. basic economic tenets tell us that their plan will not reduce health care spending as effectively.\n\nis medicare for all bold? absolutely. is it reasonable? you bet. it is time to accept that medicare for all is the practical alternative.\n\ngerald friedman, a health care and labor economist, is an economics professor at university of massachusetts amherst and the director of the hopbrook institute. follow him on twitter: @gfriedma
the tennessean\n\npresident donald trump focused his nashville speech wednesday on repealing obamacare and on school choice. you can watch it in the player above.\n\ntrump timed his campaign-style rally at municipal auditorium to coincide with the 250th birthday of andrew jackson, which is one reason why he's visiting nashville. as part of his visit, trump plans to visit the hermitage and lay a wreath at jackson's tomb, the white house confirmed monday.\n\nthe health care component of the speech was to be expected because trump and house republicans are pushing a bill dubbed the american health care act to replace obamacare.\n\nnashville has been ground zero for debate about school choice. the expansion of publicly funded, privately run charter schools has defined the last three local school board races. and in the state legislature, bills to bring school vouchers are under debate. trump's secretary of education betsy devos is an ardent champion of charter schools and vouchers, which give parents public dollars to send their children to private schools.
washington – former president barack obama, who remained neutral for the entirety of the 2020 democratic primary, endorsed his former vice president, joe biden, on tuesday.\n\ni'm so proud to endorse joe biden for president of the united states, obama said in a nearly 12-minute video statement. choosing joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions i ever made, and he became a close friend. and i believe joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.\n\nobama said he is going to hit the campaign trail for biden as soon as i can.\n\nbiden tweeted shortly after obama's remarks became public, saying the endorsement means the world to jill and me.\n\nwe're going to build on the progress we made together, and there's no one i'd rather have standing by my side, biden said.\n\nobama had stayed mum on endorsing a candidate throughout the democratic primary, saying voters must pick the nominee. after sen. bernie sanders suspended his campaign last week, the primary election effectively came to an end, and biden is the presumptive democratic nominee.\n\nthere have been questions for months about when or if obama would weigh in on the primary, especially during the early state primary and caucus contests in which biden placed lower than anticipated.\n\nobama, who tied with president donald trump for the most admired man in america in a gallup poll this year, is the most popular democrat, according to yougov. he had large support among young voters, a group that biden has struggled to reach throughout the primary cycle. obama's endorsement could help the former vice president grow support among that voting bloc and encourage young voters to turn out.\n\npoll:joe biden leads donald trump by 8 points; majority say us is in a recession\n\naccording to polling and election data, biden has overwhelming support from black voters. some black voters pointed to his history of support for their community and his relationship with obama. biden has received the endorsement of several black leaders, such as rep. jim clyburn, d-s.c., and civil rights icon rep. john lewis, d-ga.\n\ni know joe biden as a man of character and dignity, lewis said in his endorsement statement. a man who cannot, and will not rest when he sees injustice in our american home.\n\nthroughout the campaign, biden has invoked obama's legacy, noting that he would build on the affordable care act, colloquially called obamacare. the health care legislation is one of the obama's biggest accomplishments as president.\n\nas the usa reels from the coronavirus pandemic, biden touted his and obama's efforts when they were in office to keep ebola from overwhelming the country.\n\nduring his endorsement remarks, obama referred to the coronavirus pandemic and highlighted biden's work during the h1n1 and ebola outbreaks.\n\njoe helped me manage h1n1 and prevent the ebola epidemic from becoming the type of pandemic we're seeing now, obama said. he helped me restore america's standing and leadership in the world on the other threats of our time, like nuclear proliferation and climate change.\n\nobama tried to assure sanders supporters that biden is liberal enough, particularly on health care.\n\nthe former president said it's time to go further than obamacare.\n\nwe should make plans affordable for everyone, provide everyone with a public option, expand medicare and finish the job so that health care isn't just a right, but a reality for everybody, he said.\n\nbiden has been critical of sanders' proposed medicare for all, which calls for a single-payer system.\n\nthere's too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards, we have to look to the future, obama said. bernie understands that. and joe understands that.\n\nobama noted that a biden administration would go much further on climate change.\n\nwe have to return the u.s. to the paris agreement and lead the world in reducing the pollution that causes climate change, obama said. but science tells us we have to go much further – that it's time for us to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator, save us money and secure our children's future.\n\nof course, democrats may not always agree on every detail of the best way to bring about each and every one of these changes, obama continued. but we do agree that they're needed. and that only happens if we win this election.\n\non the campaign trail, biden has noted how he was still in contact with the former president. biden said during a virtual fundraiser that he turned to obama for advice on choosing a vice presidential candidate, according to a pool report of the event. biden said obama told him to find someone who has experience where the former vice president is lacking, a dynamic that worked well between the two.\n\nand so i'm going to need a woman vice president who has the capacity, has strengths where i have weaknesses, biden said during remarks at the virtual fundraiser, according to the pool report.\n\nobama's endorsement is not the first time he has spoken out during the 2020 primary election. in march, obama demanded south carolina television stations and a pro-trump group stop airing an advertisement that used his voice to attack biden.\n\nthe ad, aired by the committee to defend the president super pac, includes audio of obama reading from his memoir, dreams from my father, about democrats who court black voters only at election time. in the book, obama paraphrased the words of someone else.\n\nstep one: done:now that bernie sanders out, joe biden gets an earlier-than-expected start\n\nobama spokeswoman katie hill, in a statement, called the ad despicable.\n\npresident obama has several friends in this race, including, of course, his own esteemed vice president, she said in the statement.\n\ntrump questioned why obama didn't endorse biden early on in the campaign.\n\ni don't know why president obama hasn't supported joe biden a long time ago, trump said at a coronavirus briefing, claiming that obama feels something is wrong.\n\nit does amaze me that president obama hasn't supported sleepy joe. it just hasn't happened. when's it gonna happen? why isn't he? he knows something that you don't know, that i think i know, that you don't know, the president speculated. he did not elaborate.\n\ncontributing: john fritze
palm beach, florida - u.s. sen. rick scott has a message for states and cities poised to receive a collective $360 billion from the american rescue act stimulus package: send it back.\n\nscott's call to reject money that polls show is popular nationally, even among republicans, has flared tension between scott and another florida gop leader, gov. ron desantis.\n\nin an open letter to governors and mayors, sent moments after the u.s. house on wednesday approved the $1.9 trillion bill, scott called it massive, wasteful and non-targeted, urging states to follow his lead and send a message to congress to quit recklessly spending other people's money.\n\nby rejecting and returning any unneeded funds, as well as funds unrelated to covid-19, you would be taking responsible action to avoid wasting scarce tax dollars, he wrote. after all, every dollar in this package is borrowed.\n\nmore:democrats blast state gop plans to use stimulus for corporate tax breaks\n\nscott, a former governor of florida, called his request simple and common sense, adding that money slated for state and local governments is wholly unrelated to responding to the pandemic.\n\nscott has a history of bucking federal funds. as governor, he refused to allow florida to accept obamacare-related money to expand medicaid health care coverage.\n\nhis letter comes as polls show the legislation is extremely popular. a morning consult/politico poll found 69% of u.s. voters said the package is the right amount or doesn't go far enough, including 54% of republicans.\n\nthe latter includes, apparently, scott's successor, desantis, who complained florida should be getting a bigger piece of the pie.\n\nwhile scott was calling for rejection of the assistance, desantis announced he has big plans for the stimulus money. and he may well be blaming scott, at least partly, for not getting florida more of it.\n\nthe senate didn't correct the fact that florida is getting a lot less than what we would be entitled to on a per capita basis, desantis, in an apparent jab at scott and sen. marco rubio, said monday at a press conference.\n\nthe polarization on spending comes amid rumors that both desantis and scott have eyes on the white house in 2024. at odds on numerous issues, desantis has for almost a year blamed scott for the massive failures of the state's unemployment system, which was developed and implemented when scott served as governor.\n\nmore:scrap or salvage? state lawmakers weigh future of florida's unemployment system\n\nstill, at monday's press conference, desantis did not mention a word about using the stimulus money to help jobless individuals or small businesses devastated by the pandemic.\n\ninstead, desantis said he would like to see some of the money go toward his resilient florida plan to fight flooding and sea level rise.\n\ni think that will be a game changer, he said. it's infrastructure we would have needed to have done anyways.\n\ndesantis also lamented the fact that stimulus money will be disseminated to states based on things like unemployment rates instead of population, meaning florida will be penalized for having a stronger economy than some other states, he said.\n\nthe reason is that we have better indicators in florida than these other states, he said. so, that's not fair.\n\nscott, along with every congressional republican, voted against the covid-19 relief package, which democrats say was designed to combat the virus from public health and economic standpoints.\n\nhouse democrats hailed final passage of the bill on wednesday afternoon.\n\nu.s. rep. ted deutch, d-boca raton, said in a statement moments after the bill was passed that congress followed through on our promise to the american people to crush this virus and get americans back on their feet.\n\ndeutch said the legislation is a transformative plan to boost vaccinations, offer financial relief and send children back to school and workers back to their job.\n\nthe american rescue plan is our commitment to the health and financial success of america's working families, deutch wrote.\n\nfellow palm beach county democrat u.s. rep. lois frankel said the measure, after a year of stress and hardship on millions of people, ranked as the most important, impactful piece of legislation she has ever voted on.\n\nit will get vaccines into the arms of americans, return children safely to the classroom, put money into the pockets of families, and get people back to work, said frankel.\n\nthe landmark legislation, which is an early, major achievement for president joe biden, is intended to stimulate the economy and alleviate enormous and widespread suffering in the wake of the pandemic.\n\neven so, desantis and florida senate president wilton simpson, r-trilby, last week said they would consider using a portion of the money to replenish the state's unemployment fund in lieu of raising taxes on businesses.\n\nmore:democrats blast state gop plans to use stimulus for corporate tax breaks\n\nand florida is not the only state that has floated the idea of using stimulus money to offset tax hikes.\n\nin new york, democratic sen. chuck schumer said he would like to see stimulus money used to wipe out the state's budget deficit and avoid raising taxes on the wealthy, who already pay the highest tax rate in the country, the new york post reported.\n\nthe examples underscore the reasons scott did not vote to pass the american rescue plan in the first place.\n\njust as it does for other major disasters, the federal government has an important role to play in helping state and municipal governments offset the costs of covid-19 response, scott wrote in his letter. however, american taxpayer dollars should not be used as bonus cash to plug budget holes caused by decades of poor fiscal management.\n\nstates could use a portion of the money to reimburse specific, covid-related expenses, but should return, or not accept, anything further, scott wrote, reiterating his commitment to support federal efforts to defeat the virus, protect families and small businesses, help the unemployed and develop life-saving vaccines.\n\n@wendyrhodesfl
craig gilbert\n\nusa today\n\nwashington – along with the vast political stakes for his party and president, the dramatic house showdown over health care is a test of speaker paul ryan's ability to deliver on the promise of unified republican rule.\n\nwe as a party have been an opposition party for 10 years … now, in three months time, we have to go from being an opposition party to being a governing party, ryan told wisconsin talk-radio host jay weber on wednesday.\n\npaul ryan is all in on getting this passed. his prestige is on the line, said his gop colleague from wisconsin, jim sensenbrenner. if this one fails, the ability to deliver on the next big (issue) is going to be significantly impaired.\n\nryan is calling thursday's scheduled vote repealing and replacing the affordable care act his party's rendezvous with destiny.\n\nbut it is also the sternest measure by far of his 16-month-old tenure as speaker, and of his leadership style, salesmanship, deal-making skills and capacity to corral a gop caucus united against obamacare but divided over what should take its place.\n\nwinning house passage thursday would be a huge but provisional victory. the bill would still face daunting odds in the senate.\n\na defeat in the house, however, would damage ryan's speakership and undermine his far-reaching conservative agenda, which for political, parliamentary and budget reasons hinges on early repeal of obamacare.\n\nread more:\n\nfreedom caucus claims enough votes to kill obamacare repeal\n\nthe house health care battle: what's at stake?\n\ntwo marks, meadows and walker, leave mark on obamacare repeal bill\n\nlosing this vote makes the speaker look weak, says matt green, a catholic university political scientist and expert on the office of house speaker. it empowers skeptical groups in his party, particularly the (hard line conservative) freedom caucus, and emboldens them to challenge ryan on future bills. it could arguably worsen the relationship between president and the speaker.\n\ngreen added, i am sure that ryan — and other speakers have done this — is talking to some members and saying, 'if this goes down, i lose and we all lose. so help a guy out here.' \n\nryan's challenges have included a politically explosive issue (health care), a tortuous multi-pronged legislative path (complicated by the senate's filibuster and budget rules), and the much heavier lift of forging a real-life replacement law rather than what ryan calls the fake opportunities to kill this law the party attempted when president obama was still in the white house.\n\nthe gop plan is not polling well, and independent studies have suggested it could cost many older enrollees in rural gop districts thousands in insurance subsidies.\n\nhouse republicans should wake up. they should not walk the plank! senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., declared wednesday.\n\nin ryan's home state of wisconsin, a poll by the marquette law school released wednesday showed only 28% of registered voters supported a republican replacement of obamacare, and 60% supported either keeping obamacare or keeping and improving it.\n\na small faction of gop conservatives remains ideologically opposed to the bill, saying it doesn't go far enough in undoing the current law.\n\nthis is really a defeat of paul ryan, sen. rand paul, r-ky., said, predicting the bill would go down. he's going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.\n\nbut ryan, who has a history of winning legislative debates within his own party, continued to talk up his prospects, and the vital backing of president trump.\n\nhis hope — and possibly most powerful political argument — is that republicans simply can't afford this kind of defeat in the early stages of their monopoly on power in washington.\n\nit will be a fundamental broken promise if the bill fails, ryan said wednesday on hugh hewitt's radio how. there is no more prominent promise any republican has made over the last seven years than this one.\n\nrepublican tom cole, an ally of ryan's, said i think you have to go back to square one and rethink your entire legislative schedule if the bill fails.\n\ngreen, the political scientist, said he thought ryan had shown political savvy in how he had pushed for an early vote, tried to thread the needle in his party, and worked to piece together a majority.\n\nbut repealing obamacare may prove to be a hard promise to keep.\n\nthe speaker knows that what's on the line is the republican majority's ability to deliver on its campaign promises, said sensenbrenner, who noted that ryan has taken complete ownership of the bill.\n\nhe put his name on it. he knew that he would get a bump if it passed, particularly in terms of the issues to come, sensenbrenner said. but he also was taking the risk.
eugene kiely, brooks jackson, lori robertson, robert farley, jessica mcdonald, saranac hale spencer and angelo fichera\n\nfactcheck.org\n\nthe second group of 10 democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation and the environment, and repeated familiar talking points on taxes, health care and poverty.\n\nformer vice president joe biden falsely claimed president trump immediately discontinued an aid program to central america, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the u.s.-mexico border. the aid was reduced about 23 percent during trump's first two years.\n\nformer colorado gov. john hickenlooper and sen. bernie sanders both alluded to a deadline for climate change, but scientists say it's the wrong way of thinking about it.\n\nsanders repeated an old, misleading claim that 83% of the benefits from the republican tax law go to the top 1% of income earners. that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes expire unless congress extends them.\n\npushing back against trump's claims that the economy is doing great, sen. kamala harris said, well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs. the percentage of american workers holding multiple jobs is 5 percent and is virtually unchanged from when trump took office.\n\nbiden accused harris of a mischaracterization of my position across the board after she confronted him on his past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern democrats. both candidates have a point.\n\ncalifornia rep. eric swalwell said he was the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks. that's false. a campaign spokesperson said he was referring to universal background checks, but even that claim is misleading.\n\nhickenlooper said, inaccurately, that the green new deal promises every american a government job. the nonbinding resolution guarantees a job, but not necessarily one in government.\n\nsanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it.\n\nsanders repeated an erroneous claim from his 2016 presidential campaign that the u.s. has the highest rate of childhood poverty. while the country does have a high relative child poverty rate, several other countries have worse rates.\n\n'that little girl is me':harris challenges biden in key debate moment. here are 4 other takeaways\n\nbiden on central american aid\n\nformer vice president joe biden falsely claimed president trump immediately discontinued an aid program to central america, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the u.s.-mexico border.\n\nin fact, the obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during trump's first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the obama aid program commenced. trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.\n\nbiden: i'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement … to spend $740 million to deal with the [border] problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. it was working. we saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. the crisis was abated. and along came this president, and he said — he immediately discontinued that.\n\nbiden was referring to the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america, which began under obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a june 12 report by the congressional research service, an arm of the library of congress. (see table 5, page 13.)\n\nappropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began oct. 1, 2016, before trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.\n\nfrom there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the crs report. that's a reduction of just under 23 percent.\n\nsusan page:biden's image as the inevitable nominee, the one to beat trump, was dinged thursday\n\ntrump's budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under obama.\n\nin march, however, trump told reporters, i've ended payments to guatemala, to honduras, and to el salvador. no money goes there anymore. he directed the state department to withhold appropriated aid funds. but that was a response to — not a cause of — the renewed surge in immigration.\n\nat the time trump spoke, march apprehensions of immigrants illegally attempting to cross the u.s.-mexico border were surging to 92,840, more than triple the level of march 2015, prior to the aid program to which biden referred. far from being abated, the crisis of which biden spoke had come back with a vengeance.\n\ntrump has since relented on his threat. on june 18 — after widespread criticism — his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved — out of the $615 million in aid that trump had ordered to be frozen.\n\nclimate change confusion\n\ntwo candidates, former colorado gov. john hickenlooper and sen. bernie sanders, mentioned time frames in their discussions of climate change that could use some additional context.\n\nhickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, i share the sense of urgency. i'm a scientist, so i recognize that we're within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.\n\nsanders later said, the scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.\n\nthe 12-year figure is frequently mentioned by the press and politicians, and is extrapolated from a 2018 special report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which found that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°c between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. the world has already warmed about 1 degree celsius.\n\nthe report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels — and avoid the many climate change effects — the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.\n\nbiden and bernie:wide-eyed joe biden dodges bernie sanders' hand in viral debate moment\n\nin 2018, that statement was taken by many to mean there were only 12 years left to do something about climate change. but many scientists have since come forward to say that's the wrong way of thinking about it.\n\nmyles allen, an author of the ipcc report and the leader of the eci climate research programme at the university of oxford, explained in a conversation story he wrote in april that the ipcc's timing is only a best estimate.\n\nplease stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030, he wrote. bad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters, but the ipcc does not draw a 'planetary boundary' at 1.5°c beyond which lie climate dragons.\n\nkristie l. ebi, director of the center for health and the global environment at the university of washington in seattle, told the ap, this has been a persistent source of confusion, adding, the report never said we only have 12 years left.\n\nand kate marvel, a nasa climate scientist, told axios in january, 12 years isn't a deadline, and climate change isn't a cliff we fall off — it's a slope we slide down. she added, we don't have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time. it's already here. and even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn't going to end in exactly twelve years.\n\nsanders' tax law talking point\n\nsanders repeated the same misleading claim about the republican tax law that he and other democrats have recited since the law passed at the end of 2017.\n\nsanders said during the debate, 83% of your tax benefits go to the 1%.\n\nbut that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.\n\nwe've written about this claim before — when sanders said it during a cnn town hall and when democratic sen. sherrod brown of ohio and house minority leader nancy pelosi said it shortly after the law passed.\n\nsen. kamala harris also partly echoed the claim during the debate, saying that she would repeal the tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country.\n\nthursday democratic debate:who were the winners and losers\n\nmost of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. an analysis by the tax policy center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. that percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.\n\nbefore the law was passed, republicans said that they expected a future congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. they structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the senate, which meant that republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. also, they couldn't have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.\n\nso, while it will be true that 83% of the tax cut benefits will go to the top 1% of income earners in 2027 if congress doesn't act before then, it is misleading to give that statistic without context.\n\nharris on people working multiple jobs\n\npushing back against president trump's claims that the economy is doing great, sen. kamala harris said, well yeah, people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs. the percentage of american workers who hold multiple jobs is virtually unchanged from when trump took office, according to the bureau of labor statistics.\n\nharris: i'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs — you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right — my great economy, my great economy … you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs.\n\naccording to the bureau of labor statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in may, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. that percentage has remained virtually unchanged during trump's presidency — it was 4.9 percent in january 2017 when he took office. in fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it's lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.\n\neric swalwell:swalwell calls on joe biden to 'pass the torch' during democratic debates\n\nlooking deeper into the 7,855,000 who held multiple jobs in may, the majority — 4.4 million — were people with full-time jobs who had a secondary part-time job, according to a bls news release (see table a-18). another nearly 2 million had two part-time jobs, and about 325,000 held two full-time jobs.\n\nwe looked into a similar claim last july when then-congressional candidate alexandria ocasio-cortez wrongly claimed that the low u.s. unemployment rate was because everyone has two jobs. the number of people holding more than one job has no bearing on the unemployment rate.\n\nbiden, harris on race\n\nin one of the most contentious moments of the debate, harris confronted biden on two race-related issues: biden's past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern democrats, sens. james eastland of mississippi and herman talmadge of georgia.\n\nharris, who is black, accurately noted that biden worked with them to oppose busing, and told the story of her own school integration experience as an elementary student. as we have written, berkeley public schools in california began busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and harris began attending school in 1969.\n\nspanish during the debate:beto o'rourke, cory booker weren't the first to drop spanish in a debate. and they likely won't be the last\n\nbiden, who was first elected to the senate in 1972, accused harris of a mischaracterization of my position across the board. in telling her personal story, harris left out a key detail: it was the local school district's decision to integrate its schools.\n\nthe former vice president said he opposed busing ordered by the department of education, or what critics called forced busing, in the 1970s. you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council, biden said. in fact, harris was attending an integrated school before biden even joined the senate.\n\nbut harris did not mischaracterize biden's comments about eastland and talmadge, so she did not mischaracterize his position across the board.\n\nharris said it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. biden responded by saying, i did not praise racists. harris didn't say he did. she said he talked about their reputations, and biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the senate, despite their political and personal differences.\n\nat a june 18 fundraiser in new york, biden described talmadge as one of the meanest guys i ever knew, and said eastland referred to him as son instead of senator, which he took as a sign of disrespect.\n\nbut, in comparison to the current political climate in washington, biden went on to say: at least there was some civility. we got things done. we didn't agree on much of anything. we got things done. we got it finished. but today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. not the opposition, the enemy. we don't talk to each other anymore.\n\nswalwell on background checks\n\nrep. eric swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.\n\nthat's clearly false. biden, for example, was in the senate in 1993 and voted for the brady handgun violence prevention act, which became law. it requires federally licensed firearms dealers to conduct background checks on most gun transfers to prospective buyers.\n\nclosing lines:`we can't return to the same old approach,' and other closing lines from the democratic debate\n\nswalwell's campaign explained that the california congressman meant he was the only person on stage who has voted for and passed universal background checks.\n\nthat's true, but still misleading.\n\nswalwell did vote for the bipartisan background checks act that passed the democratic-controlled house by a vote of 240-190 in february. the legislation, according to the congressional research service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.\n\nhowever, four other people on the debate stage — sanders, harris, sen. michael bennet and sen. kirsten gillibrand — are all co-sponsors of the background check expansion act, which would expand federal background checks to all gun sales, according to lawmakers who reintroduced the bill in january. (sens. elizabeth warren and cory booker, who were in the previous night's debate, are also co-sponsors.)\n\nbut because the senate is currently controlled by republicans, that bill has virtually no chance at passing in the chamber.\n\nspinning the green new deal\n\nafter being asked about his concerns about embracing socialism, hickenlooper misrepresented the green new deal, objecting to a provision in the legislation that doesn't exist.\n\ni admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change — i'm a scientist, he said, but we can't promise every american a government job.\n\nthe green new deal, which we've written about before, is a nonbinding resolution that aims to tackle climate change while ensuring job security, health care and protecting vulnerable communities.\n\nthe green new deal doesn't promise every american a position in the government. instead, it guarantees a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the united states.\n\nthe resolution was introduced into both chambers of congress in february, and is most closely associated with new york freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez. in march, the resolution did not advance in the senate, after nearly all democrats voted present.\n\nhealth care repeat\n\nsanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it. as we've written before, it's misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.\n\ntrump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the republican-backed american health care act, which wasn't expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. but he also backed an immediate repeal of the aca, with a replacement at a later date.\n\nin 2017 the congressional budget office estimated the obamacare repeal reconciliation act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. but not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. cbo said: in the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.\n\nthe aca imposed a tax penalty, known as the mandate, on those without health insurance, but the republican tax law repealed that penalty as of jan. 1 of this year. it's worth noting that in may 2018, the cbo revised downward its estimate of the impact of repealing the mandate.\n\n2016 flashback on poverty claim\n\nin his closing statement, sanders said he suspects people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas, but how come nothing really changes?\n\nhe then posed several questions, including, how come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?\n\nthat's an unchanging — and false — sanders claim. we debunked it twice during his 2016 presidential run.\n\na 2017 report by the united nations children's fund, or unicef, did note that the united states is above average when it comes to the relative child poverty rate — which shows the proportion of each nation's children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.\n\nbut the report did not indicate the u.s. had the highest rate. the country ranked no. 7 out of 41 rich countries, behind romania, israel, turkey and others.\n\nthe u.s. census bureau pegged the 2017 poverty rate for those under age 18 at 17.5 percent (see table 3), which is the lowest it's been since 2006.\n\nthe bureau also calculates the supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for government programs that assist low-income families and are not considered in the official poverty measure. the spm rate for children in 2017 was 15.6 percent.
josh hafner\n\nusa today\n\nit's one day until the iowa caucuses. and as a storm of candidates makes its final sweep across iowa, a literal storm holds potential to hamper the caucuses' turnout.\n\nwintry weather may hit iowa by monday evening just as iowans head out to caucus. that could be a problem for donald trump and bernie sanders — outsider candidates who need high voter turnout.\n\nhere's what's happening as the candidates spend their final hours in iowa:\n\ntrump feeling pretty confident: we're going to win\n\nwe're going to win, we're going to win, trump told a crowd in a middle school gym in council bluffs sunday. we're leading everywhere.\n\nasked what he might be looking for in a running mate, trump said it was too early to be making those decisions. but he added, there are some great people out there.\n\nclinton keeps it practical in final plea\n\nstill in a tight race with sanders, hillary clinton has sought to portray him as an unrealistic idealist and herself as more grounded.\n\ni don't want to over promise and under deliver, clinton said in council bluffs. i'd rather under promise and over deliver.\n\ntrump and cruz trade blows on sunday shows\n\noh, it got real:\n\nhere's a guy with all of these senators. not one endorsement of cruz, because he's a nasty guy. nobody likes him, trump told abc's this week.\n\nand cruz, on cnn's state of the union: (trump's) position on health care is the same as bernie sanders'. they both support socialized medicine, expanding obamacare to put the government in charge of our health care.\n\nread all the spats here.\n\nsanders is a hit with young people, but will they show up?\n\nhere's a nice summary of sanders' concern: i'd love to be supportive of him, said brandon holdgrafer, a student in the college town of ames. i can't, i have class.\n\neven if sanders can get young voters to show up, their support might be too concentrated in counties like story. democratic candidates win in iowa by collecting delegates in every county instead of by running up the popular vote, our own heidi przybyla reports.\n\nclinton and trump take slim leads in the only poll that matters\n\nthe iowa poll, from the des moines register, is a near sacred institution in politics. it's conducted by ann selzer, the best pollster in politics, and has regularly predicted contests in the state with uncanny accuracy.\n\nhere's what the poll found, as published in sunday's register:\n\nclinton is the top pick for 45% of likely democratic caucusgoers, with sanders at 42%, the des moines register/bloomberg politics poll shows. clinton's support is up 3 percentage points from earlier this month, and sanders' is 2 percentage points higher.\n\nand for the republicans:\n\ndonald trump has muscled ahead in iowa, regaining his lead on the brink of the first votes being cast in the 2016 presidential race. trump stands at 28%, while rival ted cruz has slid to 23%. but there's still a strong case for cruz in this race — he's more popular and respected than trump …\n\ncruz, now behind, 'thrilled' with the poll's results\n\nif you had told me a year ago that two days out from the iowa caucuses we would be neck and neck, effectively tied for first place in the state of iowa, i would have been thrilled, cruz told the register in sioux city on saturday.\n\nstay positive, ted.\n\nour iowa preview: is donald trump for real?\n\nthat's what usa today's susan page asks, along with three more key questions as we look ahead to monday.\n\nif trump draws enough first-time caucusgoers to outweigh cruz's superior ground organization, he could win, page says. and trump has a bigger lead in new hampshire than he does in iowa.\n\nwill democrats turn left?\n\nclinton leads among democrats who have attended the caucuses before; sanders leads among those who haven't but say they will this time. like trump on the republican side, sanders is depending on turning out new voters.\n\nare dynasties like the bushes and clintons dead?\n\nvoters seem to be in a mood for outsiders, and it's hard for dynasty candidates to claim that mantle. some iowans express weariness with candidates whose family foibles have become all too familiar.\n\nwill iowa pick the eventual president?\n\n 'you haven't had a winner in 16 years,' trump told a crowd in dubuque on saturday. 'what are you doing?' that is a string they could break, he tells them: by voting for him.\n\nwho's still in iowa monday?\n\nmost, but not all, of the candidates will make their last pleas to iowans. (we miss you, jeb.) and many, including clinton, sanders, marco rubio and santorum, will host caucus results watch parties across des moines.\n\nsee all the details at the register's candidate tracker.\n\nfollow josh hafner on twitter: @joshhafner
early voting in arizona's primary started aug. 1 and the az fact check team is looking back at five times politicians have stretched the truth in an attempt to take down their primary opponent or to set themselves up for the upcoming general election.\n\nfor more details on the fact checks below and all of the coverage by the az fact check team, go to az fact check.\n\nhere are the five fact checks to read before you vote in the primary.\n\n1. kyrsten sinema claims she stopped a pay raise for congress — is she right?\n\nin one of her early campaign videos posted on twitter, u.s. rep. kyrsten sinema, who is competing for the democratic nomination for u.s. senate against deedra abboud, claimed that she stopped congress from giving themselves a pay raise this year.\n\nsinema is positioning herself as a moderate politician who is capable of getting things done in congress. this includes a claim from april that she stepped in and prevented congress from getting its automatic pay raise this year.\n\nmore fact check: did sinema stop raises for congress?\n\nsinema did write a letter to the appropriations committee and even introduced an act that would have blocked the pay increase. but sinema was not the only member of congress to take steps to block pay raises.\n\nin fact, blocking its own pay increases seems to be one of the few things congress has been able to consistently do. congress has not seen a raise since 2009, and not all of that is thanks to sinema. her claim was rated one out of four stars, mostly false.\n\n2. is arizona the most politically corrupt state in the nation?\n\narizona state university professor and education expert david garcia is running in the democratic primary for governor against kelly fryer, the executive director of tucson's ywca for the past five years, and state sen. steve farley, veteran of arizona's legislature.\n\ngarcia has focused his campaign on criticisms of gov. doug ducey, including a claim in garcia's first campaign ad that under ducey's leadership arizona has been the most corrupt state in the country.\n\nmore fact check: is az the most corrupt state in nation?\n\ngarcia's source for the claim was a harvard study from the year before ducey took office.\n\nmore recent studies from the same researchers, studies from other groups and the number of corruption convictions in the state under ducey's administration have shown that arizona is middle of the road in terms of government corruption.\n\nwhile arizona does have its fair share of corruption, az fact check gave garcia's claim zero stars and a false rating. since the fact check published, garcia rarely, if ever, makes the claim.\n\n3. is ducey responsible for mccain's 'no' vote on 'obamacare' repeal?\n\ndemocrats aren't the only people attacking ducey this campaign season.\n\nthe first-term arizona governor is facing a primary challenge from ken bennett, the former arizona secretary of state and senate president who lost to ducey in the republican primary four years ago.\n\nducey is the heavy favorite and has generally overlooked bennett. but bennett has launched numerous attacks on ducey's conservative credentials and what he sees as a lack of support for president donald trump's agenda.\n\nmore fact check: did ducey prompt mccain's aca vote?\n\none of these attacks is his claim that ducey is responsible for u.s. sen. john mccain's no vote on an attempt to repeal the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.\n\nducey did tweet out his dissatisfaction with the repeal attempt as it stood the day mccain gave his thumbs-down. but both the governor and mccain say that ducey told the arizona senator to vote for the repeal, a suggestion mccain simply did not follow.\n\naz fact check rated that claim zero stars out of four stars, false.\n\n4. mailer attacking state sen. kate brophy mcgee's record on tax bill misses the mark.\n\nthe next fact check was not a claim made by a candidate but instead comes from sunlight arizona, a program of the progressive non-profit one arizona attacking state sen. kate brophy mcgee, r-phoenix, for what it claims is a failure to close arizona's corporate tax loopholes.\n\nthe group specifically cited her failure to take action on senate bill 1415, a bill that would have raised the minimum corporate tax from $50 to $500.\n\nmore fact check: did sen. mcgee do enough on taxes?\n\nthe only problem is that bill is currently sitting in a committee that mcgee is not a part of, meaning she has not had an opportunity to take any action on it. the fact check team gave the claim zero out of four stars, false.\n\n5. kelli ward claims martha mcsally has supported amnesty 11 times.\n\nkelli ward is facing former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio and u.s. rep. martha mcsally in the republican primary for a u.s. senate seat.\n\nward has consistently attacked mcsally for being a liberal republican who is weak on border security. as part of those claims, ward said that mcsally voted for amnesty 11 times.\n\nmost of the bills are related to the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, also known as daca, which provides a temporary protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children.\n\nmore fact check: does martha mcsally support amnesty?\n\nmcsally does have a history of supporting protections for daca recipients, something that she has tried to hide this election, but the mainstream definition of amnesty requires a pathway to permanent legal residence, something that the daca program does not do.\n\nof the 11 bills cited by the ward campaign, only three provide a pathway to permanent legal residence. two of the bills have yet to receive a vote, leading az fact check to rate the claim zero out of four stars, false.
richard wolf\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — the power struggle that has played out over the past five years between the obama administration and the supreme court is about to lose its central player.\n\neven as the high court prepares to issue major rulings on abortion, immigration and affirmative action, u.s. solicitor general donald verrilli — the president's supreme court advocate — is relinquishing the lectern to his deputy, ian gershengorn. by monday, when the justices may deliver the term's final verdicts, he will be jetting to italy for a three-week vacation.\n\nsolicitor general donald verrilli departing after historic run at supreme court\n\nverrilli's tenure has been remarkable for its rapid-fire succession of historic cases, from obamacare and immigration to voting rights and same-sex marriage, that pitted a progressive democratic administration against a court dominated by the nominees of republican presidents. through it all, the 58-year-old appellate lawyer had to represent his client without repelling the court.\n\nthis is a progressive administration that wanted to use the power that we believe ... the constitution gives the federal government to address the great problems confronting the nation, verrilli said during an exit interview in his justice department office. those actions were being evaluated by a court whose majority probably started out with a degree of skepticism.\n\nnot since president franklin delano roosevelt tangled with the high court over the new deal in the 1930s has the docket been so power-packed or oral arguments so intense. verrilli, who has served in the job longer than any predecessor in 43 years, has won slightly more than half of the most significant cases.\n\nat supreme court, solicitor general donald verrilli won big and lost big\n\nit's been a remarkable stretch, he said. i can't think of a time since the 1930s when the role of the court in the life of the nation and in the unfolding of the political process has been as central as it's been in the last five years.\n\nand while fdr's battles with the justices were more intense, verrilli said, we haven't exactly seen eye to eye now on everything.\n\nthat would include four cases involving obama's signature health care law — two in which the court upheld the statute against potentially fatal challenges, and two in which it overturned or questioned regulations requiring that religious objectors offer insurance coverage for contraceptives.\n\nother battles over federal power, or the president's authority over congress, dealt with immigration policy, environmental regulation and executive branch appointments.\n\nas a result of ... what everybody would agree is a fair level of dysfunction in the legislative process, the executive branch has had to decide how it's going to use executive power in order to try to protect and advance the country's interests, verrilli said. that's created conflict.\n\ndespite their differences, verrilli gives high marks to chief justice john roberts, who he called a fair-minded jurist. roberts has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives for his rulings, which range from weakening the voting rights act to upholding the affordable care act.\n\nhe cares about the place of the institution in our constitutional structure, verrilli said. he cares deeply about maintaining the integrity of the court and the integrity of the judiciary as a vital part of our democratic system.\n\nthat hasn't always been easy with a court now evenly divided between conservative and liberal justices in the wake of justice antonin scalia's death in february. it was scalia who in 1986 helped create what is known as a hot bench — one that questions lawyers unsparingly, often within seconds of their opening remarks.\n\nwithout scalia, certainly oral argument has been a little different, verrilli said. but the lawyers representing the government continue to prepare for an eight-member bench the same way — for instance, by assuming their initial statements should last no longer than 45 seconds.\n\nthat, verrilli said, tends to be the most time you get before somebody jumps into a question.
washington – the ongoing thrust and parry between democrats and the trump administration over obamacare may leave the average person wondering what health care coverage created by the 2010 landmark law is still available and what's changed.\n\nhouse democrats will continue their vigorous defense of the affordable care act thursday when they bring to the floor measures to roll back some of president donald trump's alterations to the law. democrats' package includes provisions that would block trump's expansion of short-term plans that don't meet all the aca's requirements and would restore outreach funding that helps people enroll in obamacare plans.\n\nsome of trump's changes are also being challenged in court.\n\nand that's where republicans are still trying to overturn the entire law, which they weren't able to undo when they controlled both the house and senate.\n\nfor now, people who aren't covered through a government or workplace plan can still get insurance through healthcare.gov. however, there's less support from the government to help them enroll. and there are options for other kinds of plans that are cheaper but less comprehensive.\n\nhere's what consumers need to know about where the law stands.\n\nwhat's changed?\n\nrepublicans got rid of one of the most unpopular parts of the law – the individual mandate – by using their 2017 package of tax cuts to eliminate the aca's tax penalty for people who don't have insurance.\n\non its own, the administration stopped reimbursing insurers for the discounts they're required to give lower-income customers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. (insurers, however, are still required to give customers the discounts.)\n\nthe administration cut in half the amount of time people have to enroll in plans. and the department of health and human services dramatically reduced funding used to make people aware of the enrollment period and to offer in-person assistance to enrollees.\n\nthe department has also told states that they can create new types of insurance plans that don't comply with all the aca's rules – such as what benefits must be covered and the law's ban on tying premiums to health status. but no state has asked to do that.\n\nthe administration has expanded the availability of short-term plans, which cost less because they limit – or exclude – some types of coverage. (for example, short-term policies typically don't cover maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health care, and preventive care.)\n\nrepublicans argue consumers need more options because the obamacare plans are too expensive. democrats say the alternative plans mislead people into thinking they will get the care they need if they get sick – while also driving up the premiums of more comprehensive obamacare plans by siphoning away healthier customers.\n\nthe house voted primarily along party lines this month to block the administration from letting states offer looser plans. and the package of bills being considered thursday would roll back the expansion of short-term plans, as well as provide new funding to help people enroll in obamacare plans.\n\nthose bills are expected to die in the gop-controlled senate. but the expansion of short-term plans is also being challenged in court.\n\nwhat's in limbo?\n\nsome of trump's changes have already been blocked – at least temporarily – by legal challenges.\n\na federal judge in january imposed an injunction on a dramatic expansion of employers' ability to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons.\n\nand in march, a federal judge said trump's plan making it easier for small employers to band together to buy insurance was clearly an end-run around the aca. but some states that supported the change may not enforce the judge's ruling on plans sold in their jurisdictions, kaiser health news has reported.\n\nin july, the fifth circuit court of appeals will hear oral arguments in the attempt by gop attorneys general to have the entire law struck down. the justice department has told the court it agrees with the challengers that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nif the law is overturned, nearly all americans would be affected in some way, according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.\n\nwhat hasn't changed?\n\nfor now, the basic structure of obamacare remains. people who aren't offered insurance through an employer or a government program can buy healthcare.gov plans, with subsidized premiums for those earning up to 400% of poverty. people with incomes up to 250% of poverty are also eligible for reductions in deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. (on average, a 40-year-old making $45,000 pays $227 a month for a subsidized low-cost plan, according to the kaiser family foundation. if the same person earned $50,000, the plan would cost $340 a month without the subsidy.)\n\nenrollment, however, is down about 10% from its peak of 12.7 million in 2016.\n\npopular parts of the aca are intact. young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' insurance plans. preventive services, such as flu shots and mammograms, must be covered without co-pays or other cost sharing. insurers can't exclude sick customers or charge them more. insurers also can't put annual or lifetime dollar limits on most benefits. and they have to issue refunds if they end up needing less than a specified share of premiums collected to cover health care expenses.\n\nthe law's expansion of medicaid eligibility remains, although more than a dozen states have chosen not to go along.\n\nwhat would democrats do if they were in charge?\n\nbesides trying to undo trump's changes – and prevent more – democrats have introduced legislation to expand the aca. that would include making premium subsidies for obamacare plans more generous as well as available to higher-income families.\n\nthat proposal is separate from the democrats' intraparty debate on whether to expand coverage through government plans instead of using subsidized private insurance. while the strongest advocates for medicare for all envision eliminating all or most private insurance, others want to give people the option of remaining in a private plan or buying into a government-run plan like medicare or medicaid.\n\nhow many people still lack insurance?\n\nthe number of americans without health insurance increased again in 2018, the second consecutive year that figure has risen after several years of declines under obamacare, a centers for disease control and prevention survey shows.\n\nabout 30.4 million americans did not have health insurance in 2018, up from 29.3 million in 2017, according to the cdc's national health interview survey. that means about 1.1 million more americans lost insurance coverage last year.\n\nthe cdc survey followed a congressional budget office report last month that found a similar decline in health coverage after years of gains under the affordable care act.\n\ncontributing: ken alltucker\n\nlike what you're reading?:download the usa today app for more
president donald trump spent more than 80 minutes making a case for his reelection at a packed phoenix rally on wednesday evening.\n\nemploying many of the same themes and talking points he had used in his state of the union speech and to rile up crowds in new hampshire and iowa, he touted low unemployment and new jobs, boasted about improved life expectancy and mocked his democratic opponents.\n\nand, though it took him more than 45 minutes to get there, he condemned illegal immigration at the u.s.-mexico border and gloated about deportation numbers, drug seizures and border wall progress.\n\nhis claims, some of them specifically geared toward an arizona crowd, generated plenty of enthusiasm — although the build the wall! chant heard at past campaign events was absent.\n\nhere's a closer look at what trump said wednesday, with analysis from arizona republic reporters.\n\nimmigration\n\non the cost of illegal immigration\n\nwhat trump said: trump said illegal immigration costs arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year.\n\nthe facts: trump appeared to be referring to an outdated report by the federation for american immigration reform, a group that advocates against illegal immigration. the 2012 report estimated that unauthorized immigrants cost arizona $2.4 billion, estimating arizona's 2010 undocumented population at 390,000.\n\nthat population estimate appears to be inflated, however: it's higher than the 350,000 unauthorized immigrants the department of homeland security estimated resided in arizona in 2010 and the pew research center's estimate of 325,000.\n\nfair also included in its $2.4 billion estimate costs such as k-12 education, which amounted to $1.3 billion, or 54% of the total, and the cost of limited english proficiency education, which amounted to another $279 million, or nearly 11% of the total. those figures didn't distinguish between children born in the u.s. (and, thus, u.s. citizens) whose parents were in the country illegally, and immigrant children who are not u.s. citizens.\n\nfair also included in its estimate the $259 million cost of providing medicaid to the u.s.-born children of undocumented immigrants, who, again, are citizens.\n\narizona's undocumented population has decreased considerably in both number and share since 2010, according to estimates by pew, which means the costs of illegal immigration to arizona taxpayers has also likely fallen.\n\non an arizona murder\n\nwhat trump said: democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives, trump said, citing a phoenix case where an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, and then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he lay dying in the street. trump said the shooter had previously been deported after serving six years in prison.\n\nthe facts: trump was referring to 26-year-old victor garcia, an unauthorized immigrant who was charged with shooting 34-year-old jesus valazquez last year. garcia had served six years in an arizona prison after being convicted of aggravated assault in 2011, and had previously been deported.\n\naccording to court documents, garcia had a handgun and fired several shots at valazquez, who fell to the ground shortly after being struck. multiple witnesses saw garcia approach valazquez and shoot him three or four times in the face while he was still on the ground.\n\nthe border\n\non illegal border crossings\n\nwhat trump said: trump said his administration had reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. he said illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and january saw the fewest illegal crossings in two years.\n\nthe facts: since reaching a peak of 132,856 border apprehensions in may 2019, the number of migrants agents encountered along the u.s.-mexico border has continued to decrease significantly, according to customs and border protection, the agency responsible for patrolling the nation's borders.\n\nin january, agents apprehended 29,200 migrants along the border, a 78% decrease compared with may's peak. it's also the fewest number of migrants detained at the border since february 2018, when agents apprehended 26,666 people.\n\nthe pressure trump exerted on the mexican government this past summer to stop central americans traveling through the country on the way to the u.s. to claim asylum was a key factor in the drop. mexico deployed its national guard and has vastly increased the number of central american migrants it apprehends and deports.\n\nthe trump administration also implemented policies restricting access to asylum for latin american migrants. in january 2019, the department of homeland security rolled out its migrant protection protocols, also known as remain in mexico. more than 60,000 people have been sent back to await the outcome of their proceedings.\n\non 'catch and release'\n\nwhat trump said: the president said his administration ended the practice of catch and release, referring to the release of asylum seekers to the care of relatives already living in the u.s. with a notice to appear in court at a later date.\n\nthe facts: in september, then-acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan announced an end to catch and release. but, since then, dhs has continued to release hundreds of asylum seekers into the interior of the country.\n\nwhat has changed: the u.s. government has generally not released migrants from central and latin america. they are, for the most part, sent back to mexico under the migrant protection protocols or to guatemala under an agreement with the u.s. to take in asylum seekers — even though guatemala is one of the countries where most people are fleeing gang violence and poverty.\n\naccording to teresa cavendish, the director of tucson migrant shelter casa alitas, dhs has continued to release an average of 20 people a day in tucson alone. the families still being released are mexican asylum seekers, outside the hemisphere, families with children under one year of age, pregnant women six months or more, and significant illnesses or injuries, she said.\n\non border wall progress\n\nwhat trump said: the president said progress on the border wall was moving faster than ever, and we will soon be almost one new mile a day.\n\nthe facts: customs and border protection said construction crews have built 119 miles of border wall along the u.s.-mexico border since trump took office. the administration's goal is to complete a total of 450 miles by the end of 2020, meaning they have 330 miles left to build with 315 days left in the year.\n\nthe trump administration already redirected nearly $6 billion in funds from the defense department to cbp to build approximately 300 miles of new border barriers. it has also signaled intentions to divert $3.8 billion from the pentagon. this week, dhs issued waivers to expedite construction along 177 miles along the entire southwest u.s. border.\n\nin other words: cbp generally has the money needed to start building the remaining 330 miles of border wall. but other projects are happening at the same time, and the agency has not committed to the mile-a-day pace.\n\neconomic prosperity\n\non unemployment\n\nwhat trump said: unemployment has reached its lowest rate in over 51 years, half a century, the president said. he also said the average unemployment rate under his administration is the lowest for any president in u.s. history.\n\nthe facts: the unemployment rate, 3.5% in december, is indeed at its lowest in decades. the average unemployment rate during trump's first 35 months was 3.9%, compared with an average monthly rate of 7.4% under barack obama, 5.3% under george w. bush and 5.2% under bill clinton.\n\nhowever, employment records haven't been kept for the entire history of the country — that began in the 1950s. unemployment likely was lower during world war ii, with so many people working as part of the military.\n\non the economy at large\n\nwhat trump said: the president boasted that our economy is the best it has ever been.\n\nthe facts: best ever is subjective.\n\nif trump was referring to household net worth, the unemployment rate or the number of jobs created, it's likely true. by other measures, such as the country's gross domestic product, it is not so.\n\naccording to the most recent official estimate, gdp grew by 2.3% last year. it grew 2.9% in 2018 and in 2015, before trump took office. it grew 3.8% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.\n\na slowdown is expected this year: a recent wall street journal survey of business and university economists predicted an average of 1.9% gdp growth for this year.\n\nhealth care\n\non preexisting conditions\n\nwhat trump said: contending that democrats had failed on health care, trump said he is protecting people with preexisting conditions and that his administration always will.\n\nthe facts: protecting people with preexisting conditions by preventing insurance companies from denying them coverage is actually one of the most popular parts of the affordable care act, the health care law pushed by obama.\n\nchristopher robertson, a professor of law at the university of arizona and author of the 2019 book, exposed: why our health insurance is incomplete and what can be done about it, said trump's administration has not proposed, much less passed, any legislation of their own that would protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n\non prescription prices\n\nwhat trump said: trump said he is working with u.s. sen. martha mcsally, r-arizona, to lower prescription drug prices and that they are making a lot of progress. he also said his administration had approved a record number of generic drugs, which are much cheaper than non-generics.\n\nthe facts: it's true that, under trump's leadership, the food and drug administration has approved more generic drugs than in the past. that's one important mechanism for bringing down drug prices, but many of those approved generics have not actually made it to market, robertson said.\n\ntrump may be making progress on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but right now, that's hard to measure. there has been no substantial or sustained decrease in drug prices under the trump administration, robertson said, and high drug prices remain a persistent problem for americans and a top priority for candidates in the 2020 presidential race.\n\non health insurance plans\n\nwhat trump said: democrats gave americans the worst health care, and his administration is making health care better and much, much cheaper. the cost of plans has gone down under his leadership, he said.\n\nthe facts: it's true that americans can now buy insurance that's not compliant with the affordable care act, and they won't have to pay a financial penalty like they did under obama, as trump removed them.\n\nbut those non-compliant plans, often called skinny or junk plans, don't offer better health care. a consumer could buy one only to discover the plan does not cover health services they need, such as maternity care, mental health care, prescription drugs and preexisting conditions.\n\nthe price of premiums on the health care exchanges created by the affordable care act, which sell private insurance and allow consumers to qualify for federal subsidies to help pay for it, have stabilized in recent years. but trump has not supported those exchanges, commonly known as obamacare. under trump, funding for marketing and outreach to educate consumers about obamacare plans has been slashed, and the enrollment period has shortened.\n\non life expectancy\n\nwhat he said: life expectancy is rising again in the u.s.\n\nthe facts: trump is correct. a report from the national center for health statistics said that in 2018, life expectancy in the u.s. rose for the first time in four years.\n\nexperts say it's too early to tell whether this is a trend, however, and people in other high-income countries tend to live longer than people in the u.s.\n\nrecent data from the organization for economic cooperation and development shows that life expectancy from birth in the u.s. is 78.6 years old. that's worse than 28 other countries.\n\nrepublic reporters russ wiles, adrienne dunn and molly stellino contributed to this article.\n\nsupport local journalism. subscribe to azcentral.com today.
sen. kamala harris, the democratic vice presidential nominee, urged voters monday to rally against president donald trump's nominee to the supreme court nominee as a threat to health care and reproductive rights, and vote against republicans in the coming election.\n\nharris, d-calif., implored voters to pay attention to the voting on trump's nominee, federal appeals judge amy coney barrett, because she could help overturn the life's work of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg for equal rights. harris argued that barrett would work to overturn the affordable care act and an earlier high court decision that established a right to abortion.\n\nboth parties are using barrett's nomination to rally support. the republican-controlled senate is expected to be able to confirm barrett. harris, a member of the judiciary committee, didn't talk about ways to prevent barrett's confirmation during the 19-minute speech at shaw university, a historically black college in raleigh, n.c.\n\nbut harris said voters should understand what barrett's ascension to the court would mean to current law and legal precedent, and use it as a rallying cry against trump and republican members of the senate on nov. 3.\n\nwe will not let the infection that president trump has injected into the presidency and into congress, that has paralyzed our politics and pitted americans against each other, spread to the united states supreme court, harris said. this election is about our democracy.\n\nginsburg, 87, died sept. 18. trump nominated barrett, 48, who serves on the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals and teaches at the university of notre dame, on saturday.\n\nthe judiciary committee scheduled barrett's confirmation hearing to begin oct. 12 and it is expected to last several days with opening statements from senators, questions and testimony from experts. trump has urged the senate to confirm barrett before the nov. 3 election.\n\nthey just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can, harris said. it's called raw power. but president trump and his party are about to learn something. they may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don't. the american people are the ones who have the power. you have the power.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, the democratic nominee for president, and other critics have warned that barrett could vote on the high court to overturn the affordable care act, which is nicknamed obamacare, and the decision called roe v. wade that established a right to abortion.\n\nbarrett has said she would follow the constitution and not legislate from the bench. she has criticized chief justice john roberts' decision upholding the affordable care act and the court's earlier decision in roe v. wade.\n\ntrump told a pennsylvania rally saturday that barrett would uphold god-given rights.\n\nharris said no other decision would dishonor and disrespect ginsburg's legacy than overturning roe v. wade. harris said striking down the affordable care act could jeopardize health insurance for 20 million people who participate in the program and for 100 million with pre-existing conditions who were assured of coverage under the law.\n\nharris also argued that voting rights could be at stake with barrett on the high court, after she said the court in 2013 gutted the heart of the voting rights act. she said texas, north carolina, alabama, mississippi each adopted discriminatory laws to suppress the vote after that decision.\n\nvote as if your life, your choice depends on it – because it does, harris said. he knows he can't win if the people vote. donald trump is weak so he is throwing up every roadblock he can to try to suppress the vote. we the people cannot let him get away with it.
andy slavitt\n\nexactly seven years ago thursday, after decades of effort to make health care available to all americans, the affordable care act was signed into law. now, in what house speaker paul ryan calls an act of mercy, the house is planning an anniversary vote to repeal it and, in addition, to radically alter the medicaid program that has been a staple of the national safety net since the 1960s. for members of congress, this is one of the most consequential votes they might ever face.\n\nfor millions of people, the affordable care act has meant access to regular medical care for the first time. and for tens of millions more, the aca protects us against being denied insurance because of a pre-existing medical condition or because we reached a lifetime cap.\n\na few years ago, i came from the private sector to lead the implementation of the aca after it got off to a rocky start. and i can say that while it's not perfect, the aca set us on a course of record progress in cost, quality and access to care and changed the lives of millions of people, many of whom i heard from every day.\n\nin comparison, the american health care act (ahca) pending in the house drives up the cost of individual insurance by an estimated 15% to 20% next year, according to the non-partisan congressional budget office, and higher for older and rural americans, to levels that can reach half of their income or more. about 24 million americans would become uninsured over the next decade, including 7 million who get insurance through their employers. medicaid funding would be cut by 25%, with hard caps put in place by the federal government. that would effectively ration care for millions of low- and moderate-income americans, from needy children to seniors in long-term care facilities.\n\nas more details play out publicly, the sponsors of the bill race against the clock. unlike the aca, which was debated vigorously in both houses of congress with 79 hearings in the house alone, repealing the aca and replacing it with the ahca has put house members in a difficult position of casting a vote with many unanswered questions.\n\nthe $6,500 question on health care: column\n\nmitch mcconnell: middle class families are counting on trump\n\nthe first and perhaps most obvious question is what will be the impact of the law on your district? estimates are that over 10 years, 55,000 people in each congressional district will lose their coverage. and if you're in a district with rural counties or older people, it could be much higher. because medicaid would be slashed by $880 billion, and that money flows to states and then directly to hospitals, physician practices, social workers and nursing homes, what would be the resulting impact on the community, on the opioid crisis, on employment?\n\nquite aware of all the potential harm in this bill, speaker ryan has said not to worry — there will be a second and third phase that will fix everything. it's right to question how much stock to place in this. it's a bit like your teenager bringing home an f in math but telling you not to worry because he's sure he will get an a on the next test.\n\nyet it's not clear there will be other tests, as these phases would depend on newfound bipartisanship and the questionable use of executive authority. rep. raul labrador, r-idaho, isn't convinced, calling it a fiction for anyone to believe that.\n\nas representatives watch senator after senator declare they won't vote for the bill without significant improvements, it's right for some in the house to question why they are being asked to take such a difficult vote.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nour health care plan for america: paul ryan\n\nthis will very likely be one of those votes that becomes harder to explain in retrospect, particularly if the results are as bad as it looks like they will be. the american medical association and a slew of other physician groups, along with nurses and hospital groups, patient groups and the aarp, are loudly warning of dire consequences for millions of americans if the bill passed. lawmakers will have a difficult time reverting to but we ran on repealing and replacing obamacare as justification at election time, as the ahca's coming higher deductibles and higher premiums are likely not what voters had in mind.\n\ni experienced these past few years what it's like when one party is entirely responsible for carrying out the law, and i don't recommend it to my republican colleagues. as gratifying as it was to make progress, it was infinitely harder without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\nas we reach the seventh year of a law that has done so much — but without the bipartisan collaboration the nation has needed — the best question for your member of congress is when is it time to slow down, abandon an ill-conceived bill, and reach across the aisle for a bipartisan solution?\n\nandy slavitt, a former health care industry executive, served as acting administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services from 2015 to 2017. follow him on twitter: @aslavitt\n\nyou can read diverse opinions from our board of contributors and other writers on the opinion front page, on twitter @usatopinion and in our daily opinion newsletter. to respond to a column, submit a comment to letters@usatoday.com.
washington – allowing federal funds to flow again to international groups that provide or refer patients for abortion services is the easy part of president joe biden's promise to reverse trump administration policies on reproductive health issues.\n\nbiden did that with a stroke of a pen thursday.\n\nundoing restrictions on u.s. clinics that provide abortion counseling or services will take more time, as would changing when employers can decline to include birth control in workers' health care plans.\n\npassing legislation to codify the right to an abortion and allowing low-income women to get government-funded abortions – which biden backed during his presidential campaign – face roadblocks in a closely divided congress.\n\nbiden's promise to appoint federal judges who support the supreme court's 1973 roe v. wade decision establishing abortion rights is a long-term effort that may not be as successful as president donald trump's judicial accomplishments.\n\nadvocates are eager for action, particularly after women played a crucial role in biden's victory. if only men had voted, trump would have won.\n\nwe really are pushing this administration, not just to undo the harm of the trump administration but to move us forward in really important ways, said gretchen borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the national women's law center.\n\nbiden, who took a more expansive position on reproductive health issues during the campaign than he had in the past, frames his views in the context of one of his top priorities: creating a more equitable society for people of color and other marginalized groups.\n\nwe are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, biden said in a joint statement with vice president kamala harris recognizing the 48th anniversary of roe v. wade last week.\n\nexecutive orders:biden addresses racial bias in housing, directs doj to phase out use of private prisons\n\nbiden's emphasis is appropriate, said amanda roberti, a political science professor at san francisco state university who studies reproductive justice issues.\n\nwhen we look at the communities that are most affected by restrictive reproductive policies, you're talking about the most marginalized communities, she said.\n\nanthony fauci, biden's top medical adviser, told the world health organization last week that the united states would revoke the mexico city policy – which blocked funding to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs – as part of a broader commitment to protect women's health and advance gender equality at home and around the world.\n\ntrump restored and expanded the mexico city policy, which was started by the reagan administration and has been turned off and on again, depending on whether a democrat or republican held the white house.\n\ntitle x funding\n\nin addition to signing an order rescinding that policy thursday, biden began the process of undoing a similar restriction on domestic groups.\n\ntrump effectively blocked clinics from receiving federal family planning grants through title x if they offered abortion services with other funds. trump changed the rules on counseling, including barring referrals for abortion services. since those changes, about one-quarter of clinics and other providers that had received federal grants to help the uninsured or low-income patients no longer participate, according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.\n\nsix states withdrew entirely from the title x network: hawaii, maine, oregon, utah, vermont and washington.\n\nmost of the title x clinics in seven other states – alaska, connecticut, illinois, maryland, minnesota, new york and new hampshire – left the program.\n\nthe number of clients served by the program dropped by about 840,000 – or 21%.\n\nthough clinics didn't close because they had other funding sources, services were curtailed, said alina salganicoff, director of women's health policy for the kaiser family foundation.\n\nhours are often restricted so that it is much harder to get an appointment, she said. the waits are longer.\n\nrestoring the funding will require a months-long rules-writing process and new funding announcement.\n\nthis will likely be step one on a long road to rebuild the provider network, said audrey sandusky, a spokeswoman for the national family planning & reproductive health association.\n\ncontraception on health care plans\n\nbiden will need to use the regulatory process to simplify payment for abortion coverage that is part of health plans under the affordable care act and to make it harder for employers to opt out of including contraceptive services in their health plans for workers.\n\nwithout insurance, women can expect to pay $600 to $1,000 annually for oral contraception and more for longer-acting methods such as iuds.\n\ntrump allowed any employer with religious objections – and many with moral concerns – to bypass the affordable care act's requirement that insurance plans include birth control coverage.\n\nthere were multiple legal challenges to the aca's original workaround for religious organizations. the supreme court ruled in july that religious nonprofit groups, such as the little sisters of the poor, can keep contraceptive coverage off their plans instead of having insurers offer it directly to their employees.\n\nbiden called that ruling a disappointment and promised, if elected, to restore the obama-biden policy that existed before the court challenges.\n\nbiden withdrew his support for the hyde amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion in most cases. he backed codifying the right to an abortion as a backstop in case the newly reconfigured supreme court overturns or eviscerates roe v. wade.\n\nanti-abortion groups put the pressure on\n\nanti-abortion groups, which lauded trump as the most pro-life president in the nation's history, have started to fight back.\n\nnow is no time to give in, not when we're this close, marjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, wrote in a fox news opinion piece last week.\n\nthough democrats control both chambers of congress, they have the narrowest of majorities in the senate and don't have enough votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nthe susan b. anthony group spent $200,000 on radio ads pressuring west virginia sen. joe manchin – one of the few anti-abortion democrats in congress – to continue supporting the hyde amendment and opposing eliminating the filibuster.\n\nthe senate filibuster is the only thing standing between us and the pro-abortion agenda of the washington liberals, an announcer says in the west virginia ads. thankfully, sen. joe manchin is standing strong for life.\n\nborchelt, of the national women's law center, said reproductive rights advocates have to be realistic about the numbers that we have in congress, but lawmakers can lay the groundwork for changes by introducing legislation and holding hearings.\n\nas for whether biden can catch up to trump on judicial appointments, that remains to be seen.\n\nit's certainly true that we're facing a federal judiciary that trump was able to transform, borchelt said. and that damage is going to be long-lasting.\n\nmore:biden prioritizes climate change as national security concern
adam brandon\n\nopinion contributor\n\nten years have passed since the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act, better known as obamacare, and the law has been more or less fully deployed for six.\n\nin practice, although it may have made health care more accessible to some, it did so at the cost of making it less affordable and worse quality for many others.\n\non one hand, obamacare definitely did reduce the number of americans without health insurance. on the other, it also massively increased insurance premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for millions of americans. thanks to insurers narrowing their networks and many fleeing obamacare's exchanges, many of us who liked our doctors, or our insurance plans, didn't get to keep either.\n\nin practice, obamacare's main thrust was a radical centralization of health care. the core of any marketplace is competition and price signals, and these have been nearly entirely obscured across much of the health care system by government mandates that favor inserting third parties between health care providers and patients. obamacare didn't invent these problems, but it did increase them.\n\ninstead of (unconstitutionally) subjecting everyone to a one-size-fits-all health insurance plan with deductibles so high that people can't afford to use them, health care reform should allow for a diversity of choices.\n\nour view:with coronavirus pandemic raging, it would be insane to kill obamacare\n\nlet people compete with the current model by keeping more of their own earnings to spend on health care services of their choice, tax free. remove barriers to competition that promote hospital monopolies and shortages of care. reform government-provided payments under medicare to focus on quality, not quantity, of care. stop encouraging states to overspend on medicaid and incentivize them to find better ways to care for the poor.\n\nin 10 years, obamacare has inexorably steered health care toward bureaucracy, stagnation and eventually total government control. the way forward now, better late than never, is innovation, competition and choice.\n\nadam brandon is the president of freedomworks.\n\nif you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
chrissie thompson\n\nthe cincinnati enquirer\n\ncolumbus, ohio — welcome to the general election, ohio-style. twenty-four hours. two candidates. one state that can deliver the white house.\n\none candidate rolled in sunday, more than 90 minutes late to an outdoor party with several thousand people, complete with '90s music and many campaign themes from that decade, too. her selling point: a traditional approach to politics — with policy plans and heavy fundraising — from the first woman to win a major-party nomination.\n\na day later and a mile away, the other candidate was more punctual. he reached out to his 1,000-person crowd, seated in the round with his podium in the middle, with a more personal, visceral appeal. to raised hands: who sent in checks? wow! to an audience question about stopping heroin: build a wall. to all who would listen: an outsider candidacy, shunning a request for more specific plans and flaunting his use of twitter, consequences be damned.\n\nhillary clinton and democratic party raise nearly $90 million\n\neach found supportive voters in ohio's capital city, from a child who hoped to give the democrat a hand-drawn picture to the republican vips in suits, waving like children at their political hero. underneath both crowds' enthusiasm: a tension.\n\nwhy, hillary clinton's supporters wondered aloud, is the democrat tied with donald trump in ohio, when she is so experienced and his rhetoric is so divisive? when, the trump supporters wondered, will the real-estate-mogul-turned-republican-nominee focus on the concrete plans and grassroots organization they think could deliver him the election in the quintessential swing-state?\n\nfor clinton and her supporters, the solution is more of the same.\n\ni have specific plans about how we're going to get the economy working for everybody, clinton said, talking about spending money on bridges and a new electric grid to put people back to work. i view this campaign as a giant job interview. i'm here telling you what kind of president i would be and asking for your vote.\n\nthe pitch was so predictable that trump mocked it the next day: we're going to build new roads; we're going to build new schools, he monotoned.\n\nclinton, trump show stark contrast on climate change\n\nclinton fired back in her own way: i want people to make an informed choice, she said sunday. i personally think donald trump poses a threat to our democracy.\n\nsurely, supporters said, if clinton keeps this up, it will sink in, and the polls will change.\n\ni don't know, said hugh crowell, 58, an environmental scientist from columbus. the line that they're taking of just very gently pointing out that trump is a potential demagogue seems to be carrying a lot of weight. i think people are listening, gradually, and i think they'll come around to that.\n\ndonald trump just called hillary clinton 'the devil'\n\nyet clinton is struggling to win over a usually reliable part of the democratic base: working-class voters, many of whom have embraced trump's anti-trade stances.\n\nahead of her weekend trip through northeast ohio and down into columbus, clinton's campaign quietly removed the cliche label from her so-called rust belt tour, in an attempt to sweeten her appeal to blue-collar buckeyes. meanwhile, trump boisterously embraced the term, declaring to the residents of the rust belt: everything's rusting and rotting.\n\nthose of you who don't have work? hang in there, he said later. jobs will be back sooner than you think.\n\neverything about trump's visit monday oozed swagger and muscle. he opened by blaming his smaller crowd monday on a fire department motivated by politics. thousands of people could have fit in the largely empty convention hall, he said, although the line of people dismissed outside numbered only in the few hundreds. the fire department said the campaign had agreed days earlier to a crowd of 1,000.\n\nsome of his supporters lauded his signature approach.\n\nthe country needs to change. i'm sick of politics, and he's a businessman, said greenfield's phyllis matlack, 64, a retiree who owns rental properties.\n\nformer top christie aide backing clinton over trump\n\nstill, trump's approach risks alienating another swath of ohioans: moderates and conservatives in the state who are used to candidates focused on policy and who find his controversial rhetoric off-putting.\n\nat least, trump's supporters said, he didn't bring up his tussle over the weekend with the parents of fallen veteran humayun khan, a muslim, whose father excoriated trump and his immigration proposals at the democratic national convention last week. trump fired back, suggesting khan's mother had remained silent at the convention because she was not allowed to speak and insisting he had sacrificed for his country, despite khan's father's comparison to his family's grief. he kept the attack up on twitter, saying he had been viciously attacked, as veterans around the country expressed dismay.\n\nfor ohio voters, i'd like to see him lay out a plan, said steve howard, 61, a retired police officer from columbus. plus, he said, despite the khan comments and the rhetoric about keeping out radical islamic terrorists, trump seems tolerant of all people.\n\ni would like to see him hammering that in, howard said. of the khan comments, he said: unfortunately, it did look bad. ... i think about the best thing he can do is clarify it and move on.\n\nperhaps responding to ohio republicans' desire for a plan, trump's event was set up like a town-hall meeting. at the end of his typically wide-ranging speech, he took three questions.\n\nvoters asked him to share his plans to repeal president obama's health care law and help small businesses. trump didn't share details of his obamacare replacement, saying: we have something coming that i think is going to be great. of help for small businesses, he said: we're going to cut down the regulations, i would bet, between 85 and 90 percent.\n\nas uproar spirals, trump plans wisconsin trip\n\nthat approach differs from clinton's list of policy cornerstones. her speech nevertheless included typical political platitudes, from taking on the gun lobby to making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. she's not campaigning on a budget rollout.\n\nshe is campaigning in part on her effort to become the nation's first woman president. that quest galvanized her supporters.\n\ntrump harassment remarks called 'victim blaming'\n\numbisa gusa, who has dual citizenship in kenya and the u.s., listed historic moments in his lifetime. he saw an african president elected in south africa. he saw kenya gain its independence from great britain.\n\ni have seen a lot in 70 years. this is the most important event that i'm looking forward to, gusa said. after 240 years, a woman is ready (to be president). we need the new generation of americans to believe you can make it.\n\nthat spirit was contagious at clinton's rally. as a 4-year-old girl skipped away from the event, she chanted to herself: hillary! hillary!\n\nfollow chrissie thompson on twitter: @cthompsonenq
andy slavitt\n\nopinion columnist\n\ndonald trump's deregulation presidency has been an aggressive assault on the protections americans need in order to live healthier lives. he may have gotten a boost last week with the sudden resignation of his food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb — a conservative but serious-minded reformer who was willing to embrace regulations on vaping and tobacco companies and to publicly call out the pricing tricks of pharmaceutical companies.\n\nthe trump administration's view is that when it comes to our health, we don't need more protections, we need fewer things getting in the way of allowing companies to do as they please. fossil fuel companies have enjoyed not only the lowering of clean air and water standards, but former industry lobbyists have taken over writing the rules at the environmental protection agency.\n\nlikewise, the consumer protections in the affordable care act, such as those put in place to protect the tens of millions of americans with pre-existing conditions, have been undermined by new unregulated insurance, permitted and promoted by trump. with these junk insurance policies, insurance companies decide whom not to cover, what not to cover and how much to charge — with nothing to stop them. even state regulators who want to maintain consumer protections are becoming a target of federal officials racing to remove those standards.\n\nread more commentary:\n\nafter obamacare ruled unconstitutional, profit-driven critics risk our 1-year-old son's life\n\ntrump's sotu health care talk is a smokescreen to make us forget his miserable record\n\non medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges?\n\ntrump likes to trumpet his deregulation push as liberating the economy from bureaucrats. but this is not red tape that small businesses are caught up in. these are consumer protections meant to ensure that massively profitable multibillion dollar companies meet minimum standards. the economy, in fact, benefits from stronger health insurance protections so people with family illnesses can leave their companies to start new businesses.\n\nbut trump doesn't dislike all regulations. at the same time he is lifting regulations on fossil fuel and health care companies, he is imposing new regulations on individuals —particularly those with lower incomes. to qualify for medicaid, low-income workers in seven states face new regulations requiring them to fill out forms logging their hours worked. failure to comply results in the loss of medicaid coverage entirely. in arkansas alone, since these new regulations have been in place, more than 18,000 people have already lost their insurance for failing to comply with these new regulations. trump wants people who receive benefits from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which provide food to hungry kids, to be similarly regulated.\n\nwhile he makes people jump through hoops, for companies that want to deny coverage to someone with a sick child or make it prohibitively expensive, trump aims to make that more possible than ever.\n\ngottlieb exit a setback for consumers\n\nagainst this backdrop, last week's surprise announcement that gottlieb had tendered his resignation is a setback for consumers and potentially a bad sign for the future. gottlieb was unusual in this administration for his repeated willingness to stand up for the american public against powerful pharmaceutical, tobacco and vaping companies and has been unafraid to stake out new regulation as an important part of that effort.\n\nhe was hardly abandoning his conservative credentials. but early in his tenure, as data mounted about the dramatic increases in teenage nicotine addiction from vaping, gottlieb saw the makings of what he described as an epidemic, and he became something of an accidental activist regulator. he issued more than 1,300 warning letters and fines for those who sold e-cigarettes to minors and even took the rare and admirable step of publicly adjusting his prior views when faced with new information.\n\nhe had begun the process of sharply curtailing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes targeting minors, had announced support for banning menthol cigarettes, and was on a path toward reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes.\n\nholding companies accountable\n\ngottlieb wasn't stopping with nicotine. he was beginning to take a harder line on dietary supplements and opioid prescribing limits, and was actively implementing food and calorie-labeling laws passed during the obama administration. and he was outspoken on the high cost of prescription drugs and called the industry to account for underhanded practices that delayed the availability of lower-cost generic medicines. he even publicly named names of those who in his words game the system and exploit loopholes. like all good regulators, he wasn't out to get companies, just to hold them accountable to the public.\n\nwhen he announced his resignation last week, he was still very much in the middle of these efforts, and much remains to be decided.\n\npushing for change against opposition from industry and some conservatives is a tough job. it's unclear whether gottlieb had enough administration support for some of his far-reaching reforms. if not, this will mark victories for the vaping and tobacco industries, and this might have influenced his decision to leave.\n\nas much as trump would have it otherwise, our system doesn't work without regulators willing to take on companies that put their profits ahead of the public. when those companies put the health and safety of kids and our access to life-saving medications at risk, we need regulators who will write the rules that will protect the public. when our government agencies can't or won't do that, it's another sign that we need a change in the oval office.\n\nandy slavitt, a member of usa today's board of contributors, is a former

eliza collins\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — republicans have some serious pick-up opportunities in the senate — so why do they keep giving ammunition to democrats?\n\nthere are more than two dozen senate democrats and independents up for re-election in november. ten of those are in states president trump won, five of those by double-digits with the margin of victory going as high as 42 percentage points. that's compared to just nine gop-held seats that are up; and only four of those are considered even slightly competitive.\n\nyet, the trump administration and republican lawmakers have been prone to say things that are unhelpful to the candidates they back or legislation they championed. this week alone, the vice president praised a controversial former sheriff in arizona who is running against a sitting gop congresswoman. and a former trump cabinet official and sitting gop senator criticized republicans' major legislative achievement, tax reform.\n\nformer sheriff joe arpaio is a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law, vice president mike pence said at a tax event in tempe, ariz. tuesday night. i'm honored to have you here. pence said. he did not give the same level of praise to rep. martha mcsally, one of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's key recruits who republican and democratic strategists say has the best chance of beating likely democratic candidate rep. kyrsten sinema.\n\narpaio is arizona's controversial former sheriff who was found guilty of criminal contempt for flagrant disregard of a federal judge's order in a racial-profiling case but was pardoned by president trump, against the wishes of some prominent republicans.\n\narpaio is now running for the republican nomination for sen. jeff flake's senate seat. flake announced he would not seek re-election after it became clear his criticism of the president had cost him the path to the nomination. but establishment republicans want mcsally to represent the party in the general, instead of arpaio or former state senator kelli ward, who was backed by steve bannon. while pence's praise of arpaio was more effusive, he did mention mcsally as one of a list of great conservative representatives' and attended a fundraiser with mcsally later tuesday.\n\nbruce haynes said pence's comments about arpaio are the type of thing that could be used as a semi-endorsement in the gop primary where both the president and vice president hold sway. haynes is a republican strategist and who worked on the republican national committee's 2008 presidential independent expenditure campaign.\n\nthat's something that you see on a television screen in a 30-second-ad, haynes said.\n\nby wednesday afternoon arpaio was touting pence's words: i was humbled by the kind words from @vp and the standing ovations from the packed house at the @americafirstpol rally yesterday.\n\ni think the trump administration propping up people like joe arpaio is not helpful to the republican party, said alex conant, a gop strategist. if mcsally is our nominee we have a good chance of keeping the seat. if it's anybody else, the democrats will pick up at least one seat.\n\nmike pence's all-but-endorsement of joe arpaio proves that there is no end in sight for the divisive and increasingly nasty fight for the gop nomination, said drew anderson, the spokesman for the arizona democrats.\n\npence isn't the only one to take away mojo from the gop senate candidates. three sitting gop senators have praised the democrats running in their states, even if they've said they'll ultimately back the republican candidate.\n\nsen. bob corker, who is retiring at the end of this year, said he had no plans to campaign against the democrat running to replace him in tennessee. corker went so far as to say that former democratic gov. phil bredesen would be good at almost anything he put his mind to doing.\n\nconant, who is a former aide to rubio, said it's not unusual for senators to decline to campaign against their colleagues because they have to work together in the senate. nelson didn't go after rubio in 2016, conant pointed out.\n\nmeanwhile, some republicans have bashed their signature legislative accomplishment.\n\non tuesday, former health and human services secretary tom price who had been a key administration official during republican efforts to repeal and replace obamacare last year, said that getting rid of the individual mandate — the requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty — would likely make costs go up for people who remain in the marketplace.\n\nwhile republicans were trying to repeal the health care law, price said the individual mandate was behind the rise in premium costs. gop lawmakers failed to get rid of the affordable care act in full, but they did nix the individual mandate in their tax reform bill which passed late last year.\n\nsen. marco rubio, who is not up for re-election but is a prominent gop voice, said in a recent interview with the economist, that the $1.5 trillion tax bill — which he voted for in december — has yet to deliver the relief to the working class, despite the breaks given to fortune 500 companies.\n\nthere's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the american worker, rubio said.\n\nby wednesday both price and rubio had walked back the remarks.\n\nin an op-ed for national review published wednesday, rubio said on the whole, the tax cut bill helps workers. it's just not massive tax cuts to multinational corporations that do it.\n\nand in a statement through the job creators network, a pro-business group where he is a health care fellow, price said repealing the individual mandate was exactly the right thing to do. forcing americans to buy something they don't want undermines individual liberty as well as free markets, according to politico.\n\nbut democrats had already seized on the comments.\n\none by one, republican faithful are coming out of the woodwork to bemoan the gop tax bill's negative impact on average americans, the north dakota democratic party's alex rich said after price and rubio's comments. north dakota sen. heidi heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable democrats up for re-election this year.\n\nthe democratic senatorial campaign committee, the senate democrats' campaign arm called the comments the republicans' 'i-accidentally-told-the-truth moments.'\n\nhaynes, the republican strategist, dismissed the comments as nothing more than a nuisance that would suck up precious campaign time up, but wouldn't do long-term damage.\n\nthe biggest value for the democrats is that it disrupts a news cycle and throws you off your message, haynes said. it'll take (republican candidates) off message for a day or two but there's no real long term damage.\n\nfrank luntz, a republican pollster, was asked about the comments over the past week and responded by saying the real issue for republicans comes when president trump bashes congress and gop legislation.\n\nluntz said base voters take that as a message to kick out members of the republican establishment. luntz pointed to trump's criticisms of the house republicans' repeal bill — which the president called mean — and the spending bill which trump unhappily signed in march\n\nevery time that donald trump attacks congress,10,000 of his voters decide to vote for the democrats, luntz said. every time trump attacks the democrats in congress, they do exactly the opposite.\n\nthe president doesn't realize that his own base hears his attack against congress as an attack against republican leadership, he said.\n\ncontributing: yvonne wingett sanchez from arizona and ledge king in

christy bieber\n\nthe motley fool\n\nleaving your job can mean making some big life changes. it's important that you're prepared so those changes don't cause you to experience financial hardship or put your future at risk.\n\nthe good news is, you can make a checklist to ensure that transitioning to new employment is simple and easy. just take care of these five financial to-dos so the job switch is a seamless one.\n\n1. get the right health insurance coverage in place\n\nleaving your job often means losing your health insurance. ideally your new company will have a policy you can sign up for, but there's no guarantee that will happen. even if your new company has a policy in place, there may be a waiting period before you become eligible for it.\n\nyou have a few options to maintain coverage when you leave one job and don't immediately get covered at another. you could keep your current coverage under cobra but will have to begin paying full premiums if your employer was subsidizing coverage. or you could sign up for a plan on the individual market.\n\nlosing workplace coverage is a qualifying life event that will allow you to sign up for a plan on the obamacare exchange even outside open enrollment. that means you could be eligible for subsidies to help you afford coverage. be sure to look into that option, because it may be cheaper than cobra coverage.\n\n2. collect any accrued vacation time or sick days\n\nif you earned vacation or sick days at work, you're probably entitled to a payout for the value of those days if you didn't use them. make sure you talk to your employer about the policies and process of collecting pay for these unused days, because you could otherwise miss out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars of income you're owed.\n\n3. decide what to do about your workplace retirement plans\n\nif you were invested in a workplace 401(k), you have a few options. you could keep it where it is, you could roll it over to an ira, or you could roll it over into your new employer's 401(k).\n\nin most cases, keeping the money where it is seems simplest – but if your previous employer's plan is shutting down or if your balance is too small, that isn't always an option. even if you could keep your account where it is, you should still consider whether that's the best approach. you may be able to get more investment choices or lower fees by rolling the funds over to an ira or new 401(k), so be sure to compare the terms of each plan.\n\ndon't forget to sign up for 401(k) contributions at your new workplace as well!\n\n4. adjust your budget for your new salary\n\nif your salary is changing at your new job, you should adjust your budget accordingly.\n\nideally, if your salary is bigger, you won't adjust your spending upward and get used to living on more. instead, you should divert some or all of your extra money to retirement savings or other savings goals. that way you'll never get used to the extra money and you can set yourself up for the future.\n\nif your salary is declining, on the other hand, you should change your spending habits right away so you don't end up in debt because you haven't adjusted your lifestyle to match your new reality.\n\n5. put some cash in the bank to help you through the transition\n\ndepending on when you leave your old job and when your new job starts, it's possible you'll go several weeks without a paycheck – especially because many companies pay biweekly, so you may have to work for a while at your new position before your first check comes in.\n\ntry to save a few thousand dollars in the bank to make sure you have cash to see you through until your new paycheck arrives. if you don't end up needing this money, you can transfer it into savings or use it to pay expenses associated with your new job, such as upgrading your wardrobe for a position of more responsibility.\n\nstart your own business:a good first step is picking a good partner\n\nsaving money:there's no secret; 7 tricks that actually work\n\nchanging jobs doesn't have to create financial challenges\n\nif you're organized, prepared, and ready to transition from one job to another, the change should go easy. just make sure you check off the items on this to-do list so you don't risk your retirement future or put yourself at risk of catastrophic financial loss because of a health problem while you have a gap in insurance coverage.\n\nthe motley fool owns and recommends mastercard and visa, and recommends american express. we're firm believers in the golden rule. if we wouldn't recommend an offer to a close family member, we wouldn't recommend it on the ascent either. our number one goal is helping people find the best offers to improve their finances. that is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers. editorial content from the ascent is separate from the motley fool editorial content and is created by a different analyst team.\n\nthe motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives. its content is produced independently of usa today.\n\nsavings account rates are skyrocketing – earn 25x your bank\n\noffer from the motley fool: many people are missing out on guaranteed returns as their money languishes in a big bank savings account earning next to no interest. our picks of the best online savings accounts can earn you more than 25x the national average savings account rate. click here to uncover the best-in-class picks that landed a spot on our shortlist of the best savings accounts for 2019.
ronna mcdaniel\n\nwhen president obama signed the affordable care act seven years ago, he saddled americans with a healthcare system that put the ultra-liberal agenda ahead of our best interests. we were promised that obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. we were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. we were promised that obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. instead, the law brought the american people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. we were let down.\n\nthen, in 2014, nancy pelosi sought to defend the collapsing law by claiming its success should be measured by the number of people who had access to affordable healthcare and its ability to lower skyrocketing costs.\n\nby pelosi's own standards, obamacare has been an unmitigated failure.\n\nthis year alone, obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. under the two most popular obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median american household income. this is not affordable.\n\nobama's promise of choice has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. no one can deny obamacare is in a 'death spiral' when the number of americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year. this is not choice.\n\npaul ryan: our plan offers more choices\n\nthe republican reckoning on health care: jill lawrence\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nour families can no longer afford to support an expensive, unsustainable healthcare system, but for years democrats ignored the warnings that obamacare would increase the deficit. it was clear democrats realized opposition to the healthcare law was growing when they wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars last year alone in an attempt to rescue obamacare's plummeting popularity. even still, they refuse to acknowledge the legislation is hurting the very people they claimed to help.\n\nunlike the democrats, republicans and trump are listening to the american people and promised to repeal and replace this disaster. they have worked together to introduce legislation in congress that ensures americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. republican-led reforms would help americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, so that they can get a plan that works for them, not a one-size-fits-all plan forced on them by the government. our families would have the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will drastically reduce costs and provide far better care.\n\neven the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects this new healthcare legislation would cut our federal deficit by $337 billion. while obamacare drove up premiums, the republican-led healthcare reforms would lower premiums by 10%. obamacare forced small business layoffs, but the repeal and replace bill would lower taxes by $883 billion. these are real reforms that our country needs, and stands in sharp contrast to the out of control spending obamacare inflicted on our economy.\n\nthough this new legislation would benefit those they represent, democrats are digging in their heels in the name of partisanship and preserving obama's failed legacy.\n\nthanks to a unified republican government, i am confident that republicans in congress will deliver on their promises to the american people and bring positive change to our broken healthcare system.\n\nronna mcdaniel is chair of the rnc. follow her on twitter @rrmgop\n\nyou can read diverse opinions from our board of contributors and other writers on the opinion front page, on twitter @usatopinion and in our daily opinion newsletter. to respond to a column, submit a comment to letters@usatoday.com.
washington – president joe biden on thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of former president donald trump, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on abortion and family planning services.\n\nbiden signed an executive order for the department of health and human services to reopen insurance enrollment on healthcare.gov from feb. 15 through may 15, giving a new coverage opportunity to americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic. the annual open enrollment for the plans ended in december in most states.\n\nnearly 9 million uninsured americans could get free or subsidized health insurance through the special enrollment period, according to the kaiser family foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization.\n\nwhite house press secretary jen psaki declined to estimate how many people might take advantage of the opportunity.\n\ntrump resisted calls for a special enrollment period for people who became uninsured during the pandemic and repeatedly sought to repeal the affordable care act, the obama administration's signature health care reform law. the aca, or obamacare, provides health insurance to more than 23 million people.\n\nbiden said his actions are designed to undo the damage trump has done.\n\nthere's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the affordable care act and restoring the medicaid to the way it was before trump became president, biden said. as we continue to battle covid-19, it's even more critical americans have meaningful access to health care.\n\nhe also directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the affordable care act, make it difficult for americans to enroll in medicaid or ones that reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nsusan bailey, president of the american medical association, applauded the moves, saying they will restore coverage to patients who are victims of the economic fallout of the pandemic.\n\nthrough an outreach campaign expected to include advertising and partnerships with local organizations, the administration hopes to enroll people who may not be aware they're eligible for coverage.\n\nlarry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation, tweeted that biden's actions signal a dramatically different direction from the last four years.\n\nbut, levitt added, there are a lot of details to be worked out and decisions to be made, which will in some cases take months if not years.\n\nending the 'global gag rule'\n\nas the initial steps in biden's pledge to stop the relentless and extreme attack on reproductive health, the president issued a memorandum to revoke the mexico city policy, which blocks foreign assistance to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs.\n\ntrump both restored and expanded that policy, which was started by the reagan administration and has been turned off and on again depending on whether a democrat or republican holds the white house. critics call it the global gag rule.\n\nsenate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., criticized the move, saying it will run over the consciences of american taxpayers and put them back on the hook for funding abortions overseas.\n\nbiden began the process of undoing similar restrictions on domestic groups that receive federal family planning funds to serve the uninsured and low-income populations.\n\nthe number of clients served by the program dropped by about 840,000 – or 21% – after the trump administration changed the rules for receiving title x grants, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nbiden directed the department of health and human services to review those changes. the agency would need to write new regulations to undo the trump rules.\n\nadvocates for reproductive rights are pushing the new administration to go beyond simply reversing trump administration actions affecting abortion services and put in place new protections and expanded services.\n\nit's a great start, alexis mcgill johnson, head of the planned parenthood federation of america, said of biden's actions. but, i'll emphasize again, this is a start. we need to both undo the damage of the next four years and move policy and our collective imagination forward.\n\ntackling reproductive rights:some of biden's goals are easier than others\n\nhealth care was a key issue for voters in the 2020 presidential election and helped democrats win back a majority in the house of representatives in the 2018 midterms.\n\nduring the campaign, biden didn't go as far as some progressives wanted in promising changes to the affordable care act. but he backed expanding insurance subsidies, lowering the eligibility age for medicare, and adding a government-run option that would compete against the private plans offered in the marketplace.\n\nthose changes would require passing legislation through a closely-divided congress.\n\nthe fate of the entire law, however, remains in the hands of the supreme court. in the latest legal challenge to obamacare brought by republicans, the court will decide whether congress' elimination in 2017 of the penalty imposed on consumers who refuse to buy health insurance invalidates the law.\n\nanother obamacare challenge:supreme court appears unlikely to topple affordable care act
ricardo alonso-zaldivar and mark sherman\n\nassociated press\n\nwashington — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the trump administration late thursday urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act.\n\nthe administration's last-minute filing, which was due on thursday for a case to be argued next fall, came the same day the government reported that close to half a million people who lost their health insurance amid the economic shutdown to slow the spread of covid-19 have gotten coverage through healthcare.gov.\n\nthe administration's legal brief makes no mention of the virus.\n\nsome 20 million americans could lose their health coverage and protections for people with preexisting health conditions also would be put at risk if the court agrees with the administration in a case that won't be heard before the fall.\n\nin the case before the supreme court, texas and other conservative-led states argue that the aca was essentially rendered unconstitutional after congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all americans have coverage.\n\nafter failing to repeal obamacare in 2017 when republicans fully controlled congress, president donald trump has put the weight of his administration behind the legal challenge.\n\nif the health insurance requirement is invalidated, then it necessarily follows that the rest of the aca must also fall, solicitor general noel francisco wrote thursday.\n\nthe trump administration's views on what parts of the aca might be kept or replaced if the law is overturned have shifted over time. but in legal arguments, it has always supported getting rid of obamacare provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.\n\nnonetheless, trump has repeatedly assured americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected. neither the white house nor congressional republicans have specified how.\n\nthe new sign-ups for health coverage come from the centers for medicare and medicaid services. the figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. major states like california and new york are not counted in the federal statistics.\n\nan estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback. people who lose employer health care are eligible for a special sign-up period for subsidized plans under the obama-era law. many may also qualify for medicaid.\n\nelection 2020::biden talks about trump's 'twin legacies', health care in swing-state pennsylvania trip\n\nthe trump administration has been criticized for not doing as much as states like california to publicize these readily available backups. in response, administration officials say they have updated the healthcare.gov website to make it easier for consumers to find information on special sign-up periods.\n\nthursday's report from the government showed that about 487,000 people signed up with healthcare.gov after losing their workplace coverage this year. that's an increase of 46% from the same time period last year.
jayne o'donnell\n\nusa today\n\ninsurers and hospitals can't discriminate against patients because of their gender identity under the affordable care act, federal officials said friday, but patient groups complained the rule doesn't go far enough.\n\nthe department of health and human services finalized a rule that prohibited discrimination in health care based on a long list of characteristics ranging from race to pregnancy, gender identity and sex stereotyping.\n\nit doesn't mean insurers have to cover all treatments associated with gender transitioning but they just can't outright deny them either. but the rule doesn't go far enough in clarifying what is discrimination, some say.\n\nwe are disappointed that hhs did not do a better job at specifically defining discrimination in plan benefit design, carl schmid, who heads the aids institute and represents the i am essential coalition of 197 patient groups, said in a statement. some insurance plans are finding ways to discriminate against patients, particularly those with chronic and serious health conditions.\n\nthe new rule came on the same day as the education department issued guidance to schools, telling that if they have sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students have to be able to participate according to their gender identity.\n\nthe move also comes as transgender bathroom use pits north carolina against the justice department over its law requiring people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. and it follows republican presidential candidate donald trump's announcement that caitlyn jenner could use any bathroom she wants in the building he owns.\n\nq&a: what does the department of education say about transgender bathrooms?\n\non health care, schmid said existing practices should be defined and clearly prohibited, but he said the groups are pleased hhs said it will review discriminatory practices on a case by case basis.\n\nthe law applies to health insurers, hospitals, and health plans administered by or receiving federal funds from hhs.
jill lawrence\n\nusa today opinion\n\nit's an axiom of the tv news business that if it bleeds, it leads, so it's no surprise that the bloodletting within the republican party is at the top of the charts these days. it's also true that good news is hardly considered news at all, even when it affects millions of people and undermines a core argument in a presidential race.\n\nthat is the case with the new bureau of labor statistics report on february employment: 242,000 new jobs, 555,000 more people joining the labor force, upward revisions in previous job statistics, and an unemployment rate steady at 4.9%. investors business daily called those blowout numbers. other news outlets used words like hefty, surprisingly strong, and a sign of the nation's economic durability.\n\nit may not always be apparent given the outsized role of size – of hands and other body parts – in the presidential campaign, but the republican candidates routinely claim that president obama's job-killing policies are destroying the country.\n\nthe friday jobs report is the latest data to cast doubt on this premise, at least from an economic standpoint. but except for financial publications, it was not featured on print front pages and by saturday morning had disappeared from home pages online. even more significant, there were no celebratory tweets about the jobs numbers from democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders. clinton's theme of the day, while glancingly acknowledging progress, was the need for more jobs and higher wages. sanders similarly said that despite gains, the american middle class has been declining for 40 years and railed against disastrous trade agreements.\n\nin other words, the glass is half-empty. that's not all that far from ted cruz's declaration in thursday's debate that people are struggling through seven years of barack obama.\n\nwildest and craziest campaign, or maybe not: column\n\nthere is no question that wage stagnation and income inequality remain major problems and major drivers of support for the sanders and trump candidacies. the new jobs report reminded us of that with data that showed a 3-cent-per-hour drop in hourly wages. still, that drop came after several months of increases and may be a blip rather than a trend.\n\nobama, making his own case into what turned out to be a vacuum, said the u.s. economy is the envy of the world and offered democrats the talking points they should be using: there seems to be an alternative reality out there from some of the political folks that america is down in the dumps. it's not. america is pretty darn great right now, and making strides right now.\n\nrepublicans are running on the notion that america is on the ropes and it's obama's fault. they blame him and his policies, particularly the affordable care act or obamacare, for a range of domestic ills including flat wages, high student debt, small businesses unable to survive and people forced into part-time work. much of this has been debunked, but that's been the gop narrative for years and it is unshakeable.\n\nthe evidence to fight these arguments is right in front of democrats, but they seem loath to engage. in the case of the latest jobs report, the problem may be timing, with primaries coming up in michigan and other states afflicted by the long-term manufacturing downturn (even as the new report showed an uptick). but the larger pattern is one we saw in 2012 and 2014.\n\ntrump is unfit to command the military: column\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nin 2012, right before their convention began, democrats could not bring themselves to say the country was better off than it had been four years earlier when obama took office — even though he was sworn in when america was in the grip of the great recession, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and headed to 10% unemployment, and the auto industry was in free fall. democratic strategists had decided it was best to play down progress so as not to offend what veteran operative chris lehane called angry-bird voters upset over the direction of their lives and the country.\n\neconomic conditions continued to improve, but democratic candidates in 2014 moved even further from the president. handed a blank canvas, republicans painted a bleak picture of a nation on the brink.\n\nthen, like now, that was largely at odds with objective reality. but it didn't matter – when the returns came in, republicans had picked up eight senate seats and control of the senate, and added another 13 seats to their already comfortable house majority. they also added two more governors for a total of 31, nearly twice the democrats' 17.\n\nrepublicans have had control of the discourse for months now, suggesting democrats have not fully absorbed the lessons of the past. if they don't want a repeat performance of 2014 in a year when the presidency is at stake, it's long past time to start offering their own sweeping narrative of pride, patriotism and success.\n\njill lawrence is the commentary editor of usa today. follow her on twitter

by eugene kiely and d'angelo gore\n\nfactcheck.org\n\nat a campaign rally in nashville, president trump repeated a bushelful of false and misleading claims, and added a few new ones:\n\ntrump said the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act was so unconstitutional. the supreme court upheld the mandate. in june 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty can be considered a tax that is within the power of congress to impose.\n\nthe president also said the senate's failure to pass a bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act 'cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. congressional budget experts say it would have saved a net total of $321 billion over 10 years.\n\nthe president also repeated numerous false, misleading and exaggerated claims on wages, trade, immigration and world opinion of the u.s.\n\naffordable care act\n\nthe president held a make america great again rally in nashville on may 29. he touched on numerous topics, touting in particular passage of the tax cuts and jobs act. in addition to overhauling the nation's tax code, the new tax law will repeal the tax imposed on certain people who do not purchase a qualified health insurance plan.\n\nthe tax, known as the individual mandate, took effect in 2014 and, under the new law, will be repealed in 2019.\n\ntrump criticized the mandate as unpopular and unfair. but he then added unconstitutional, which isn't true.\n\ntrump, may 29: plus in the tax cuts what did we get? the individual mandate is out the window. that was the most unpopular part of obamacare. so unconstitutional.\n\nin fact, the supreme court ruled the individual mandate was constitutional. in a 5-4 opinion on june 28, 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty — as it was described in the affordable care act — is actually a tax collected by the irs, and it is within congressional powers to impose new taxes.\n\ntrump can have the opinion that it should have been ruled unconstitutional, but it was not.\n\nthe republicans included the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill, because they were unable to pass the better care reconciliation act of 2017, a republican bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act.\n\ntrump lamented the failure to pass the health care bill, which failed 49-51 after sen. john mccain voted against it in the early morning hours of july 28, 2017, by signaling a thumbs-down. if mccain had voted for the bill, vice president mike pence could have broken the 50-50 tie, and the bill would have passed.\n\ntrump, may 29: it was done, and then, early in the morning, somebody turned the hand in the wrong direction. that cost our country a lot. that was a very, very terrible thing that happened that night. that was a very terrible thing. that cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving that nobody would have known.\n\ntrump is not telling the whole story when he says the bill could have saved the country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. in addition to reducing health care spending, mostly on medicaid, the senate health care bill would have repealed or modified tax provisions in the aca that provide increased revenues to the federal treasury.\n\non balance, the senate bill would have reduced deficits by a net $321 billion over 10 years, 2017 to 2026, when accounting for the lost tax revenues, according to a joint analysis of the bill by the joint committee on taxation and the nonpartisan congressional budget office. (the analysis was based on the version posted to the senate budget committee website as of june 26, 2017.)\n\ncbo and jct, june 26, 2017: cbo and jct estimate that, over the 2017-2026 period, enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by $1,022 billion and reduce revenues by $701 billion, for a net reduction of $321 billion in the deficit over that period.\n\nthe biggest savings would have come from medicaid spending. cbo and jct estimated that medicaid spending would have declined in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with current law — a reduction of $772 billion over the 10-year period. as a result, about 15 million fewer people would have been enrolled in medicaid by 2026, compared with what enrollment would have been under current law, the analysis said.\n\nthe savings, however, would have been offset by the repeal and modification of certain taxes. the senate version analyzed by congressional budget experts would have, among other things, repealed a surtax on net investment income and annual fees imposed on health insurers. the repeal of the investment income surtax, for example, would have reduced revenues by $172 billion, budget analysts said.\n\nrepeating himself\n\nthe president also repeated several claims that we have already debunked — sometimes more than once.\n\nthe claim: and wages, for the first time in many, many years, are finally going up.\n\nthe facts: it is not the first time that wages are going up. the upward trend in wages started under president barack obama and has continued under trump. the average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.1 percent during trump's first 15 months, after going up 4.0 percent during obama's eight years. those figures include managers and supervisors. the real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 1.4 percent so far under trump, after rising 3.7 percent during obama's years.\n\nthe claim: i say it, and i say it all the time, we are so respected again. i can't even tell you — really, the degree to which people respect our country again. it's amazing. it's amazing.\n\nthe facts: as we wrote, the pew global attitudes project last year found that citizens in 35 out of 37 countries have less confidence in trump than they did in obama — significantly so, in some cases. the decline in confidence in the u.s. president has been especially pronounced among some of america's closest allies in europe and asia, as well as neighboring mexico and canada, pew found. a more recent gallup world poll survey, released in january, found similar results. median approval of u.s. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%, gallup found.\n\nthe claim: so they go and they take this man, right? and he got here and he's got 22 people that came in — his mother, his father, his grandmother, his uncle, his brother, his sister. he got — 22 people come in for this one guy. that's called chain migration — 22 people.\n\nthe facts: trump is talking about sayfullo habibullaevic saipov, an uzbekistan-born immigrant charged with killing eight people in new york city on oct. 31. but, as we have written, there is no evidence that saipov brought 22 people with him to the united states. in fact, as a green card holder, saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married and had children in the united states — so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by trump.\n\nthe claim: think of it, a lottery. you pick people. now, let me ask you. so these countries that are sending people in — do you think they are sending us their finest?\n\nthe facts: trump is again distorting the diversity immigrant visa program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the united states. countries aren't sending us anybody. individuals submit applications, and those eligible must meet certain requirements and pass a security background check. stephen w. yale-loehr, who teaches immigration law at cornell law school, told us: among other things, the consular officer must make sure the individual is not 'inadmissible.' this means that the person has not committed a crime, doesn't have a serious health problem, isn't a terrorist, hasn't committed fraud, and hasn't overstayed in the u.s. before.\n\nthe claim: we lose with mexico over $100 billion a year with this crazy nafta deal.\n\nthe facts: census bureau data show that the u.s. trade deficit in goods and services with mexico was $69 billion in 2017, up from $63 billion in 2016 and $58 billion in 2015.\n\nthe claim: we passed the largest tax cuts and reform in american history. larger than ronald reagan, many years ago.\n\nthe facts: the tax bill that trump signed into law in december is not the largest tax cut in history. it is estimated to reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation. it needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under president reagan, which was 2.9 percent of gdp, according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget.\n\nthe claim: so, instead of spending $1 billion and not having it for 20 years, we spent four-hundred-thousand bucks and it opened up in a few months. is that good? is that a good story?\n\nthe facts: in discussing moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, trump conflates the alleged estimated cost ($1 billion) of building a new u.s. embassy in jerusalem with the actual cost (less than $400,000) of renovating existing space for the interim embassy that opened in may. the interim embassy will be temporary; the state department still intends to build a permanent facility.
erica payne\n\nopinion contributor\n\nlast month's upset primary victory by alexandria ocasio-cortez, who beat 10-term incumbent joe crowley in a new york city district, was decisive proof: the democrats' path to victory requires exciting their base with a bold, fearless agenda that includes medicare for all.\n\nwe have seen this strategy prove successful not just for ocasio-cortez, but also for ben jealous, who won a competitive primary for maryland governor, and candidates like kara eastman, who won her primary against a former congressman in nebraska.\n\nthe merits of medicare for all have been touted by medical professionals, business leaders and health care economists for a variety of reasons: it would help drive down costs, eliminate administrative waste, increase transparency, bring down rising drug costs, and ease the costly burden of health insurance from businesses and individuals.\n\nand, beyond the benefits of the policy, it's a winning political strategy.\n\nit's not enough to fix aca\n\ndespite democrats' attempts to salvage the affordable care act — a crucial law for millions of americans — sabotage by the trump administration and republicans has proved highly effective. they've cut advertising budgets aimed at getting more young people into the insurance pool, repealed the individual mandate which helped balance out healthy and sick people, announced they won't defend protections against price gouging for people with pre-existing conditions, and just froze billions of dollars in payments meant to help insurers cover sicker policyholders.\n\nas a result, the uninsured rate rose last year for the first time since the bill was enacted in 2010 — 12.2% of americans are now uninsured. while the aca has managed to slow the rate of premium increases, they are still rising faster than wages and the inflation rate.\n\nmore:health care will define the midterms. donald trump's move to gut obamacare guarantees it.\n\ni still want to work with republicans to fix health care and lower costs: patty murray\n\nmental health crisis isn't about guns. it's about trump & gop gutting medicaid: kennedy\n\nto win, democrats need to do more than just point fingers at republicans and claim they're destroying the aca. candidates need to take it one step further: make medicare for all a central part of their platform.\n\nthis message draws a clear line in the sand: republicans want to strip you of your health insurance, while democrats want to offer low-cost, universal coverage. it's an endorsement of universal health care that doesn't waffle, and isn't complicated.\n\nunlike the affordable care act, medicare for all is not difficult to understand, and sells itself on its merits. it appeals to patients drowning in medical debt, doctors and medical professionals buried in paperwork, workers who are shouldering more of their premium costs, and business owners who year after year are forced to devote more resources to keeping their employees insured.\n\nit excites a group that democrats desperately need to get to the polls — younger voters, who strongly support it.. and it shows that a candidate is willing to take on special interests on behalf of their constituents.\n\nmedicare for all is a better insurance system\n\nvoters want to hear a positive message around health care: recent polling data revealed that preserving health care is the top voting issue for americans. democrats can be the party offering a bold and viable solution.\n\nthey need to tell voters how they're going to make things better, how they're going to defend health care as a basic right, and how they're going to create a new system that better serves the needs of patients, workers, small and mid-sized businesses, and the economy. they need to really differentiate themselves from the republicans and show that they speak for people first, not the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nmedicare for all is more than just the right thing to do, and it's more than just good policy. it's good politics.\n\nerica payne, the founder and president of the patriotic millionaires and the agenda project, serves on the board of advisers to the business initiative for health policy. follow her on twitter: @ericapayneap
trump: biden against 'oil, guns and god' campaigning in pittsburgh, pa., president donald trump portrayed democratic nominee joe biden as an opponent of oil, guns and god, and said the election is a matter of economic survival for pennsylvania. ap\n\npresident donald trump says he's not a politician. as proof, the real estate developer points to the promises he made both on the 2016 campaign and early in his term – and, he says, delivered.\n\nunlike so many who came before me, i keep my promises, trump said during his state of the union speech this year.\n\nso what were his major promises?\n\nthe appointment of conservative justices to federal courts. broad tax cuts. building a border wall on the southern border and making mexico pay for it. massive deregulation. replacing obamacare with a health coverage plan that's far less expensive and far better. bringing back manufacturing. reinvigorating fading industries, such as coal and steel. renegotiating trade deals in a way that helps the u.s. moving the israeli embassy to jerusalem. curbing immigration. reducing the national debt. withdrawing from the paris climate accord.\n\nbuild the wall? travel ban? tax cuts?: after trump's state of the union, here's where he stands on promises\n\nmichigan represented one of president donald trump's closest victories in 2016. and one of his most important. the great lakes state again is expected to be a key battleground this time around (sept. 18) ap\n\nthe usa today network looked at a number of the promises – large and small, national and exceedingly local – that trump made on the campaign trail four years ago and early in his term, to measure his success.\n\ntrump has delivered on a number of them, including tax cuts, conservative judges, de-regulation, the climate accord and the israeli embassy to name a few. some have been partly accomplished, such as trade deals, the border wall and defeating isis. other pledges have yet to be realized, such as bringing back coal and steel and replacing the affordable care act. and some have gone in the wrong direction, such as reducing the national debt and bringing back manufacturing.\n\nlarry sabato, director of center for politics at the university of virginia, said the president has certainly fulfilled some promises, especially the appointment of conservative judges that have won him the continued admiration of white evangelicals who are expected to again support him in overwhelming numbers.\n\nbut the president also tends to exaggerate his record of delivering, sabato said.\n\nif you listen to trump, he's fulfilled all promises and has done so perfectly, he wrote in an email to usa today. in other words, he can't be relied on to tell the truth and only people who haven't paid attention over the past four years or are members of his worshipful base would believe otherwise.\n\nbut, how's that border wall paid for by mexico coming? he asked, a reference to one campaign pledge trump has not yet made good on.
jason sattler\n\nopinion columnist\n\nthe so-called rust belt made donald trump president of the united states, and now it could help take away his immunity by house majority.\n\nrepublican troy balderson may have snuck by democrat danny o'connor with a fully operational gop turnout machine behind him to win the special election in ohio's 12th congressional district. but the two candidates were separated by less than 1 percentage point wednesday with more than 8,000 absentee and provisional ballots left to count, in a district that republican rep. pat tiberi won by nearly 37 points in 2016. that should be no comfort to the gop.\n\nyou can't expect a newbie to perform like an incumbent, but both mitt romney and donald trump carried the district by 11 percentage points. there are 68 gop-held u.s. house districts with a more democratic lean than ohio's 12th. democrats only need to pick up 23 of them to grab the majority and subpoena power over the trump administration.\n\ncrumbling midwest numbers for trump, gop\n\nthe gop still has what could be insurmountable advantages heading into november. but what's going on in the rust belt in general should have republicans praying for intervention from their higher power, vladimir putin.\n\ntrump's numbers in the key midwest states that he pulled from democrats are plummeting and, as he claws for his political life, he seems to be dragging down his party with him. republicans are trailing in polls for the governorships they've held since 2011 in wisconsin, michigan and ohio.\n\na recent nbc news/marist poll found that 63 percent of wisconsin voters and 62 percent in michigan say trump doesn't deserve another term. his approval rating is below his national average at 36 percent in both states. in two june polls of ohio, voters disapproved of trump by double-digit margins.\n\nmore:republican congress won't rein in donald trump\n\ntrump has built a pyramid scheme of public fraud. it's a taxpayer-backed cash grab.\n\npennsylvania lesson for dems: get angry at trump & gop, not your own candidates\n\nmuch has been made of trump's continued popularity with white voters, in particular white voters without a college education. and while trump is still 3 percentage points above water in michigan with the white group he once called the poorly educated, he's 6 points below with the same group in wisconsin.\n\nbut people who look at only race will miss the larger story of what's going on with trump's crumbling numbers in the midwest. income tells a much clearer story. in wisconsin, trump is at 41 percent approval among voters earning at least $50,000 a year and only 28 percent with those earning less than that.in michigan, 32 percent of those earning under $50,000 approve of trump, compared with 37 percent earning at least $50,000 a year.\n\npolitical scientist josh pacewicz argued that trump's popularity in the rust belt was the result of undirected populist resentment at a technocratic, corporate-friendly elite. the corporate-friendly elite might as well be the name of the trump administration's softball team, if they had ever heard of softball.\n\ntrump's policies have been precisely tailored to pleasure the richest. under his tax law, businesses received nine times more in cuts than what they gave their workers and spent 37 times more on stock buybacks than on bonuses since the reforms became law, according to an april analysis by americans for tax fairness. now, trump's treasury secretary has suggested that the administration may serve up $100 billion more in tax cuts that will go just to the richest of the richest, who just happen to include much of trump's cabinet, family and big donors.\n\npredatory lenders and corporate criminals are getting lush new protections while the great lakes are under attack. and if there is an economic boom going on, it's flowing mostly to the sort of americans who can pay a $200,000 initiation fee at mar-a-lago — and-or democrats.\n\nan associated press analysis finds that 58.5 percent of the job gains from may of 2017 until this may were in counties that backed 2016 popular vote-winner hillary clinton. these are mostly the areas of the country that were doing pretty well under president barack obama.\n\ntrump is a plutocrat, not a populist\n\nif you were a voter who was only willing to tolerate trump's race baiting in order to get some actual relief for your community or to punish the elites, then putting kids in cages, cracking down on legal immigrants and deporting veterans' wives is a poor substitute.\n\ntrump's problem is that voters in the rust belt know what actual populism looks like.\n\na quinnipiac university poll found that sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio, has a healthy 55 percent approval rating and is leading his republican opponent by 17 percentage points. brown has supported trump's efforts to reshape trade (some of which look a lot like what the obama administration negotiated). but he opposes pretty much everything else trump has done — from tax cuts for the rich to continued attempts to repeal obamacare and make massive cuts to medicaid, a quest that will definitely resume in 2019 should the gop keep the house.\n\nin exchange for their votes for gold-plated populism, midwesterners got a plutocrat in need of platinum pacifier. if trump is going to fool them again, he'll need a new act — or an old one with a super strong dose of what he knows best: scaring white people.\n\njason sattler, a member of usa today's

aetna pulls plans from 'obamacare'\n\nthe 3rd largest health insurance company in the us is pulling its plans from 70% of the obamacare insurance exchanges it participates in.
now that democrats will control the u.s. senate, president-elect joe biden is poised to implement an agenda that could affect the personal finances of millions of americans, from how much they pay in income taxes to whether they can pare college debt – or afford college at all.\n\nthose who stand to benefit most are the middle class and low-wage earners, experts say, while the affluent will likely pay more.\n\nbiden ramps up government spending on education, health care and other social programs, the benefits of which largely go to those in the bottom half of the income distribution,'' moody's analytics wrote in a report for investors before biden was officially the president-elect. meanwhile, he meaningfully increases taxes on the well-to-do, financial institutions and businesses to help pay for it.\n\nback to the office? no way:nearly 30% of working professionals would quit if they had to return to office after pandemic\n\nwhich stores are shutting for good:is your bed bath & beyond closing? see the list of stores slated to close by the end of february 2021\n\nsince the georgia senate wins gave democrats just the narrowest of majorities, analysts say biden could push through parts, but not all, of these proposals, over the next four years:\n\ntaxes\n\nbiden has repeatedly said americans earning less than $400,000 a year won't pay a cent more in taxes. but those earning above that threshold could lose their tax cuts and pay a bit more.\n\nbiden has recommended raising the marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for the nation's highest pool of earners, according to the tax foundation and the committee for a responsible federal budget.\n\namericans with more than $1 million in total income would see income brought in from dividends, as well as capital gains, taxed like their wages, and taxpayers could see the itemized deductions they declare pared, moody's says.\n\nwhere's my stimulus check? did the irs send your second stimulus check to the wrong bank account?\n\ncovid-19 home testing:amazon now sells at-home covid-19 testing kits as cases continue to rise in the us\n\nmeanwhile, biden campaign spokesman michael gwin has told reuters that biden will effectively lower taxes for the middle class by giving them refundable credits that reduce what they pay for health care coverage and help them purchase their first home and pay for child care.\n\nmost immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many americans struggling to pay their bills, biden says he will expand the child tax credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for the youngest children. that would mean, according to his website, that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle-schooler would receive $6,600.\n\nstock winners and losers:what stocks could be the biggest winners and losers under a biden presidency\n\nhealth care\n\nthe u.s. supreme court is expected to rule in the middle of this year on whether the affordable care act is constitutional.\n\nthe law will likely be upheld, based on a november hearing in which two members of the court's conservative majority, including chief justice john roberts, said the law could survive even if its mandate to purchase insurance must be struck down.\n\nstill, with the health coverage of more than 20 million people hanging in the balance, along with protections for millions more who have preexisting conditions, biden has said he has a plan for not only salvaging the law but making it stronger.\n\nwhat i'm going to do is pass obamacare with a public option,'' biden said in the final presidential debate with donald trump. it becomes bidencare.\n\nhe says americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting americans who couldn't access medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the aca.\n\nbiden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through aca marketplaces. he says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.\n\nand americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a biden administration says it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.\n\nmuch of biden's plan requires legislation, which has a better chance of being approved with democrats controlling both chambers of congress.\n\nhousing\n\na sizable chunk of a family's budget goes toward covering the cost of housing.\n\nnearly half of americans who rent pay more than 30% of their income on those monthly payments, according to the center for american progress, limiting how much they have left to spend on necessities like groceries or education.\n\nbiden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low-wage earners.\n\nbiden has talked about making sure americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the section 8 program for those who qualify.\n\nbiden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly african americans, to buy or hold on to property – from onerous interest rates that leave them vulnerable to falling behind on payments, ending up in foreclosure, to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by black people.\n\nbias in lending, as well as predatory financing that focused on black americans in the years before the 2008 recession, have been key reasons for the wide wealth gap between blacks and whites, experts say, leaving african americans at a disadvantage when it comes to passing down resources to future generations or funding the launch of a business.\n\nbiden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. he will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the office of fair lending and equal opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.\n\nchild care, free early education\n\nbiden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families.\n\nhe will offer tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care. parents earning less than $125,000 a can get back up to half what they spend on child care for children under 13. the cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. and families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.\n\nfor children under 5, biden supports the child care for working families act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.\n\nadditionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. that amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to biden's campaign site.\n\nbiden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\ncollege costs\n\nbiden wants to make community college and comparable training programs free. and students from households earning less than $125,000 a year will not have to pay tuition if they attend four-year public colleges and universities.\n\nhe also wants to raise the value of pell grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.\n\ncollege debt\n\nbiden says he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. after deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.\n\nif they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years the balance of their loans will be forgiven.\n\nborrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.\n\nhe says he will also improve the public service loan forgiveness program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. the cap would be five years.\n\nfollow charisse

washington – the partial government shutdown is now the longest in american history.\n\nthe shutdown entered its 22nd day on saturday, surpassing the previous 21-day record set in late 1995 and early 1996 during the clinton administration.\n\nnine federal departments and several smaller agencies – one-fourth of the federal government – remain closed as the standoff barrels into its fourth week with no end in sight.\n\nmembers of the house and the senate both went home to their districts on friday and won't return until monday, guaranteeing that parts of the government will remain closed at least through early next week.\n\nhere's what to know about the situation.\n\nwhen will it end?\n\nhard to say.\n\npresident donald trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border. that would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the white house and congressional democrats over border wall funding.\n\nbut exactly when trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.\n\ntrump suggested during a trip to the border in texas on thursday that an emergency declaration could come at any time if negotiations with democrats fail to yield a deal on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding.\n\nbut trump played down the prospects of an imminent emergency declaration on friday, saying he wasn't going to do it so fast.\n\na sign that he's serious about declaring an emergency: the pentagon is already preparing options to build barriers along the southern border if trump does declare a national emergency there. an emergency declaration would allow the army corps of engineers to design barriers and allow contracts to build them.\n\nan emergency declaration by trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. but it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.\n\nmore:donald trump makes several misstatements during tour of u.s.-mexico border in texas\n\nwhat has been the impact?\n\nthe shutdown has rippled across the country since it started dec. 22.\n\non friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. the employees have been forced to take unpaid leave or work without pay, leaving many wondering how they will pay their mortgage or rent, make car payments and make ends meet. some businesses have resorted to offering furlough freebies, such as free meals and restaurant discounts, to tide the displaced workers over until their next check.\n\ntourists in the nation's capital have been forced to come up with alternative itineraries as a result of the shutdown. popular tourist attractions like the national zoo, the smithsonian museums and national monuments are all closed.\n\nnational parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. the national park service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. but many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.\n\nvandalism also has been a problem. at joshua tree national park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern california park by cutting down several joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.\n\nair travel has been hampered by the shutdown. aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. miami international airport is closing one of its terminals saturday through monday because many transportation security administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.\n\nthe shutdown is even causing reverberations in space. repairs to the main camera on the hubble space telescope have been delayed because of agency closures.\n\nmore:government shutdown: how it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer\n\nhow have other shutdowns ended?\n\nbefore the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. the lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between president bill clinton and house speaker newt gingrich. it ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nin 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when democratic president jimmy carter found himself at odds with congress even though democrats controlled both the house and senate. carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. funding for the department of health, education and welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nthat shutdown finally ended when carter managed to get the projects he opposed stripped from the legislation, and the house and senate passed a bill that expanded the exceptions to the medicaid abortion ban to include rape and incest.\n\na 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. unable to repeal president barack obama's signature health care law, republicans in congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement obamacare. the senate, controlled by democrats, rejected the plan. the standoff ended when republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.\n\ncontributing: usa today reporters tom vanden brook, ledyard king, bill theobald, kelly tyko and ben

jayne o'donnell and tony leys\n\nusa today network\n\nmany of next year's premium rate increases on the affordable care act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect, interviews with insurance regulators and records show.\n\nwith dramatic drops in insurance company participation on the exchanges for some states, decreased competition and other factors are leading to often jarring rate hikes. some of the states that are facing what are likely among the biggest increases this year — tennessee, arizona and north carolina — were among those the urban institute reported in may had the biggest increases last year.\n\nthe reality is, it's all very justified, unfortunately, iowa insurance commissioner nick gerhart said thursday of the premium increases he approved this week of 19% to 43% for about 70,000 iowans who buy their own policies.\n\ngerhart warned consumers in a rate hearing in july that if he rejected insurers' proposed premium increases for 2017, the carriers would likely decline to sell policies in the state. no carriers made an explicit threat to leave iowa, but the implication was clear, he says: it gives you less room to maneuver. iowa law, he said, requires him to judge proposed premium increases on whether experts find them to be justified by carriers' projected costs\n\nas other state insurance commissioners gradually sign off on insurers' rate requests — which should all be decided within a month — many consumers are learning what's in store for 2017.\n\nissues with the exchanges consumed a disproportionate amount of attention at the national association of insurance commissioners' summer meeting, which ended monday, said john huff, the group's president.\n\nthe individual health insurance market is typically one of the smallest parts of commissioners' focus even with health insurance and they also have to deal with far more sweeping issues including property and casualty insurance and medical liability.\n\nclearly, state and federal policymakers need to continue to work together (toward) a more stable risk pool, certainty on funding and more reasonable regulations, says huff, who is also director of missouri's insurance office. over six years after the law was passed, making substantive corrections to the law is past due and, consequently, the markets are suffering.\n\ninsurers need enough healthy people in the pool of consumers enrolled in their plans to offset the financial risks in covering the sick ones who need costly care. a shortage of healthy consumers on the exchanges to date is often attributed to the high premiums and relatively low tax penalties so far for remaining uninsured.\n\nhealth and human service department secretary sylvia burwell said thursday the insurance exchanges can be made sustainable in the long term though administrative actions by the agency, but legislative action could speeds things up.\n\ninsurance premiums are probably still lower than they would have been if the congressional budget office's early high projections played out, burwell said. she added that it's important to consider the affordable care act's overall effect on americans, including those who have employer-provided coverage rather than just the 11 million people enrolled in insurance through the exchanges.\n\nlegislators spar over obamacare rate hike\n\nbut while that's some solace for people including breast cancer survivor christine frietchen of new york city, she just got a letter from empire blue cross blue shield saying she faces a 22% rate increase for 2017. that will bring her premium to more than $630 a month for a silver-level plan that only covers in-network care and requires referrals for everything.\n\nno doubt, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays will also increase as they say there will be 'changes' in the letter, but they don't specify what those will be, says frietchen, who works for a nutritionist and author. i'm certain the rate hike is the tip of the iceberg.\n\nmany argue that premium costs — even when heavily subsidized by the government — are too high. the health law considers it affordable if insurance premiums cost 6% or less of income for those earning under 200% of the federal poverty limit, or about $40,000 for a family of three,\n\nthat's really, really asking a lot, says john holahan, a fellow at the urban institute's health policy center. the way it was designed, it was almost destined to not work..\n\nholahan, co-author of the recent urban institute report, found the number of insurers, the level of 2015 premiums, and the types of insurers participating within the markets were the major factors influencing whether there were premium increases or decreases. the report concluded there is no meaningful national average, and the wide variation state to state is tied directly varying levels of competition around the country.\n\nin tennessee, the insurance commissioner signed off on average rate increases of 59%, but holahan says it's important to consider the proportion of population affected by rate increases. urban areas often have strong competition and lower rates.\n\nin middle tennessee, where lori woodard-hoyt does health care consulting that includes insurance assistance to doctors, she says many consumers are choosing to remain uninsured — especially considering the challenges many face finding in-network specialists in their rural areas. with high-deductible plans, others also can't afford to pay what they owe when go to the doctor.\n\nin delaware, gavin braithwaite and his wife lou are facing a proposed 32.5% increase in their highmark blue cross blue shield plan for 2017, which is especially painful as it comes on top of a more than 55% increase in 2016 and a nearly 24% hike in 2015.\n\nalready our retirement savings are being severely impacted, gavin wrote to his state senators and other officials this week. where will this trend leave us in 2018 and beyond?\n\nbraithwaite says he wants to stay with the plan, which covers just his wife as he's on medicare, because it's a lot of aggravation to change plans and possibly doctors and they have been with highmark for nearly 10 years.\n\ngina brodie of tucson bought an individual policy for about a decade before the aca and says she's fed up with increasing premiums. brodie and her husband have been paying more than $900 a month for an gold-level plan they bought on healthcare.gov even though she gave up trying to find a primary care doctor who would accept her insurance over the summer.\n\nwith all but two insurers expected to leave her county for 2017 and the state insurance commissioner questioning how much leverage he has given the departures, brodie and others in her state are wondering how they will afford insurance and what it will be worth next year.\n\nit is quite infuriating to read about how all the insurance companies are losing money, when we rarely, if ever, have utilized our many insurance plans over the years, says brodie, who has a form of chronic arthritis that she would like treated. those insurance companies have made nearly 100% profit on us, while we got either zero benefits or zero access to the system.\n\nfrietchen, who is single and 46, says she'd likely be paying far more for private health insurance coverage, or i would not have been able to take a job with a startup that i really love, but that's too small to offer a health care benefit.\n\nwe're dealing with obamacare version 1.0 here, says frietchen. i never expected it would be perfect right out of the gate, and i hope that our next president focuses on refinement, revision and review, rather than repeal.\n\nhuff says the next few months will determine much about the reputations and priorities of insurers. those who want policies that take effect january 1 need to sign up by dec. 15.\n\nconsumers may not realize until december 15 that there's no one here in the market and may ask the question: 'where were the insurers when consumers needed them?' says huff. that's a potential reputational risk for health insurers.
usa today\n\npresident trump will participate in a roundtable discussion on tax reform in white sulphur springs, wv\n\nbig unions are challenging american companies to show them the tax-cut money.\n\nbefore the sweeping tax cuts were passed late last year, major u.s. corporations joined president trump and republicans in congress in vowing the reform would grow the economy, create jobs and raise wages. and since then, many have boosted minimum wages, doled out bonuses and increased spending and charitable giving.\n\nbut the unions want companies to go a step further. as part of ongoing contract negotiations or talks set to begin within months, unions including the communications workers of america, service employees international union, the teamsters and the american federation of teachers are asking companies such as at&t and american airlines to reveal how much the tax overhaul will fatten their profits and what they plan to do with the windfall. they're demanding that the companies specify the portion of the gains that will be used to boost wages, bring back jobs from overseas and make capital investments as well as the amount going toward increasing executive pay and buying back stock.\n\nmore: corporate america's tax-cut generosity: is it real?\n\nmore: did your company pay you a bonus with tax savings? check the list.\n\nmore: tax cut, bonuses for workers? many small businesses not sure yet\n\nusa today will live stream coverage of this event in the player above.
william cummings and ken alltucker\n\nusa today\n\nthe trump administration declared that it no longer will defend the affordable care act from a challenge filed by 20 states because it agrees that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional and that key parts of the act — including the provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions — are invalid.\n\npresident trump has long declared the aca, also known as obamacare, to be a disaster, and the brief filed thursday night is the latest attempt by his administration to weaken former president barack obama's signature health-care law.\n\nbut the move also upends a longstanding legal and democratic norm that the executive branch will uphold existing laws.\n\ni am at a loss for words to explain how big of a deal this is, university of michigan law professor nicholas bagley said in a blog post.\n\nbagley, a former justice department attorney, said the doj has a durable, longstanding, bipartisan commitment to defending the laws passed by congress as long as there is a legitimate non-frivolous argument to be made in its defense.\n\nthe justice department has an obligation to defend the law, and it has refused to do so because it dislikes this particular law, bagley told usa today. the administration decided its dislike for the affordable care act outweighed its respect for the rule of law.\n\nbagley said the brief reveals the depth of institutional decay at the department of justice, and he expressed profound concern about the precedent it sets. it suggests that future administrations can pick and choose which laws they're going to enforce, he said.\n\nin a three-page letter to house minority leader nancy pelosi, d-calif., attorney general jeff sessions acknowledged the executive branch has a longstanding tradition of defending the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes if reasonable arguments can be made in their defense. but sessions said this was a rare case and not unprecedented.\n\nfor example, the obama administration decided not to defend the defense of marriage act in 2011.\n\nthe trump administration argues that because the new tax law eliminates the penalty for not buying insurance, the supreme court's previous ruling permitting the mandate as a tax no longer applies.\n\nthe justice department does not join the 20 states in the lawsuit in saying that this invalidates the entire law. rather, in the brief, the justice department says that only the section of the law dealing with the individual mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nhowever, the trump administration believes the provision of the aca guaranteeing affordable rates to those with pre-existing conditions must be thrown out with the individual mandate.\n\notherwise individuals could wait until they become sick to purchase insurance, thus driving up premiums for everyone else, sessions said in his letter to pelosi.\n\npelosi and other supporters of the aca were quick to condemn the move.\n\ntonight, the trump administration took its cynical sabotage campaign of americans' health care to a stunning new low, pelosi said in a statement. once again, republicans are trying to destroy protections for americans with pre-existing conditions. the trump administration is perpetuating the same cruel vision of higher costs and less coverage that house republicans voted for in the monstrosity of trumpcare.\n\nthe trump administration once again is allowing premiums to go up and middle class americans to pay more, senate minority leader chuck schumer said in a tweet. the aca is the law of the land and doj should defend it.\n\nin refusing to follow bipartisan tradition and defend the aca in the u.s. federal court system, the trump administration is nakedly admitting that it wants to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, breaking a promise that the president has made time and again, said topher spiro, vice president of health policy at the center for american progress.\n\nif the court agrees with the justice department's argument to toss out part of the law that protects individuals with an existing medical condition, that could affect millions of americans who buy insurance directly from the marketplace.\n\nmore than one in four adults under the age of 65 have existing medical conditions, according to kaiser family foundation.\n\nbefore the affordable care act marketplace launched in 2014, people with chronic diseases who tried to buy their own insurance were routinely denied coverage based on their medical history.\n\nbagley said that the trump administration's move does not signal the end of obamacare, although it does further cloud its future. states such as california will take up the law's defense, and the legal battle will continue.\n\nwhile the case still must play out before the nation's high court, the justice department's decision to not defend the law could create some uncertainty for health insurers that sell plans on the affordable care act marketplace, according to larry levitt, a kaiser family foundation senior vice president who closely monitors the health law.\n\nwhen insurance companies face uncertainty, they increase premiums, levitt tweeted thursday night.\n\nafter the latest attempt to repeal the health law failed with arizona sen. john mccain's dramatic thumbs down vote last july, the trump administration has taken other steps that obamacare advocates say weaken the law.\n\nthe administration last fall ended a key payment to insurers that helped lower the cost of insurance for low-income americans who purchased marketplace insurance.\n\nmore recently, the administration also sought to loosen rules on short-term health insurance plans that are less expensive but don't carry the same consumer protections as obamacare plans. experts believe that could entice healthier people to exit the marketplace in favor of less-expensive, short-term plans, leaving the marketplace with a sicker population that could drive insurance costs higher.\n\nthe washington post reported that three career justice attorneys involved in the case — joel mcelvain, eric beckenhauer and rebecca kopplin — withdrew before the filing at 6 p.m. thursday, an unusual time for such an action.\n\nbagley said, that's almost unheard of. these are lawyers who have made arguments they personally disagreed with countless times. they're civil servants. they're good soldiers. yet they could not sign it. that's how far out the administration's position is.
kirsten powers\n\nopinion columnist\n\nfetal heartbeat laws are all the rage right now.\n\ngeorgia, kentucky, ohio and mississippi have passed bans on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. similar bills are working their way through the legislatures of south carolina, louisiana and alabama.\n\nof the bills passed, only georgia allows an exception for rape and incest; in alabama the sponsor of a bill that would ban nearly all abortions threatened to kill the legislation if rape or incest exceptions were added.\n\nthese laws effectively outlaw abortion at six weeks, just two weeks after a missed period, a point at which many women don't even realize they are pregnant. the likelihood that a preteen or teenage girl would know she is pregnant in time to beat this cutoff is almost nonexistent. indeed, the only reason an 11-year-old ohio girl recently impregnated by a rapist wouldn't be forced to give birth is because the law ins't in effect yet and its implementation will likely be delayed by legal challenges.\n\nread more commentary:\n\ni had a later abortion because i couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace\n\nabortion restrictions can harm women. let's follow evidence, not ideology, in 2019.\n\npro-life movement should follow abby johnson's lead, turning abortion workers into allies\n\nabortion-rights opponents believe this is just moral consistency. if an embryo or fetus is a person, then ending that life is murder. nobody should be murdered, ergo an 11-year-old who has been raped should be forced to carry her pregnancy to term.\n\nsee, a not so funny thing happens when you blindly follow ideology — or in this case, theology — to its natural end point. you become an extremist. if your principles inextricably lead you to the conclusion that, for example, a teenager impregnated by her father should be forced to give birth to that child, it's time to go back to the drawing board.\n\ni long valued intellectual consistency above all. it was a theoretically laudable trait until it gave way to a myopic moral certainty that created troubling blind spots. this damaging predilection long predated my conversion to christianity, which turned a tiny spark of certitude into a raging inferno of unyielding self-righteousness.\n\n'i wanted to be a real christian'\n\na little backstory: more than a decade ago, i came to faith while attending an evangelical church in new york city with my then-boyfriend. after this, i followed a winding path of spiritual searching during which time i steeped myself in evangelical theology. in the end, i returned to the catholic church, the faith of my beloved grandparents. throughout this period, i was surrounded by people who believe that one could not be a real christian if they weren't pro-life.\n\ni wanted to be a real christian.\n\nthough i didn't see much in what i read in the bible to justify this litmus test, i was new to the faith and trusted those who seemed more theologically knowledgeable. while i came to describe myself as pro-life, i felt frustrated by how disinterested the people around me were in actually helping women reduce abortions. i believed, as i do now, that to reduce abortions, overturning roe v. wade was not the answer. what was needed was providing women the resources they need, which at a minimum involves universal health care, something most abortion critics oppose because of their fealty to republican ideology. the costs of maternal care and a pregnancy alone could bankrupt a woman with no health insurance.\n\nanti-abortion pregnancy centers, which exist to talk women out of having an abortion, know this well. the first thing they do for a pregnant woman considering abortion is get her on medicaid if she is eligible, so that her pregnancy health care will be covered. yet these same people invariably support republican politicians who are working to dismantle obamacare and oppose medicaid expansion, government funding for child care and anti-poverty programs.\n\ni regret my black-and-white approach\n\nthe focus of the real christians around me was not on giving women the support they needed to prevent pregnancy through access to contraception or on developing economic support for poor women who can't afford another child in an already struggling family. i could not make common cause with them. until, it turned out, when it came to so-called late-term abortion, generally understood to be abortion after 20-22 weeks.\n\ni wrote recently about the importance of admitting when you have made a mistake, and this is one area where i wish i could press delete on some of my past columns. i was particularly vicious toward planned parenthood, despite my long support for the work they do to increase health care access for women. when it came to abortion later in pregnancy, i employed my now signature black-and-white thinking on a complicated topic that required more care.\n\nin hindsight, i seemed convinced that abortion supporters didn't appreciate the gravity of later-term abortion. but the opposite is true. nobody understands this issue better than women who have actually had a late-term abortion. by listening to their stories, i've come to see that the tragedy of this procedure, sought in desperation, is well understood by the women receiving it.\n\nrecently, i followed the outrage over a new york abortion law, which conservatives claim allows abortion even as the woman is giving birth, and the gop's failed attempt to pass the born-alive abortion survivors protection act, which would add specific penalties for actions already illegal under a prior law that received bipartisan support in 2002.\n\nmore about politics than protection\n\nmany defenders of the redundant born alive act claim that if even one baby is not provided medical care after surviving an abortion, it is reason enough to beef up the law. but when it comes to far more american children being murdered by guns, many of the same people provide only thoughts and prayers, not legislation. i'm struggling to see the moral consistency here. it's hard to escape the conclusion that the sudden uptick in anti-abortion measures are more about the upcoming 2020 elections than any real interest in protecting innocent lives.\n\nas for the new york law, the entire premise underlying the anti-abortion fury that erupted following its passage is that women routinely carry pregnancies for nine months and then during delivery order the doctor to abort the baby, for, well, no reason. what woman would do this? it's theoretically possible, but is it really plausible that this is a regular occurrence?\n\nwhile abortion opponents paint the new york law as an abortion free-for-all, in fact the law allows for an abortion past 24 weeks only if a health care professional determines the life or health of the mother is at risk, or the fetus is not viable.\n\nabortion opponents frequently claim that the health exception to late-term abortion laws are just a ruse to allow women abortions whenever they want for any reason. but according to a statement this year by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, health issues that might require a woman to terminate a pregnancy late-term include premature rupture of membranes and infection, preeclampsia, placental abruption and placenta accreta. women in these circumstances may risk extensive blood loss, stroke and septic shock.\n\ndoctors, not the government, should be helping women decide what to do in these situations.\n\ni care about all lives, including women\n\nam i still a pro-life christian? my faith is as strong as ever, but today i'd say i'm like many americans who see themselves both as pro-choice and pro-life. personally, i don't think i would have ever have had an abortion if i faced an unwanted pregnancy. but i know enough women who swore they were anti-abortion all the way up to the point when they saw the plus sign on that little white stick to know it's pure hubris to say with certainty what decision i would have made.\n\nwhat i do know for sure is that i care about all lives, and that includes the lives of women contemplating abortion. the anti-abortion movement pays lip service to caring for women, but what the recent spate of laws shows us is that in the end there is only one thing they care about: the embryo or fetus. the lives of young rape or incest victims are accepted as collateral damage, and women who want to protect their health are as cast sinister actors incapable of searching their own consciences for a way forward when a wanted pregnancy goes awry.\n\nas troubling as these new moves by anti-abortion activists are, there is one upside. there is now perfect clarity on where the lines have been drawn, and the likelihood that this extremism will be embraced by the american people is close to zero.\n\nlet the debate begin.\n\nkirsten powers, a cnn news

usa today\n\nthe justice department said in a letter on monday that the trump administration now agrees with u.s. district judge reed o'connor that all of the affordable care act must be eliminated.\n\nlives are on the line\n\nby leana wen\n\nthe justice department of justice announced on monday its support of a federal district court ruling that would strike down the entire affordable care act, leaving more than 20 million people without health insurance.\n\ni've practiced medicine before and after the aca, and i have seen the profound impact it has had on the health and well-being of patients. in the emergency room before the aca, i treated a young woman who died from cardiac arrest because she couldn't afford treatment for the heart condition with which she was born.\n\ntalker:donald trump was proven right, this was a witch hunt\n\nask your friends and family to sign-up for the today's talker newsletter\n\nat planned parenthood, we treat thousands of patients who have never before been able to access cancer screenings, hiv tests, or treatment for diabetes and other chronic conditions. nearly 63 million people have gained access to preventive services such as no-cost birth control, well-woman visits, domestic violence screenings, and sexually transmitted disease and hiv screenings thanks to the aca.\n\nstriking down the aca will affect the most vulnerable, including women, children, seniors, people with low incomes and individuals with disabilities. how will pregnant women afford the necessary prenatal and maternity care, currently considered an essential benefit under the aca, if they lose coverage? at a time when the maternal mortality rate in the united states is worse than it was in the 1990s, it is unconscionable that we would further limit access to this care.\n\nthe aca guarantees health coverage for young people under 26 on their parents' insurance; now they could be disenrolled and forced to forgo health care altogether. repealing the aca means that health conditions insurers that had considered pre-existing conditions like pregnancy, hypertension, asthma and migraines will no longer be covered. americans will once again be priced out of the ability to care for their basic health needs.\n\nwe must also call out the destruction this would place on the nation's public health priorities. president donald trump has claimed dedication to addressing the opioid epidemic and ending hiv/aids transmission. but if critical health systems are dismantled and patients lose health insurance, how will people afford treatment for opioid use disorder and prevention services for hiv, not to mention prevention and care for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, chlamydia or even the flu?\n\nthis is yet another effort on behalf of the trump-pence administration to undermine access to health care in this country. gutting the aca will harm millions of families and roll back gains in public health. politicians have tried to sabotage the aca before. the american people organized, mobilized and stopped them in their tracks. we must do this again, because our patients' lives are on the line.\n\nleana wen is a physician and the president of planned parenthood. you can follow her on twitter: @drleanawen.\n\nwhat others are saying\n\nthe charlotte (north carolina) observer, editorial: that means the country will go back to a health care system similar to what we had, with no individual exchanges, with medicaid expansion threatened, and with millions of americans losing health coverage. congress might be able to save some pieces of the affordable care act, such as coverage of pre-existing conditions, but that too would be a long shot.\n\npeter suderman, reason.com: by all appearances, the trump administration is taking a political position for political purposes, ignoring the strongest legal arguments in the process. it is a selective approach to enforcing the law, in which the executive branch has simply declined to defend a statute it doesn't like that was passed under a rival administration. that decision could have significant implications for future administrations from either party, and they would not be good: administrations should not be in the business of picking and choosing which laws to enforce or defend.\n\nian millhiser, thinkprogress: as a general rule, the justice department has a duty to defend any federal statute challenged in court, regardless of whether the incumbent administration agrees with that statute. the justice department will disregard this duty in rare cases, such as when no reasonable arguments can be made in favor of a law. but, in this case, no reasonable argument can be made in favor of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's position.\n\nwhat our readers are saying\n\nyes, let's bring back denial of insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, let more people die uninsured or forced to file bankruptcy because of medical bills. let's also not let students stay on their parents' plan, make them go without health insurance, have everyone go back to jamming up emergency rooms because they couldn't afford to go to a doctor and now their problem is an emergency. yes, obamacare has been just terrible! if your current insurance isn't affordable, blame president barack obama, not the greedy insurance companies.\n\n— kelly a. jensen\n\ni can't afford obamacare, and yet i was penalized by having to pay a fine. only a fool would think that's fair. obama was ruling as a dictator.\n\n— phyllis virattanajun\n\nand replace the affordable care act with what?

jeff reeves\n\nspecial for usa today\n\nbeing your own boss as a self-employed worker has its perks, but also has its downsides. even if you're just doing a bit of part-time work from a computer at your kitchen table, you still must wear many hats – from accountant to human resources rep.\n\nand one of the most daunting or stressful roles that self-employed americans have to take on is that of tax planner.\n\nwhile few americans take joy in filing their annual returns, it's crucial to do a thorough job with your taxes if you're a self-employed individual. that's not just because it's the law, but also because there may be big deductions you're eligible for that allow you to keep more of that hard-earned money instead of paying up to uncle sam.\n\nafter all, since you're running a business you'll be on the hook for both the employer and the employee share of social security and medicare taxes. that can be a costly surprise to many just starting out as self-employed individuals or independent contractors getting 1099s instead of w-2 tax forms.\n\ntax news and advice\n\nso what tax breaks have the most potential for self-employed filers? here are five biggies:\n\nself-insurance: without the ready-made benefits package provided by larger corporations, many self-employed americans also must be self-insured. thankfully, premiums for medical insurance as well as dental and long-term care insurance are deductible from your taxes. the deduction can be very large, but also saves you by preventing the individual mandate penalty suffered by uninsured taxpayers with the affordable care act known as obamacare. while it's uncertain what will happen with the aca going forward, for tax year 2016 there is a penalty of $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income if you're uninsured, whichever amount is greater.\n\nretirement savings: self-employed individuals can save a lot more for retirement in vehicles like a solo 401(k), said michael mccauley, a certified public accountant in new jersey. that's because maximum retirement thresholds vary based on income, he said, and can reach as high as $53,000 for tax year 2016 or even $59,000 for those over age 50. that kind of savings isn't just a great way to supercharge your nest egg, but also a powerful way to defer taxes on the income earned by your business.\n\nsupplies and professional dues:\n\ncan i deduct medical expenses when i file taxes?\n\nwhether it's a $2,000 computer to design websites or a $2 pen to write down appointments, expenses on job-related materials are deductible – and collectively, they can add up in a big way. often overlooked, however, are job-associated dues that include fees for trade associations or even subscriptions to periodicals and journals that are relevant to your profession.\n\nhome-office deduction: many self-employed people work out of their homes, and it's easier than ever before to access related tax breaks thanks to a simplified home office deduction, said lisa greene-lewis, a cpa and tax expert for turbotax. the irs allows you to declare $5 per square foot of your home used for business up to 300 square feet, or a maximum of $1,500, as long as the space is used exclusively and regularly for business-related use. and if you have significant expenses including utilities, maintenance or even mortgage interest on the home itself, you can itemize your individual home office expenses for an even bigger break above that maximum.\n\ntax and legal advice: if you're intimidated by all this or just worried you're leaving something out, don't panic. the irs allows a deduction for tax-preparation expenses, as well as other professional legal and accounting services necessary for the efficient operation of your business, said greene-lewis. in fact, turbotax just launched a software service specifically for the self-employed that can find deductions you may not know about simply by browsing through transactions in your bank account. it helps discover deductions that they didn't even know were possible, said greene-lewis of turbotax, which means you not only get a tax break for buying the software but plenty of other deductions thanks to the added advice. don't overlook the benefit of accounting software or a hiring a tax professional like a cpa, particularly since these expenses are tax deductible themselves.\n\njeff reeves is executive editor of investorplace.com.
ed rollins\n\nopinion contributor\n\ncorrections & clarifications: an earlier version of this column should have disclosed that the author, ed rollins, is chairman of kelli ward's senate campaign.\n\nwith tax reform passed and signed into law, republicans are entering 2018 on an unprecedented high. leave it to sen. jeff flake to be a christmas grouch.\n\nthe retiring arizona republican recently called the massive crowds at rallies for president trump the spasms of a dying party— his latest parting shot at trump supporters. given his 18% approval rating last summer in arizona, the dead-in-the-water senator's latest salvo about republicans is lathered in irony. he continues to educate his party about electioneering while choosing retirement to avoid an embarrassing defeat in this year's republican primary. arizona state sen. kelli ward had a nearly 30-point lead over flake the month before he announced his departure.\n\nmore:it's now or never for paul ryan and his quest to remake america's safety net\n\nmore:how trump can help republicans in 2018 (if critics let his team do its job)\n\nwhile flake prepares for political oblivion, ward is the newest face of the trump revolution — a movement not unlike the reagan revolution that i witnessed firsthand.\n\ni served in ronald reagan's white house and managed his reelection campaign in 1984. then, like now, the occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue was more than a transformative political figure — he was the face of a national revolution. president reagan won more than 54 million votes in 1984, carrying 49 out of 50 states. americans overwhelmingly trusted him to roll back government bureaucracy, unleash economic prosperity and pursue peace through military strength.\n\nmore than three decades later, trump ran and won on similar promises. he too vowed to hold washington accountable, jumpstart sluggish economic growth, and rebuild america's military to protect our nation's interests first and foremost. his message resonated in corners of the country where the liberal media and political punditry thought it impossible.\n\nand he is succeeding. it is no coincidence that trump recently overhauled our outdated tax code for the first time since the reagan years, rewarding job creators and employees alike with pro-growth tax cuts.\n\namericans are fed up with the status quo. according to the cooperative congressional election survey, nearly two-thirds of 2016 voters indicated government corruption was an issue of very high importance to them. these voters supported trump by roughly 30 percentage points over hillary clinton, proving that the american public wants political figures to stand for their principles and drain the washington swamp.\n\nthe washington establishment should take it as a warning, and take conservative outsiders seriously. those running for the senate this year include state senator eric brakey of maine and marine corps veteran kevin nicholson in wisconsin, as well as arizona's ward, perhaps the most prominent of the upstart challengers so far.\n\nas a family physician, ward is a qualified spokeswoman against obamacare's rising premiums and limited options, and one who can continue rolling back burdensome health care mandates when elected. she is also uniquely qualified to care for her constituents the way she cared for the sick through her private practice and emergency room work.\n\nmore:2018: what could possibly go right? five possibilities.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nfor years, arizonans expected flake to act on his campaign promises. they expected him to help secure the border, repeal obamacare in full and replace it with a free-market alternative, and hold the washington swamp accountable to americans outside the beltway. but establishment republicans such as flake have failed dreadfully. instead of supporting trump's america first agenda, which won trump arizona and nearly 63 million votes nationwide in 2016, flake and other never trumpers made it their agenda to undermine the president at every turn and curry favor from the failing anti-trump crowd.\n\nunlike flake, ward is unequivocal in her support for a wall along america's southern border, rightly claiming that national security begins with border security. she has proposed a border security bill that includes funding and starting of trump's border wall, which would include 24/7 high tech monitoring accessible by the public online.\n\nward's agenda is to help make america great again, not score never trump brownie points. much like sens. rand paul, mike lee and ted cruz, we will see her go to washington to change it and fight for the america first agenda.\n\nis it any wonder that americans are turning to candidates like ward after years of disappointment? she is a true representative of the trump revolution that americans voted into power. after years of broken promises from used-car salesmen posing as politicians, the trump republicans will shake things up by trying a different tactic. they'll keep their word.\n\ned rollins is a former assistant to president reagan and managed his 1984 reelection campaign. he currently serves as chairman of kelli ward's senate campaign and chief strategist for the pro-trump great america pac.
san francisco – newly minted california gov. gavin newsom doubled down tuesday on his mission to resist white house policies that he says run counter to the interests of his state – and in his view, the nation.\n\nthe answer to the white house is, no more division and no more xenophobia, newsom, 51, told lawmakers during his first state of the state address in sacramento.\n\nduring his speech, newsom confirmed the news that he was ordering national guard troops off border patrol detail and redeploying most of the 360 personnel to wildfire and drug-gang duty.\n\nthe withdrawal echoes the move by new mexico gov. michelle lujan grisham, who a week ago cut roughly 90 percent of the 118 national guardsmen assigned to the border.\n\nnewsom's decision to take a similar stand is a rebuke to both president donald trump, who has warned about caravans of migrants heading to the border, and former california gov. jerry brown, who issued the order. national guard troops are paid with federal funds but are under state control.\n\nnewsom derided trump's recent state of the union speech as rife with fear-mongering about a so-called border emergency.\n\nhe added that border crossings are currently the lowest they've been since 1971, and cited studies indicating that immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens.\n\nthis border emergency is a manufactured crisis, newsom said to a standing ovation. california will not be part of this political theater.\n\nnewsom also took issue with a number of other white house positions, including an effort to kill the affordable care act, commonly referred to as obamacare.\n\ncalifornia must act where washington has failed, newsom said, adding that he aims to increase subsidies and reimbursement rates, as well as extend health care coverage for anyone up to 26 years old regardless of their immigration status.\n\nat one point, newsom thanked trump – and he meant it. the governor was alluding to trump's state of the union comments about the need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n\ni hope (trump) takes the lead of california in the process, newsom said, a reference to his executive order of a month ago proposing that the state be able to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on behalf of some 13 million medi-cal beneficiaries, as well as various state agencies that regularly buy drugs.\n\ncalifornia, home to some of the world's top tech companies, set a precedent by establishing a new state privacy act that requires companies such as google and facebook to divulge to residents how and where their data is being used.\n\nnewsom said he was now convening a team to look into the creation of a new law requiring technology giants to kick back some of their billions in earnings in the form of a data dividend for californians.\n\nthe other big topics on newsom's agenda tuesday were california's long-derided high-speed rail (newsom doesn't want a los angeles to san francisco run but supports developing such a train in the fertile central valley, whose residents deal with high levels of pollution and long commute times); education spending (the state currently ranks near the bottom nationally on spending per student); and the state's newly bankrupt utility, pacific gas & electric.\n\nof pg&e, newsom said a team of attorneys was spending the next two months developing a strategy to return the utility to fiscal health, but he urged lawmakers not to take their eyes off the state's ambitious clean energy goals.\n\namong them is the newly announced nation-leading mission of requiring rooftop solar panels for all new single-family homes and low-rise multi-family buildings starting in 2020.\n\nwe must map out a longer term energy framework, so the cost of climate change doesn't fall on those least able to afford it, newsom said.\n\ncalifornia's lack of affordable housing also promises to be a big focus for the state's 40th governor.\n\nthat issue is increasingly familiar to residents of urban centers around the country, and making a dent in the problem here would be one way for newsom to build a case for higher political office – even if candidate newsom told usa today last fall that his train stops in sacramento.\n\nat newsom's urging, the state recently sued the southern california beach haven of huntington beach, arguing that the city is not making efforts to make way for affordable housing in its community.\n\nnewsom said he was going to meet with mayors soon to discuss the problem. and while he said he was not poised to sue every city that resisted development, he was not going to preside over neglect any longer.\n\nthe governor said it was incumbent upon state and local officials to work hand in hand to solve not just affordable housing but also homelessness; the state is home to some 130,000 homeless, about a quarter of the nation's homeless population.\n\nour homeless crisis is becoming a public health crisis, newsom warned. we have seen typhus in los angeles, a medieval disease in california in 2019. i know mayors are working hard, but we have to have their backs. they cannot do it alone.\n\nfollow usa today national correspondent @marcodellacava
washington — senate democrats on tuesday confronted president trump's choice for health and human services secretary — a former top executive at eli lilly and co. — with the jump in price for lilly's pharmaceuticals under his tenure.\n\nas aides held up red-arrowed charts at alex azar's confirmation hearing, sen. ron wyden, d-ore., said the price of drugs used to treat diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder more than doubled when azar was president of lilly's u.s.-based subsidiary.\n\ndid you ever lower the price — ever — of a lilly drug? asked wyden, the senate finance committee's top democrat.\n\ndrug prices are too high, azar responded. i said that when i was at lilly.\n\nwhen wyden complained that azar hadn't answered his question, azar blamed the system, saying every incentive is toward higher prices.\n\nno one company is going to fix that system, azar said. that's why i want to be here working with you.\n\nas he did at his first senate hearing in november after being nominated, azar promised to make tackling drug prices his top priority.\n\ntrump has frequently attacked drug prices, including accusing pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder.\n\nrepublicans argue azar's background — both his private sector experience at lilly as well as his previous top positions at hhs during the george w. bush administration — make him uniquely qualified to address the issue.\n\ni hope i can earn your trust and your confidence, azar said tuesday.\n\nbut democrats remained skeptical.\n\nyou've indicated that you will hit the ground running. my question is: in what direction will you be running? asked sen. debbie stabenow, d-mich., before pressing azar on whether the $255 sticker price on a vial of the company's fast-acting insulin humalog is too much.\n\nazar agreed that the price is too high, but said that what's so bizarre about the health care system is lilly's net realized price — what they collect for the drug — stayed flat even as the list price for humalog went up. patients who have insurance companies negotiating prices on their behalf may not be paying more, but others are, azar acknowledged.\n\nhe called reversing the incentive for high list prices — even if that's not the price most people pay — the most important nut to crack.\n\nhe also called for increasing competition among drug makers, stopping them from exploiting protections they get from competition under patent laws, and changing federal rules to allow drug companies to be reimbursed based on the effectiveness of their product.\n\nthere's not one action that all of a sudden fixes this, he said.\n\nazar rejected sen. claire mccaskill's push to allow hhs to directly negotiate priceswith drug companies, which is prohibited by law. azar said the private companies that administer medicare's drug benefit already do a good job negotiating costs. to a get a better deal, he said, the government would have to designate a list of drugs that would be covered, excluding other treatments seniors may want. he said that's why some countries have lower drug prices than the united states does.\n\ni don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access, he said.\n\namericans surveyed last year by the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation named lowering prescription drug costs, along with lowering overall out-of-pocket health care costs, as the top health care priorities they want trump and congress to address. it's also an issue that has rare bipartisan support among respondents.\n\nsupport for the affordable care act continues to split along party lines, and democrats pressed azar on whether he would try to sabotage the obama administration's signature health policy achievement.\n\nazar said he would be obligated to make every program under his purview work as well as possible. but, what we have is not working for everybody, he added. azar said he wants to give states more flexibility in running obamacare programs, and give consumers more choice on what type of insurance they can buy.\n\nthere's not necessarily one right answer, he said. this is very complex.\n\npressed on whether he wants to cut medicare and medicaid, azar said medicare needs to be sustainable in the long term. but, he said, his energies would be focused on making it run more efficiently and effectively, rather than on changes some have proposed including an increase in the eligibility age.\n\non medicaid, azar said the trump administration's previous proposal to slow the program's rate of growth should not be considered a cut. he dismissed the notion as washington speak.\n\npressed by sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio, on whether hhs's anticipated move to allow states to impose work requirements for able-bodied medicaid recipients would hurt those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse disorder, azar said he doesn't have a definition of able-bodied. but throughout the hearing he expressed the importance of tackling the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\ni'm a hoosier so i'm right in the epicenter of the crisis in indiana, he said.\n\nazar would replace trump's first hhs secretary, tom price, who resigned in september after racking up large travel bills for chartered flights.\n\na vote on azar's nomination has not been set by sen. orrin hatch, the committee's chairman.\n\ncalling azar, one of the best public servants that i've seen in the whole time that i've been here, the utah republican said he wants to get azar confirmed as soon as we can.
why this photo of vp mike pence has a lot of people outraged\n\nin the fight to replace obamacare, vice president mike pence decided to pay the freedom caucus a visit. but it's who's missing that has everyone talking. nathan rousseau smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains.
connor turque\n\nopinion contributor\n\nthere's no way around it, bernie sanders is losing. a path to the democratic presidential nomination still exists, but it's a hail mary. he lost in 2016, too, but it was one of the most successful losses in electoral history. what were once considered radical, career jeopardizing stances on issues like single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free college became the standard by which a large chunk of the democratic electorate measures a candidate. he changed the trajectory of the democratic party.\n\nnow, nominee or not, he could do it again. as we face down the covid-19 pandemic, bernie has an unexpected chance, and an obligation. a chance to change the conversation once again, and an obligation to push joe biden as far to the left on health care as he can. he has substantial leverage to do so.\n\ncenter for disease control officials have said they are not billing for the cost of covid-19 testing, but that doesn't mean it's free, or even affordable. as a lot of us are about to find out, depending on your insurance (or lack thereof) you can expect to get a bill in the mail for a covid-19 test, in some cases for more than $3,000. the test itself might be free, but the tangential costs related to being treated in a hospital are inescapable, and can be exorbitant. nearly 28 million americans have been left uninsured by obamacare. exactly how proactive do you think they are going to be about getting tested?\n\nthat thing that bernie has been yelling about for years? this is that.\n\ncovid-19 best case for single payer\n\nif you haven't recently tuned in to cnn or msnbc (the networks that have spent the better part of the year deriding sanders, with mostly aesthetic complaints, the common refrain being that he shouts too much), their commentators are beginning to sound a lot like bernie surrogates.\n\nwe as a nation are going to get to watch, in real time, as institutions of power in america assess the value of human life against financial losses. this isn't a new or notable occurrence. but the song that's been playing quietly for years is currently being blared over a loudspeaker for everyone to hear. if the catastrophic implications of the coronavirus aren't the best possible argument for a single payer system, i don't know what is.\n\nin a recent interview with msnbc's lawrence o'donnell, democratic frontrunner joe biden suggested he might veto a medicare for all bill if one were to land on his desk. however unlikely that scenario, the disconnect it highlights between biden and a large chunk of the electorate is shocking, and would hurt him in november. he may not end up needing the youth vote bernie has a near-monopoly on to secure the nomination, but he is going to need it if he wants to beat donald trump. that means making some concessions, and showing a willingness to make some enemies in the private sector.\n\ncase for bernie:moderate democrats have a duty to consider sanders. he has a clear path to beating trump.\n\nthere's a reason major health care stocks surged by double-digits after biden's super tuesday victories. if the former vice president wins the nomination, and is serious about beating trump, he'd be wise to embrace single payer. in all 20 primary contests to date with an exit or entrance poll, most democrats — in some states as many as two-thirds or more — said they favor a government plan for all instead of private insurance.\n\nbiden needs to show me something\n\ni myself am undecided about whether i'll vote for joe if he's the nominee. there's a lot of election left and i don't need to decide today. but biden needs to show me something. like tens of thousands of other people, i've given everything i've got to fight for bernie over the past months. the thought of settling for someone who appears to share very few common goals with me is a painful one. it's also a familiar one. it cannot be overstated how little most young voters like me care about restoring some dignity of the office.\n\nwarren's choice:she has the chance to unite the left by endorsing sanders. she should take it.\n\nbernie sanders is the first politician in my lifetime whom i've heard speak about compassion in convincing, dead-serious terms. that kind of unqualified compassion at the foundation of the movement is why, even after bernie's crushing defeat in michigan, campaign volunteers stuck around in the following days to organize mutual aid with local groups to help those affected by covid-19 shutdowns.\n\nthis is a bitter, sobering moment for berners. if i'm going to be asked once again to vote for a candidate who has spent his career compromising, i'm going to need to see him compromise for me.\n\nconnor turque was a volunteer for sen. bernie sanders' 2020 presidential campaign in iowa, nevada and michigan. follow him on twitter: @turkowits
richard wolf, gregory korte, and jayne o'donnell\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — republicans won the first round thursday in a separation of powers battle against president obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: obamacare.\n\nfederal district judge rosemary collyer, a republican appointee, ruled that the law did not provide for the funds insurers need to make health insurance policies under the program affordable.\n\nwhile the law provides for tax credits, she said, it does not authorize an appropriation for slashing deductibles and copayments. without those reductions from insurers, many consumers could not afford to buy insurance.\n\ncongress authorized reduced cost-sharing but did not appropriate monies for it,, collyer said in her 38-page ruling. congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.\n\ncollyer blocked her own decision from taking effect while awaiting a likely appeal from the administration.\n\ncost-sharing subsidies reduce consumers' insurance payments — an important feature of the affordable care act, because deductibles are rising. under the law, subsidies are available to people who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, with extra assistance available for those up to 250%. for a family of four, that's about $24,000 to $61,000.\n\nthe commonwealth fund estimated up to 7 million people might have plans with cost-sharing reductions this year.\n\nthe ruling does not represent as big a threat to the health care law as two previous conservative challenges swatted down by the supreme court in 2012 and 2015. the first would have gutted the law; the second would have eliminated tax credits in many states.\n\nit's a setback, and it's a distraction … but a lot of people think the administration will win on appeal, said katherine hempstead, who heads the insurance coverage team at the robert wood johnson foundation, a public health philanthropy.\n\nhouse speaker paul ryan heralded the decision as an historic win for the constitution ... the executive branch is being held accountable.\n\nthe republican-controlled house voted to sue obama over his executive actions in july 2014. the health care lawsuit was initiated four months later.\n\njonathan turley, a george washington university law professor who represented the house of representatives in the lawsuit, called the opinion a historic ruling reaffirming congress's power of the purse.\n\njudge collyer's opinion is a resounding victory not just for congress but for our constitutional system as a whole, he said in a statement on his blog. we remain a system based on the principle of the separation of powers and the guarantee that no branch or person can govern alone.\n\nwhite house press secretary josh earnest was dismissive of the decision. it's not the first time that we've seen opponents of the affordable care act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system, he said.\n\nit's unfortunate that republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing. they've been losing this fight for six years, and they'll lose it again.\n\nelizabeth wydra, president of the liberal constitutional accountability center and the lawyer for house minority leader nancy pelosi in the court challenge, called it an unprecedented ruling allowing a partisan faction of congress to use the courts to settle a political dispute over the interpretation of a statute. she predicted it would be overruled in federal appeals court.\n\ncollyer previously denied republicans' effort to sue over another aspect of the law — the administration's unilateral delay in implementing its mandate that most large employers offer health insurance or pay a penalty. while gop opponents didn't object to delay, they argued obama lacked the authority to do it without congressional approval.\n\nhere's a link to the decision:
heidi m. przybyla\n\nusa today\n\nbernie sanders' plan to deliver medicare for all may be a good deal for many americans, but it might be bad for working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.\n\nthe democratic presidential candidate has said his universal health-care plan would result in a tax increase, including for middle and lower-income americans. but, he argues, that would be more than offset by savings from ending high-cost private health insurance plans.\n\nyet, under his plan, the nation's 8.5 million seniors over the age of 65 and already eligible for medicare would also get hit with tax increases. with more of the nation's baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than sanders' plan suggests.\n\nunder bernie's plan, everybody may well benefit, but there's going to be a substantial number of seniors who are going to feel like they're worse off, said john rother, president of the national coalition on health care, a nonpartisan coalition aiming to lower health costs. these tradeoffs are inevitable in any kind of big picture health care plan.\n\nit's the latest critique to emerge since sanders released the details of his plan hours before the last democratic debate in charleston. most of the criticism has been that sanders is promising a massive increase in benefits coverage for all americans – including for dental, mental health, vision and hearing – while assuming considerable savings that are only vaguely detailed.\n\nthe concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say.\n\nwarren gunnels, sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save. a senior working past the age of 65 making $50,000 per year would pay less than $840 for their health care, he said. a 2014 kaiser family foundation report found the average senior pays $4,734 out of pocket for health care costs, meaning they would save more than $3,800 under sanders' plan.\n\nadditionally, most seniors working past the age of 65 have additional health insurance from their employers that include premiums, deductibles and co-payments. every senior citizen in this country with less than $250,000 in income would save thousands of dollars a year, said gunnels. anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling the truth, he said.\n\nstill, austan goolsbee, the former chair of president obama's economic council, said the sanders campaign is being a little sneaky about the final tab for taxpayers, including working seniors.\n\nsanders' plan includes an additional 2.2% income tax for most americans and a 6.2% payroll tax for all employers, in addition to an estate tax and higher federal rates on the wealthiest americans.\n\nthe sanders people are just using a sleight of hand, said goolsbee, who is supporting clinton but is not working on her campaign. they're only counting the income tax part of the tax increase, and not the employer tax, he said. employers are going to make the employees pay that. if they didn't, a whole lot of these people would be laid off.\n\naccording to the nonpartisan congressional budget office, employer tax rate increases are generally passed on to employees in the form of lower wages or higher prices.\n\nas the race for the democratic nomination tightens in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire, clinton and sanders are dueling over competing visions for expanding health-care coverage. clinton says sanders would undo a decade's worth of democratic work to expand benefits via obamacare by pushing a plan that is unworkable and would never pass congress.\n\nshe advocates building on obamacare and pressuring drug companies to lower costs. sanders says obamacare isn't good enough, and that presidents including franklin roosevelt have supported a single-payer system that would dramatically lower costs by cutting out insurance companies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate prices with the government.\n\nthe sanders campaign calculates a savings, said gunnels, for seniors earning $50,000 a year even including the employer tax. fdr had a word for this line of attack, said gunnels. fdr called it 'deceit.'\n\nsanders released details of his plan following pressure from clinton and her allies. one independent analysis, by gerald friedman, an economist at the university of massachusetts at amherst, found sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the u.s. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years. sanders says the typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs.\n\nyet others, including goolsbee, say the idea assumes that most people will value the health-care benefits they will receive over the tax increases they'll experience. goolsbee, who helped craft obama's affordable care act and wants to see it continued, estimates the sanders plan would raise the government share of the economy by $20 trillion over ten years.\n\nhe's talking about government spending as a share of gdp (gross domestic product) rising dramatically to the levels they are in france, sweden, denmark, the big social democracies in europe, which we've never had, said goolsbee.\n\nthe potential downside for working seniors is among the specifics that need to be carefully considered when completely overhauling the current health-care system, said rother.\n\ni have no stake in this race, he said. medicare for all has been the slogan of a lot of people over the years, but it really is just a slogan. it doesn't really tell you much about how the program would work.''
bob goodlatte\n\nrecent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.the supreme court has decided to hear a case challenging president obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. and a federal judge recently declared that obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent congress from reviewing documents pertaining to operation fast and furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the u.s.-mexico border into the hands of criminals.\n\npresidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that congress fix this to restore our system of government. this week, the house judiciary committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the constitution.\n\nthe constitution is clear: it is the role of congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. this system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. as james madison eloquently wrote in federalist no. 47: the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\nin recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped congress to legislate from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. for example, presidents ronald reagan and george h. w. bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the obama administration. obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies congress has refused to enact. he has delayed the obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from guantanamo bay without notifying congress as required by law, just to name a few examples.\n\nthere are many reasons that this should be concerning to the american people. when a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in congress. and when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. if this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times.\n\nthe constitution affords congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. however, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. just last year, a federal judge indicated the obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by congress to fund obamacare. when the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by congress is empty and other remedies are needed.\n\nthe house judiciary committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. it will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law.\n\nadditionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. it will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions.\n\npreventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a republican or democratic issue. it is an american issue that touches the very core of the constitutional design of our government. the separation of powers and its checks and balances are designed to protect individual liberty and we must ensure that it is preserved for future generations.\n\nrep. bob goodlatte

the trump administration's decision to freeze billions in payments to health insurers with plans under obamacare that cover a higher number of sicker patients could cause health care premiums to rise in 2019.\n\nin the latest swipe at the affordable care act, which trump was unable to repeal in his first year in office, the centers for medicare & medicaid services on saturday said it was putting on hold its risk adjustment program in which it collects money from insurers with fewer high-cost plan members and transfers the funds to insurers with more high-need patients that require more expensive care.\n\nthe cms said a february federal court decision in new mexico, which ruled it was using a flawed formula to determine its collections and payments amounts, prevented it from continuing the program. the cms, which noted that a federal court in massachusetts found its formula fair, has asked the new mexico court to reconsider its decision and said it is seeking a quick resolution to the legal issue.\n\nin the meantime, some health insurers are potentially out billions of dollars. the cms said it won't be making transfer payments for the 2017 benefit year totaling $10.4 billion.\n\nthe risk-adjustment program, which does not cost taxpayers any money and is required by law, is designed to ensure that health care coverage is available for sicker, higher-cost patients by sharing the cost of covering them.\n\ninsurers criticized the payment freeze, arguing it harms consumers and will cause turmoil for the insurance industry as they move to finalize their 2019 rates.\n\nwithout a quick resolution to this matter, this action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices, scott serota, president and ceo of the blue cross blue shield association, said in a statement. it will undermine americans' access to affordable coverage, particularly for those who need medical care the most.\n\nin a separate statement, the cms said it was disappointed by the court's ruling, adding that billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold.\n\nmore:trump administration no longer will defend the affordable care act in court\n\nmore:obamacare: outreach groups nervous as trump remains silent on funding\n\nmore:health care will define the midterms. donald trump's move to gut obamacare guarantees it.\n\namerica's health insurance plans (ahip), a national association representing health insurers, said in a statement that it was discouraged by the new market disruption brought about by the decision to freeze risk adjustment payments, adding that it will create more market uncertainty.\n\nahip also said a quick resolution is needed to avoid greater harm to the individual and small group markets.
the editorial board\n\nusa today\n\nto young liberals, bernie sanders is a hero. the senator of vermont speaks truth to power and rattles cages. his win in tuesday's new hampshire primary, while narrow, makes him a front-runner for the democratic presidential nomination.\n\nto president donald trump and his supporters, however, crazy bernie is a godsend, a guy they'd love to run against. south carolina gop leaders have urged republicans to vote for him in the state's open democratic primary. and republican senators have refrained from investigations into his background.\n\none big reason for this is republicans know that large segments of the electorate would be repelled by sanders' vast expansion of government spending at a time when uncle sam is already running $1 trillion annual deficits and is more than $23 trillion in debt.\n\nincrease spending by $51.5 trillion\n\naccording to the liberal progressive policy institute, sanders' proposals would increase federal spending by a whopping $51.5 trillion over a decade. that's seven to eight times what relative moderates like joe biden and pete buttigieg are pushing. it is also more than 50 times the size of obamacare, which the congressional budget office estimated in 2010 would cost less than $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nthe biggest-ticket items on sanders' wish list include:\n\n►$24.4 trillion to finance his medicare for all proposal.\n\n►$16.3 trillion for the green new deal, far more than other candidates would spend to combat climate change.\n\n►$2.2 trillion for child care, pre-k and k-12 education.\n\n►$2.1 trillion for higher education and debt forgiveness.\n\n►$1.4 trillion for expansion of social security programs.\n\nit's true that, under medicare for all, people wouldn't have to pay private health insurance premiums any more. and sanders proposes $22.5 trillion in tax increases and military spending cuts to help offset the cost of his spending spree. but that still leaves a gap of more than $25 trillion.\n\nopposing view:we need bold solutions to today's problems\n\nas far back as the 1950s, federal spending has hovered around 20% of the u.s. economy. its highest in that span, 24.4%, was more the result of a steep recession in 2009 than a massive increase in spending.\n\nspending would be 37% of gdp\n\nif sanders were to get all of his proposals enacted, his federal government would rise to 37% of the economy, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget. this would be an enormous departure from what has been a social contract between the government and the governed.\n\nof course, a president sanders would not get all of his spending and tax proposals enacted. in 2005, president george w. bush proposed a partial social security privatization only to see it die amid fierce opposition. and the affordable care act passed by a single vote. a decade later, republicans are still fighting in the courts to repeal it.\n\ncompared with what sanders wants, those were very modest tweaks to social spending. and even they proved to be very difficult sledding.\n\nmore immediately, sanders' plans, if presented to voters, would make it considerably harder for democrats to win the white house. some of his proposals address vital issues but are simply too ambitious. others, like forgiveness for student loan debt, are unfair and unworkable from the get-go. a major expansion of government is not going to sell with suburban professionals — the demographic that swung heavily democratic in the 2018 midterms and is arguably the most fertile ground for their nominee to work this november.\n\nfor democrats, this should pose a number of questions. foremost among them: why are they spending so much time debating these costly, unrealistic plans when they should be focused on preserving obamacare protections and the rule of law?\n\nif you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
chrissie thompson and deirdre shesgreen\n\nthe cincinnati enquirer and usa today\n\nnew york — john kasich was hitting his strongest selling points, but only some of the audience was cheering.\n\ni am the only candidate who beats hillary clinton on a consistent basis, he said over the murmur of conversation and the clink of forks at the new york republican party's $1,000-a-plate, black-tie gala. do you know what will happen when you nominate people who have high negatives? he said of polls showing many americans won't vote for gop front-runners donald trump or ted cruz under any circumstance.\n\ni'm about done here, ok? i just want to tell you this, kasich said, recognizing he had lost many of the republican faithful as they dug into their dinner. i'm going to leave cleveland as the nominee. whether you believe it or not, it's going to happen. (worth noting: the gop's second-place candidate, cruz, fared even worse at the gala. when cruz talked about defeating trump in wisconsin, only one person clapped.)\n\ngop hopefuls take to the podium at n.y. gala\n\nminutes earlier, trump had taken the stage. for nearly 19 minutes, the real estate mogul told a captive audience stories about construction projects he had handled in new york, including at manhattan's grand hyatt hotel, which hosted the dinner. he spent the final eight minutes of his speech referencing prepared remarks about new york values, derided by cruz. those values, trump said, are represented by police, firefighters, transit workers and families playing in central park.\n\ntrump is going to win the gop primary tuesday in his native new york, despite general election polls showing he would trail democratic front-runner hillary clinton, the former u.s. senator these new york republicans supposedly despise. while kasich is poised for a distant second in the state, he trails both trump and cruz by hundreds of delegates in the nationwide race. this despite the fact that he's right: he is the only republican whom polls show could defeat clinton.\n\nso far, many gop voters either haven't believed those polls or don't care. but what if the polls are right?\n\nwhat if republican voters choose a candidate doomed to fail in november?\n\nautopsy called for broader gop, but party's voters felt otherwise\n\nthis was supposed to be the republican party's year. many voters are disillusioned with president obama, a democrat, saying he promised hope and change but fell short. the likely democratic nominee, clinton, has vulnerabilities, due in part to the intense dislike she engenders among some republicans and, as bernie sanders' momentum has evidenced, disillusionment among some democrats.\n\nafter mitt romney's defeat in the 2012 presidential race, republican leaders conducted an autopsy on the party to figure out what went wrong and how they could win in 2016. the central conclusion: republicans needed to broaden their appeal to women and minority voters.\n\nwe need to campaign among hispanic, black, asian, and gay americans and demonstrate we care about them, too, the report stated. america is changing demographically, and unless republicans are able to grow our appeal the way gop governors have done, the changes tilt the playing field even more in the democratic direction.\n\ninstead, many in the crowded 2016 republican field spent much of the early primary season telling voters they were more conservative than the next guy – narrowing their pitch to the hard-right and alienating those very constituencies party leaders had identified as crucial for victory. and the candidate who has done the most to offend those groups – trump – rose like a rocket.\n\nsome in the gop establishment believe the push toward an exclusionary form of conservatism started with the tea party, a movement that came into being seven years ago in response to obama's policies on health care and other issues. yet almost none of the voters the enquirer interviewed at a trump rally in pittsburgh wednesday night had considered themselves tea partiers.\n\nhe speaks his mind and tells the truth, and he talks about keeping manufacturing jobs, said matt dziak, a 23-year-old steelworker from north versailles, southeast of pittsburgh.\n\nmany tea party leaders, especially those who oppose common core educational standards and have strong evangelical backgrounds, back cruz.\n\nsteven pinsky, an independent voter from plainview, on new york's long island, had hoped this would be the presidential election in which he could vote republican for the first time since ronald reagan's tenure. but the only republican he would vote for is kasich.\n\ni believe the republican party decided that obama needed to fail, said pinsky, a 53-year-old consultant. if they worked more for america and less against obama, they'd be a lot stronger. it allowed the extremes to get a foothold in that party.\n\nall eyes are on new york for tuesday's primaries\n\ndonald trump looking for delegate sweep in new york primary\n\nsimilarly, voters like fred price jr., an african-american retiree from maryland, feel more alienated than ever in the republican party.\n\ni cannot sell trump in my community, price said. his attitude and his comments are very negative, and he's just hollering.\n\nprice, a member of the republican central committee in prince george's county, said he's concerned a president trump would shrink the federal workforce, which is a major employer of african-americans in his county.\n\nwhy would i support a person who is trying to take away what little i have? he asked. we need to have specifics of what he's going to do in our community. our issues are not the same as in the coal mines. we don't work in the coal mines.\n\nprice said he is hoping to become a delegate to the convention as a kasich supporter. i'm supporting him all the way until there's no hope for him, he said. i'm with him all the way. i don't have a second choice.\n\ntrump's supporters skeptical of general election polling\n\nfor all the polls showing trump would lose to clinton, his supporters — whether blue-collar workers or new york city donors — say the surveys may prove wrong. (indeed, trusting general election polls this early is dangerous: michael dukakis polled ahead of george h.w. bush in the spring and summer of 1988, but bush won the presidency handily that fall.)\n\ntrump hasn't started in on clinton yet, they say. the republican national committee hasn't offered its full guidance to trump.\n\nplus, said justin hernandez, of plum, a pittsburgh suburb: nobody asked me to vote in the poll.\n\nin fact, hernandez, a 21-year-old plumber, is supporting trump in part because he believes he has the best chance against clinton. we have to win this, he said.\n\nkasich is trying to claim the beat clinton argument for himself. now that the race has dwindled from 17 candidates to three, he's getting more attention, he says. the upcoming elections in new york tuesday and next week in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island — moderate east coast states where cruz may struggle — offer him a chance to boost his delegate total heading in to a possible contested convention, where he hopes to emerge as the party's choice.\n\nusa today's 2016 presidential poll tracker\n\n16 questions and answers about the 2016 gop delegate fight\n\nstill, trump is stronger than kasich in those states. in new york, where kasich is running second, trump is currently hovering at just above 50% in statewide gop polls. new york allocates 81 delegates by congressional district; if trump crests 50% in any district, he'll deny kasich or cruz any of that district's delegates. the kasich campaign has used social media to plead with anti-trump political action committees to run ads against trump in the expensive state, to little avail, leading to the suggestion that the groups are actually backing cruz.\n\nthe kasich campaign hopes the beat clinton message can also win over supporters of cruz, who have opposed kasich's support as governor for common core educational standards and for medicaid expansion under president obama's health care law.\n\nrichard morrell, 57, who owns a plumbing business on long island, plans to vote tuesday for cruz, because he supports his conservative principles.\n\nstill, he wonders whether cruz could beat clinton. polls show clinton with a slight lead over the first-term texas senator. he acknowledged kasich could possibly beat her.\n\nthen why wouldn't you vote for him in the primary? asked his brother, jack, a 53-year-old long island electrical contractor. the two had come to see kasich tape a town-hall-style interview with msnbc's chris matthews on thursday. he might not be there in the general, jack morrell told his brother.\n\nthat's a chance i have to take, richard morrell replied.\n\nwhat happens to the party?\n\nif trump loses the nomination at the convention, failing to win the primary outright and then losing when gop delegates are freed to cast votes for someone else, a few of his supporters say they'll follow him if he starts a third party. a few say they wouldn't vote republican again. but a number sigh and admit they would give the party another chance in four years.\n\nsimilarly, republicans who oppose trump or cruz say they would write off the party, but likely only until the next election.\n\nmaida barnett, a retired medical technologist of east norwich on long island, considers herself a republican, but would vote for a democrat if trump or cruz get the gop nomination. she views kasich as the most sane one.\n\nstill, barnett, 70, thinks widespread opposition from republicans to either trump or cruz could help preserve the party as she has known it.\n\nwhen somebody is so removed from the voice of the republican party, there is a voice, from the very beginning, saying: 'he does not represent the republican party. he only represents himself,'  she said.\n\nelections 2016 | usa today network\n\nalternatively, the party may well unite behind trump or cruz if they win the nomination, even if it appears they are destined to lose the general election to the democratic nominee, said john feehery, a washington gop consultant. then maybe that loss would spark the kind of soul-searching that he thinks is needed to rebuild and repair the party.\n\nthe source of the dysfunction, as feehery sees it: candidates have over-promised in recent elections, he said, and then failed to deliver because of legislative realities, creating a deep sense of betrayal among republican voters.\n\ngetting rid of the irs and obamacare is not a realistic or achievable legislative agenda, feehery said, describing campaign vows gop contenders made in 2010 and 2014. and i think it's a two-way thing. i don't think we're necessarily listening to the voters, but i don't think the voters are listening to what's doable. those misaligned policy impulses and divisions on key policy things makes it difficult for a candidate to rise who is promoting a responsible agenda.\n\ninstead, that has produced two front-runners who are more bent on political destruction than legislative victories, he said. cruz … has spent most of his campaign trying to destroy the republican party, he said, and trump wants to blow up all of washington. there's no policy attached.\n\nof kasich's pitch that he's the only one who can beat clinton in the fall, feehery said: electability in general election is not a sufficient argument. kasich has to actually win some states other than his native ohio, he said.\n\non wednesday, as kasich squeezed into a tiny ice cream shop just south of baltimore, an elderly woman tried to maneuver herself into the governor's orbit.\n\nyou're the one who can save the republican party, the 85-year-old, alice vanderwaart, called out when she was close enough.\n\nshe was quickly drowned out by other supporters who wanted to bend kasich's ear, but he seemed to hear her message. whether anyone else hears it is another question.
washington – a blockbuster abortion case is apparently on hold. a series of gun rights challenges never made it to the lineup. high-profile questions posed by donald trump's presidency are beginning to fade into irrelevance.\n\nas the supreme court returns to work friday after a three-week recess and crosses the midpoint of its term, the cases on deck are far from the type that would give the new 6-3 conservative majority a chance to assert itself in the nation's most divisive controversies.\n\nby design or by luck, the court's nine justices are so far steering clear of hostile political debates at a time when the rest of washington is still reeling from the fallout from the november election, including a second trump impeachment trial that brought to the fore images of americans storming the u.s. capitol on jan. 6.\n\nchief justice john roberts, nominated by president george w. bush in 2005, has long sought to maneuver the court around similar partisan tensions. that above-politics approach sometimes drew the ire of trump, who castigated the high court as incompetent and weak for failing to buy into his baseless claims of election fraud.\n\neven as the court is increasingly taking incoming from the trump wing of the republican party, progressives are leaning hard on president joe biden to increase the number of justices as a way to blunt the impact trump's of nominees, end lifetime appointments and impose a more rigorous code of judicial ethics.\n\nchief:trump transformed the federal courts, but john roberts still leads them\n\npacking:adding supreme court justices? progressives, biden on collision course\n\nit does seem that the court may be holding back on agreeing to decide some major issues, said stephen wermiel, a professor at american university's washington college of law, adding that it could be a deliberate effort or the byproduct of having three new justices seated over the past four years.\n\nis it letting the new conservative majority coalesce slowly? is it to keep from having the court seem as though it is on a juggernaut? he said. maybe some combination of all of those.\n\nas the court gets back to business this week, the justices will decide or hear a few cases sure to draw public attention, including the latest challenge to obamacare and a lawsuit questioning whether a catholic foster care agency can turn down gay and lesbian couples. the court's shadow docket, or emergency cases decided without argument, has bristled with disputes over religious freedom and the death penalty.\n\nstill, those cases have been the exception.\n\nabortion, guns on back burner\n\nadvocacy groups on both sides of the abortion issue are closely watching a challenge to a 2018 mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. but the case has been in limbo for months, even as some conservatives see the new majority as the best shot in generations to chip away at the 1973 roe v. wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nhold:u.s. supreme court delays decision on mississippi abortion law\n\nobamacare:supreme court appears unlikely to topple affordable care act\n\nfoster:court to decide if foster care agencies can snub gay, lesbian couples\n\nthe case has been rescheduled for consideration more than a dozen times.\n\nthe court had been set to hear oral arguments in a major case involving trump's funding of his wall on the u.s.-mexico border and trump-era asylum policies – both of which evaporated with biden's win. the court also batted aside a question about whether trump's business ties violated the constitution's anti-corruption clauses, and it has been sitting on emergency filings involving his tax returns.\n\nand last year, the justices turned aside a series of gun rights cases that groups such as the national rifle association hoped would test state and local firearms laws – leaving this year's docket free from any second amendment debate.\n\nbuffeted by politics\n\neven as roberts has tried to keep the nation's highest court above the fray, it has been buffeted by a series of bitterly fought confirmation battles, often stoked by trump's rhetoric. justice amy coney barrett's abrupt confirmation in october following the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg represented a sea change, making the court the most conservative since president franklin d. roosevelt's administration.\n\nthe 6-3 split changes the math, potentially stripping roberts of the swing-vote status he had possessed. the five other conservatives theoretically no longer need his vote to take up a case or decide it. on the other hand, barrett, justice brett kavanaugh and justice neil gorsuch are all relative newcomers who arrived at the court following bitter senate confirmation fights. the court often pumps the brakes when new justices take their seats.\n\nadding a new member to a group of nine necessarily changes the dynamic on the court, said leah litman, a professor at university of michigan law school, because the justices may have to spend time feeling out where consensus lies. litman said the pandemic has also played a role in the court's cases, forcing the justices to hold over an unusually large number of issues from last year.\n\nwhat's not clear is whether the steady-as-she-goes approach will make conservatives restless for the kind of sweeping change they have sought on abortion and other issues for years. carrie severino, president of the conservative judicial crisis network and a former clerk to justice clarence thomas, said she hoped the court isn't sidestepping.\n\nthere are significant questions at the court, but i do think we have to remember that the goal of judges isn't to dodge difficult decisions, but to decide them, she said.\n\nhealth care, voting rights on tap\n\nthough the debates have flown somewhat under the radar, the court has cut new conservative ground in shadow docket cases, shooting down regulations on religious services intended to combat coronavirus. in another emergency case, the court ruled that death row inmates may have a spiritual adviser during their execution.\n\nearly next month, the court will delve into a major voting rights case from arizona that could decide whether states may ban third-party groups from collecting mail ballots from voters and turning them in to election officials. the practice, which critics call ballot harvesting, became a major target for trump in the run-up to the election.\n\nanother case may determine whether the requirement in the 2010 affordable care act that all americans have some form of health insurance is still constitutional, even though republicans set the tax penalty for ignoring the requirement to zero. the court is also being asked to decide whether the entire obamacare law must fall because of that single provision.\n\nno singing:supreme court blocks enforcement of some california covid-19 rules\n\nthe court may also consider overruling a 30-year-old precedent about religious freedom in a dispute from philadelphia about whether the city can require a catholic foster care organization to screen same-sex couples to be foster parents.\n\nthe question is, how quickly will we see the implications of the 6-3 conservative majority, said michael c. dorf, a law professor at cornell

washington – endorsing the idea that the courts should strike down all of former president barack obama's health care law, president donald trump said tuesday that he and the republicans will embrace the issue ahead of next year's elections.\n\nthe republican party will soon be known as the party of health care – you watch, trump told reporters after the justice department asked an appeals court to uphold a texas judge's decision to invalidate the entire law known as obamacare.\n\ntrump tweeted a similar sentiment just minutes before a meeting with senate republicans on capitol hill.\n\ndemocrats said the health care issue helped them reclaim the u.s. house in last year's congressional elections, and it will help them win back the presidency next year – especially if the obama health care law is struck down.\n\nrepublicans thought they had put a scab on their self-inflicted health care wounds from 2018, but donald trump just ripped off the band-aid again by going to court to try and overturn it, said democratic strategist jesse ferguson.\n\nthe trump administration told a federal court in new orleans late monday that it would ask judges to toss out the entire affordable care act, a decision that cast further uncertainty over the future of a federal law that has extended health insurance to millions of americans.\n\nobamacare:trump administration says it will ask a court to throw out entire health law\n\nnikki haley:finland un official kai sauer slams haley over her health care remarks\n\nin a letter filed with the fifth circuit u.s. court of appeals, justice department lawyers said that a lower court's ruling that the health care law is unconstitutional should be affirmed and that the united states is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment to be reversed.\n\na coalition of republican-led states brought a lawsuit, texas v. united states, arguing the entire health law should be thrown out.\n\nin a ruling last december, u.s. district court judge reed o'connor in the northern district of texas agreed with the gop-led states' argument that the health law was unconstitutional.\n\nthe judge ruled that the constitutional foundation for the law – the requirement that people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because congress had repealed the penalty. o'connor ruled that because that provision was so central to the health law, the whole thing had to be invalidated.
steven i. weissman\n\nit is uniformly accepted dogma that our health cost crisis is caused by skyrocketing insurance premiums. this idea is completely false. it aids the most powerful lobbying group, health care, in continuing to protect hospitals, drug companies, labs and physicians from price competition.\n\nask the price of any health care service and you receive but one answer: what insurance do you have? billing is determined by how much can be extracted from each patient on a case-by-case basis.\n\nhospitalization for chest pain can result in a bill from the same hospital, for the same services, ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $25,000 or more. a simple blood test for cholesterol can range from $10 to $400 or more at the same lab.\n\nobviously, health insurers must collect sufficient premiums to pay patient costs (plus an additional amount to cover overhead and profit). in fact, under federal law insurers are required to spend 80% of all premiums collected for the actual cost of patient care.\n\nskyrocketing insurance premiums are caused by skyrocketing patient costs. period. president obama himself recognized this fact in 2009, stating: we spend one-and-a half times more per person on health care than any other country. ... this is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.\n\namericans generally don't file for bankruptcy because of the price of food, clothing, technology, housing or any other product or service. it is not a coincidence that health care, the one and only item permitted to be sold in the u.s. at different prices for different people, has imposed tremendous financial hardship — and was the top cause of personal bankruptcies in 2013. obamacare was stillborn because it allowed the predatory pricing system to continue.\n\ntrump is keeping too much of obamacare: christian schneider\n\n5 things gop won't say about obamacare: jason sattler\n\nmost depressing is what we get for our money: the world health organization ranks this nation 31st in life expectancy — behind chile and costa rica. the centers for disease control and prevention just reported that for the first time in two decades, during 2015, u.s. life expectancy actually declined.\n\nto create an affordable system, congress need only require that health care providers offer legitimate pricing: they can continue to set their own rates, but they cannot charge a different rate for each patient. price transparency initiatives would be futile without a requirement like this.\n\nlegitimate prices would empower everyone to search any medical procedure online and see pricing for all providers within x miles. it would be as easy and familiar as checking the price of any other goods or services.\n\nwith legitimate pricing, high-quality providers offering good value would thrive. innovation would spur efficiencies in the delivery of health services just like it does in every other industry.\n\nlegitimate pricing also means networks would be obsolete, along with the administrative burdens, tremendous costs and limitations on patient choice they impose.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nmedicare for all should replace obamacare: column\n\nno elected official can oppose legitimate pricing or defend our current system. the desire for legitimate health care pricing is the only totally unifying american issue. politicians might be willfully blind or just ignorant; but ordinary people understand the burden predatory health care pricing imposes on families.\n\nno matter our future health care system, no matter the scope of insurance coverage and no matter how insurance is marketed, legitimate pricing of health services is the only way to materially lower costs and premiums.\n\nsteven i. weissman, a south florida attorney, was interim president of palm springs general hospital from 2013 to 2014. he has taught as an adjunct professor at the university of miami school of law and the nova university graduate management program. last month, he delivered a petition to president trump asking him to support legitimate health care pricing.\n\nyou can read diverse opinions from our board of contributors and other writers on the opinion front page, on twitter @usatopinion and in our daily opinion newsletter. to respond to a column, submit a comment to letters@usatoday.com.
