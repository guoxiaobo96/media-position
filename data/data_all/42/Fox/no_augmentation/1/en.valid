as much as pittsburgh steelers and cleveland browns coaches want to downplay it, the mason rudolph-myles garrett fallout from their fight last year still lingers as the 2020 nfl season heads into week 17.
rudolph will start for the steelers in place of ben roethlisberger while the browns named garrett a captain for the game.
cleveland needs a win to secure a playoff berth for the first time in 18 years. with the 2019 incident still in the back of everyone's mind, rudolph said he hasn't spoken to garrett since.

he has not reached out to me in any capacity, rudolph told reporters friday, via the cleveland plain-dealer. i'm happy to hear myles out. if he wants to approach me, if he wants to talk, like i said, he's a great player. they're playing well as a defense.
garrett was suspended for the final six games of the 2019 season and may have cost himself a defensive player of the year award in the process. he accused rudolph of hurling a racial slur at him, which allegedly caused him to explode. the nfl said an investigation couldn't substantiate the claim.

garrett told reporters he doesn't anticipate giving rudolph any kind of special treatment.
he'll get hit just like everybody else. i'm not going to put a pillow underneath his head before i take him to the ground. but i'm not going to do anything extra. it's just a game. it's a steelers game. it's a divisional game. it's an important game. but going against him, it changes nothing for me, he said.
and, just like with any other player or any other quarterback, if he reaches out his hand for me to help him up, i'm going to do it. and if i see him and he's on the ground, it doesn't change my mindset at all with him back there.

garrett said in september he hoped to clear the air with rudolph as the incident nearly made him quit football altogether.
road trip? for many vacationers across the country, travel plans are jammed in neutral, as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight. it's frustrating. it seems like we do this more and more, year after year, said eric kelso, a frequent parks visitor who's cutting his trip to joshua tree national park short this year.
martha stewart shares bizarre hack for making scrambled eggs: 'the whitest thing i've ever seen'
most national parks, museums, and other government institutions remain shuttered for the time being, forcing many travelers to change their vacation plans or scrap them altogether. sarah ellis sparks made a lengthy journey to washington to explore america's history at the smithsonian and other institutions, only to be met with disappointment instead of national treasures. they need to open everything up because people are coming from like...i'm coming from alabama, i flew down here -- to see nothing, she said.
vacationers aren't the only ones feeling the squeeze. the u.s. travel association reports the shutdown is costing the industry more than $100 million a day. that means tour operations need to change plans too. some 82 percent say they've adjusted itineraries – with almost half reporting major cancellations. they're more slowed in terms of those parts of the industry. you know, the parks are open but certain portions or parts of the parks are closed down, said zach burau, founder of the subscription travel service wanderlift.

it's a big gamble for vacationers who roll the dice and go forward with their plans. many park visitors, like sven schumacher, say they need to seek out non-government services and lodging – sometimes at higher prices. they are independent of the government shutdown which was good for us and we also had to choose them because on the homepages and also on the phones the people were not available so there was a huge impact.
travel experts expect losses to keep piling up as long as the government remains shut down. if this thing goes on past a month and a half or two months, i think you will see some effects and then the severity of those effects could continue as the shutdown goes on, burau said.

a prolonged shutdown could impact travel further down the road when it comes to booking trips now. about 800,000 federal workers are expected to miss paychecks this week.

democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the white house and across the country on thursday, just one day before the partial government shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck.
as president trump visited the southern border in mcallen, texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began dec. 22.
roughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and are working unpaid. an additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. on thursday afternon, after assurances from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., that president trump will sign the bill, the senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the ongoing government shut down.
statistics provided by the department of labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of december, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
shutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in washington, d.c., on thursday. some near the white house chanted, do your jobs, so we can do ours.
ladies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government -- of the people, for the people and by the people, hoyer continued.
also speaking at the rally, democratic virginia sen. mark warner accused trump of using federal workers as pawns.
protesters initially gathered near the afl-cio building in washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on republicans.
let's call this shutdown what it is: it's a lockout, afl-cio president richard trumka shouted. shame on the senate. shame on the white house. this lockout has to end, and it has to end now.
two large unions representing federal workers -- the american federation of government employees and the national treasury employees union -- have argued it is illegal to force workers to show up to their jobs without pay.
vermont independent sen. bernie sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to trump's tuesday night address from the oval office, also rallied attendees on thursday. sanders has consistently accused the white house of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.
today we say to this president, 'grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,' sanders said.
maryland democratic sens. benjamin cardin and chris van hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did connecticut democratic sen. richard blumenthal.
other rallies were taking place in atlanta, denver and ogden, utah, where some 5,000 irs workers are affected by the shutdown, according to kuer npr utah. a local food bank reported that 50 percent more families have showed up this week than the last.
democrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid transportation security administration (tsa) officials are calling out sick at airports.
watch: airports report longer security lines as tsa agents call out sick
he thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, house speaker nancy pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the white house on wednesday. but they can't. (trump walked out of the meeting after pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)
although trump has said that most of the people not getting paid are democrats, he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown.
i can relate, trump told reporters this weekend. and i'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. they always do. and they'll make adjustments. people understand exactly what's going on. many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what i'm doing.
there is not gonna be any bend right here, trump added.
the shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.
trump again asserts power to declare national emergency during border visit
some workers are relying on donations, including launching gofundme campaigns. a food pantry has opened up at a coast guard base in boston.
gabrielle roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on twitter: applied for unemployment....even though i have a job... surreal.
essential government workers, like tsa agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. while furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.
however, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.

theodore atkinson, a furloughed trial attorney in the justice department's civil division, told the associated press he is spending extraordinarily stressful days anxiously watching the news at his home in baltimore.
he was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. but this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said.
with two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. but if the shutdown stretches into february, he may need to take out another.
it's all uncertain and i don't know how it ends or resolves itself, he said. this isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. i can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.

negotiations to end the shutdown stalled on thursday, as trump, during his visit to the u.s.-mexico border in texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.
trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in mcallen. the president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.
if we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, trump said of human trafficking. the president then took part in a briefing by border agents.
back in washington, democrats on thursday were blocked in the senate after trying to proceed with house-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. sen. mitch mcconnell, the republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.

japan declared a state of emergency in tokyo and three nearby areas on thursday as coronavirus cases continue to surge, hitting a daily record of 2,447 in the capital.
prime minister yoshihide suga issued the declaration at the government task force for the coronavirus. it lasts from friday until feb. 7, and centers around asking restaurants and bars to close at 8 p.m. and people to stay home and not mingle in crowds.
the declaration carries no penalties. but it works as a strong request while japan juggles to keep its economy going.
japanese governors demand state of emergency over covid
shopping malls and schools will remain open. movie theaters, museums and other events will be asked to reduce attendance. places that defy the request will be publicized on a list, while those that comply will be eligible for aid, according to officials.
i am confident we can overcome this, but i must ask all of you to endure a restricted life for a while longer, suga told reporters after the declaration.
he promised more aid for hospitals treating covid-19 patients. the japanese military is ready to help, and efforts are underway to get a vaccine approved and delivered, he added.
please take this matter seriously as your own, to protect all precious life, your parents, your grandparents, family and friends, over generations, suga said.
coronavirus cases have been surging in japan following year-end and new year's holidays.
shigeru omi, a doctor who heads the government panel on coronavirus measures, described the latest wave as explosive, requiring the emergency declaration.
tokyo has logged record numbers of daily cases for two straight days, after 1,591 on wednesday. nationwide, cases have been growing steadily by more than 5,000 a day.
some experts say japan should have acted sooner, and a government campaign to promote domestic travel through discounts was a mistake.
opinion on having eateries close early is mixed, since places could simply get more crowded in earlier hours.
dr. hiroshi nishiura, an expert on infectious diseases, said the rate of increase in number of cases will decline but infections will continue to rise. he believes more drastic action is needed.
vaccinations are expected to start next month in japan, with health and essential workers first. the rollout is likely to take months.
dr. atsuo hamada, an expert on infections and professor at tokyo medical university hospital, said curtailing nighttime drinking and dining will help.
when people go out to eat at night, they tend to get drunk, talk in loud voices and sing so airborne infections spread more quickly, he said in a recent telephone interview.
keeping covid-19 infections under control is imperative for japan with the tokyo olympics set for july. politicians have repeatedly stressed it must go on despite an increasingly doubtful public.
spreading virus pulls olympic torches off display in japan
a similar state of emergency was issued last april through late may, and was eventually widened to apply nationwide.
the effort was largely effective. japanese tend to follow orders from authorities, even without the threat of penalties. almost everyone has been wearing masks.
a legal change is needed to allow for penalties in emergency declarations, and such a move is set to be considered in parliament. a strict lockdown, like ones in europe, is not being considered.
yoshimasa maruyama, chief economist at smbc nikko securities, said the economic damage from the declaration will be limited, with real gross domestic product growth likely to be pushed down by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021.
the emergency last year affected a wider part of the economy, and it coincided with the time when the economy was already struggling amid plunging global trade, he said.
other economists are projecting a slightly greater negative impact on gdp.
during the second quarter last year, japan's economy shrank nearly 8%, but has gradually rebounded, growing 5% in the july-september 2020 period.
trade has stagnated, although hopes are high for a gradual recovery. some parts of asia have not been as affected by the coronavirus as the u.s. and europe.
still, the restaurant and hotel sectors will be slammed, and government assistance is needed, maruyama said.
shingo sakai, who runs la rochelle french cuisine restaurants in tokyo, said fine dining takes more than two hours, and his customers usually don't get out of the office until after 6 p.m.
we have to keep our dining quality, and at the same time we need to keep our reputation by following the government order, he said.
i have to think about cutting costs to keep the company alive. there's no place to cut costs because i did that for the last six months. there's no room for that.
japan's unemployment rate has risen, but has not shot up, hovering at about 3%. bankruptcies related to the coronavirus total about 800 so far, high for japan, according to tokyo shoko research.
but shopping districts have been packed, a situation that has contributed to the most recent virus wave.

some 250,000 cases have been confirmed nationwide with more than 3,700 deaths, according to the health ministry. hospitals are getting stretched thin.
tokyo gov. yuriko koike and the heads of neighboring saitama, chiba and kanagawa prefectures asked the government for the emergency declaration over the weekend.
we need to now recognize that virus infections have entered a totally new stage, she said. tokyo is making the protection of human life a top priority.
shame on mitt romney. publishing an ad hominem attack on president trump in the washington post on the cusp of occupying a senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the oval office was dishonorable. in addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about romney: that he is not to be trusted.
you have to ask, what was the senator-elect from utah thinking? that by proclaiming that president trump had not risen to the mantle of the office romney would protect himself from a trumpian taint? to what end? it's hard to imagine.
it is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a gop-turncoat talking head, as ex-sen. jeff flake, r-ariz., may hope to become. last year, anti-trumper flake met with msnbc president phil griffin and cnn's chief jeff zucker, sparking speculation that post-senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.
liz peek: let's look past the liberal media gloom factory and celebrate the good news this christmas
that's not romney's situation. could it be that romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and vice president mike pence at the same time? does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case gop leaders have to go to their bench? it isn't going to happen.
and especially after writing the anti-trump op-ed. republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a gallup poll.
click here to get the fox news app
after his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, romney made the rounds of important republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. i spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. the near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.
that isn't to say that many republican voters don't regret romney's defeat. the former massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than barack obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.
also, romney had foreign policy chops. his comments about russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by president obama, who thought he knew better.
but, romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. millions of americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the u.s. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected donald trump.
romney would not have pulled us out of the paris climate agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. he would have been too polite to throw over the iran nuke deal, or to confront the chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our nato allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put america first.
in his op-ed in the washington post, romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align u.s. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on china's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.
but would mitt have done those things? would he have stood behind supreme court nominee (and now justice) brett kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?
no, we saw during his 2012 campaign that romney did not have the steel to go the distance. after he trounced obama in the first debate between the two, romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.
romney refused to go after obama on the shameful lies about the deaths of americans in benghazi, wouldn't challenge the president on his handling of the auto industry meltdown and allowed democrats to paint him as anti-female.
mitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump.
if he couldn't stand up to obama, how would romney have fared with chinese president xi jinping?
but there is a more profound reason that romney lost to obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. while president trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. maybe he thought american voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.
mitt romney helped create or rebuild great companies like staples, sealy (the mattress firm) and the sports authority, creating wealth not only for his firm bain capital but also for investors. those businesses also created thousands of jobs. romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.
that is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from romney's presidential campaign. running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.
mitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump. he is not alone. there are reasons why many republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and romney's op-ed detailed many of those.
but a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the american voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.
i am disappointed that romney chose to do otherwise.

the topic is discussed so often it might seem like old news, yet ongoing questions about the future of aircraft carriers are as, if not more, relevant today than at any other time. are carriers obsolete? are they too large and vulnerable to long-range precision carrier-killer missiles to operate close enough to shore to project power? will the navy architect a new generation of differently configured carriers? perhaps smaller, faster and more agile?
to the extent that the navy's recently released 30-year shipbuilding plan offers a glimpse into current thinking about future naval warfare, it is clear that the question will continue to receive very significant attention. the text of the plan states that, moving through the next five years and beyond, the navy plans to analyze carrier evolution, by writing that the service continues to meet full funding requirements for cvn 80/81 and advanced procurement for a cvn in 2026. the department also recognizes the need for continued exploration of carrier evolution and expects to conduct an analysis of alternatives within the fydp (five year defense spending plan) to inform potential requirements.
cvn 80 and 81, the third and fourth ford-class carriers, are already well underway following the successful construction of the first-in-class uss ford which is now nearing deployment.
navy accelerates new ship radar to support emerging 'sea-attack' strategy
the question regarding the future has been studied extensively in recent years through a number of formal navy studies, and many weapons developers continue to ponder a range of potential contingencies. some of these include greater use of f-35b armed amphibious assault ships for carrier-like power projection missions. certainly, having 5th gen attack capability extends the tactical and operational envelope for amphibs, and newer amphibs are being engineered with new abilities to command and control large fleets of surface, air and even undersea drones. would amphibs be less vulnerable targets sufficiently capable of sustaining a high-op tempo sortie rate for maritime attack?
other major factors include the large-scale incorporation of surface, air and undersea drones, meaning carriers could operate at safer standoff distances when enabled by new platforms such as the mq-25 stingray, a first-of-its-kind drone able to nearly double the strike range of carrier-launched fighter jets such as f-35s and f/a-18s. then there is the question of evolving ship defenses, meaning newer kinds of layered defense weapons to include ew (electronic warfare), lasers, aerial sensor nodes, advanced radar and faster computer processing for fire control all continue to massively improve carriers' ability to operate safely in high-threat environments such as waters within striking range of china's heavily touted carrier-killer df-26 and df-21d anti-ship missiles. fast-evolving ship defense technologies are likely one reason why senior navy leaders continue to emphasize that u.s. carriers are going nowhere soon and can operate wherever they need to, whenever they need to when called upon. while the mission to project massive attack power from the sea is by any estimation here to stay, its particular size, shape and technological configuration certainly may evolve.
click here to get the fox news app
drone evolution may be the hidden key to all of this in several respects. certainly the navy's mq-25 will not be the only carrier-launched drone to emerge, as others will likely follow, and how about the idea of large unmanned carrier-like platforms launching unmanned strike assets? all while command and control operations are performed by human sailors at safer standoff ranges? that would certainly change the equation when it comes to operating in high-risk areas more vulnerable to enemy fire. as part of this equation, it would seem important to point out that the navy is already well on the way to engineering new large unmanned ships such as the medium and large unmanned surface vessel programs. large drone boats could perform anti-submarine warfare, conduct reconnaissance operations and even coordinate strikes for aircraft from strategically vital vantage points enabling maritime forces to project power from wherever needed.

james corden shared a message of hope with his audience after violence broke out at the capitol building on wednesday.
the late-night host was among the first to comment on the events that took place at the capitol in his opening monologue, which was shared ahead of his wednesday night broadcast on cbs. in it, the host, who is operating out of his garage due to increased coronavirus cases in los angeles, looked visibly rattled as he went over the events that happened earlier in the day.
what a crazy… sad day, he began. a day that will go down as a dark one in the long history of america. we've all sat today, glued to the pictures of trump supporters breaching the capitol, fighting with police, shouting in the chambers of congress or flagrantly popping a selfie as they sit with their feet up in the government's offices.
the host, like many celebrities, then turned his attention to donald trump's role in the situation.
fans shocked that james corden doesn't always drive on 'carpool karaoke'
then under the pretense of trying to calm the situation, their hero, the president, released a message this afternoon to tell his supporters that they're special and we love you. i wouldn't want to even imagine his treatment or response to those people if they had been wearing black lives matter hats instead of red maga ones, he said.
the british comedian noted that, despite how upset or hopeless people may feel in the wake of what happened, he says growing up idolizing america from afar is helping him maintain hope for the nation.
because i think if there is one thing that we can have after the last month in this country, it's hope, he continued. you know, as an outsider growing up in england, i used to look to america as this beacon of light and possibility. a place where anything can happen, a place where you'd be lucky to work. a place where many people that i knew used to fantasize about living here. a place that gives an individual more opportunity than they would get elsewhere but cares for their fellow man.
james corden teases he may leave 'late late show' and move back to uk
he continued: today people across the world would have looked at these pictures from washington and wondered, 'what on earth has happened to this great country?' but i truly believe, and make no mistake, that they know that the america that they admire still exists. they know that the america that so many aspire to will be back. it's just been hijacked by a lunatic and his crazy army for the last four years.
corden went on to note that people have reason to be hopeful because, in two weeks, on those same steps, where that mob fought and pushed passed police, joe biden will be sworn in as the president of the united states.

he went on to note how inspired he feels at seeing the victory of democratic senate candidates jon ossoff and raphael warnock in georgia, whose victory on wednesday solidified the party's control of the senate going into biden's presidency.

today was the last dance at the worst party we've ever been to, corden concluded. so if you can, have hope. you've seen in these past two weeks that voting counts, change is coming, science is real, vaccines are on the way. i really do believe that there are better times ahead.
after a year plagued by privacy scandals, hate speech controversies, the viral spread of disinformation and the public airing of his company's internal communication, facebook ceo mark zuckerberg used his year-end note to focus on the positive ー drawing the scorn of critics who blasted the billionaire as tone deaf and out of touch.
as he looked back on a year that saw his company's stock price drop and scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle calling for new, strict privacy regulations in the wake of cambridge analytica, zuckerberg spent a chunk of his note boasting that 2 billion people now use one of facebook's services and the tech giant has empowered countless small businesses.
i'm proud of the progress we've made, he wrote in the letter, which notes that facebook now employs 30,000 people who focus on safety, but does not dwell on the specifics of any particular challenge or scandal.
zuckerberg wrote that facebook is a very different company than it was two years ago and has fundamentally altered [its] dna to prioritize the prevention of harm. he also wrote that he learned a lot in the last year, but a range of critics took issue with the tone of his note.

when read as a whole, the post simply confirms one thing about facebook. no change has affected (or is designed to affect) the leading cause of facebook's problems ー the business model, wrote paul armstrong, a tech adviser, in forbes. without this, facebook is doomed to become irrelevant to other platforms or become extremely dangerous and be broken up.
armstrong's advice to facebook for 2019 includes banning all political advertising, atomic bombing facebook's algorithm-driven newsfeed and verifying all news sources on the network.
mark zuckerberg is a bit out of touch with people's perception, mark douglas, ceo of digital advertising platform steelhouse, told cheddar. it's going to be a rocky year, that's clear.
they are the least trusted company in tech. they are going to have to rebuild the trust with the users or they are going to lose those users, douglas explained.
chinese schools enforce 'smart uniforms' with gps tracking to surveil students
although facebook has continued to see its monthly active users increase globally, the company is confronting flat growth in parts of north america and decreased growth in europe. besides that fact that it was harnessed by russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, facebook confronted a series of false rumors on whatsapp, which it also owns, that led to more than 20 people being lynched in india.
cesar sayoc, who stands accused of sending 13 pipe bombs through the mail to a range of prominent democrats and critics of president trump, trafficked in conspiracy theories, white supremacy and anti-semitism on his facebook profile. and the menlo park, calif. company stands accused of furthering ethnic cleansing in myanmar, where the military has targeted the country's mostly muslim rohingya minority group with severe violence.
a number of critics called on zuckerberg to step down or take a break from leading the company.
leslie miley, former cto of the obama foundation, said the 34-year-old silicon valley executive should resign and find a pursuit that will teach him humility and help him find his moral compass.
the executive director of color of change, a racial advocacy group that has tangled with facebook over its treatment of minorities, told the guardian that zuckerberg desperately needs to begin implementing systemic solutions, in a way that is transparent, rebuilds the public trust and provides a safer platform for all people.
new year's eve times square drone grounded due to weather, nypd says
the head of the electronic frontier foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization, told the guardian that zuckerberg should find a new job in 2019, while techcrunch called the ceo's letter tone deaf.
some other critics were not as harsh.
it means personally committing to a facebook that doesn't accidentally make decisions that aid violent regimes, white supremacists and other bad actors, dia kayyali, program manager at witness, told the guardian. above all, it means simply being honest about facebook's largely detrimental role in global society. that would be the biggest challenge of all
facebook has managed to make enemies on both sides of the aisle on capitol hill, with democrats calling for more regulation and some republicans claiming the network is biased against them, and it faces ftc and fbi probes.
2019 is not starting out better, that's for sure, douglas said.
cnn's legal analyst jeffrey toobin, who is currently away from the network amid a masturbation scandal, on wednesday morning sent a cryptic tweet declaring he'll be back before quickly deleting it.
many thanks. i'l be back, toobin wrote in the now-deleted tweet.
it is unclear if toobin intended to send someone a private message or if he simply had a change of heart and deleted the public message. it is also unclear if he meant he'll be back on cnn, the network that granted him a leave of absence following reports of his lewd behavior.

cnn has not taken action against the tech-challenged toobin and has remained silent about his status at the network despite recently hiring contributor evan osnos, who is also a staff writer at the new yorker and was reportedly an eyewitness to toobin's alleged misconduct on the infamous zoom call.
cnn did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding toobin's tweet and has stayed mum on toobin's status.
the new york times on tuesday published a lengthy article on the situation headlined, the undoing of jeffrey toobin, that featured a cnn staffer hinting the network will give him an opportunity to return and noted that he was still employed by the liberal network.
cnn says jeffrey toobin still employed as report suggests he may get second chance after masturbation scandal
three cnn employees say that network president, jeff zucker, is a big fan of mr. toobin's and a believer in second chances, the times reported.
the times also reported new details of the incident.
[toobin] was seen lowering and raising his computer camera, exposing and touching his penis, and motioning an air kiss to someone other than his colleagues, witness masha gessen told the times. i was really, truly shocked.
last year, thewrap founder and ceo sharon waxman – a women's rights advocate – wrote that toobin's situation reeks of male privilege and asked where cnn has been.

when your job is to weigh facts and render conclusions that shape public opinion, one's own judgment should matter, waxman wrote, noting that cnn has persistently avoided all questions about his future at the network.
waxman wrote that she spoke to several prominent women in media who all agreed that a woman would never be able to get away with similar actions.
bacteria on the international space station are evolving and changing in their strange orbital environment -- but according to a new study, they don't seem to be any more dangerous to humans.
that's good news for astronauts, as some previous research suggested that space travel might make certain microbes mutate into strains that are more harmful to people.
there has been a lot of speculation about radiation, microgravity and the lack of ventilation and how that might affect living organisms, including bacteria, lead study author erica hartmann, a biological design professor at northwestern university, said in a statement. these are stressful, harsh conditions, leading researchers to wonder if space travel would increase the odds that bacteria would evolve into so-called superbugs to survive.
based on the new study, published today (jan. 8) in the journal msystems, the answer appears to be 'no,' hartmann said.
in the study, researchers analyzed dna from two kinds of bacteria that had taken a trip to the iss: staphylococcus aureus (which is found on skin and causes staph infections) and bacillus cereus (which is present in digestive systems and soil and usually harmless). both microbes were collected from the ambient environment of the space station and probably hitched a ride to space on the skin of astronauts or inside their bodies. the results revealed that while the returned bacteria had mutated differently than their earthbound counterparts, they hadn't developed any of the obvious genetic traits of superbugs. (superbugs are bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics.) [over earth: day & night from iss]
on earth, the researchers said, bacteria routinely fall away from the human bodies they prefer to inhabit and undergo changes to adapt to nonliving surfaces. but researchers were especially concerned that the close quarters of spacecraft, where humans and bacteria share the same air and small spaces for months on end, might produce dangerous changes.
it seems, however, that while the bacteria did change themselves to adapt to space, those changes didn't produce any abnormalities that would make them produce diseases that would be more infectious or difficult to treat.
this is good news for long-term spaceflight. while nasa's rigorous quarantine procedures before launches have made infectious diseases in space exceedingly rare, the prospect of an outbreak in a sealed spacecraft speeding toward mars remains alarming. so far, though, it seems that nothing about the space environment itself is working to make that bacterial risk any more dire — even if there are other health issues to worry about.
the two u.s. senate runoff elections that will be held in georgia tuesday will determine whether the senate will work in partnership with president-elect joe biden to build a better future for americans, or whether republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.
georgia is a formerly red state that turned semi-blue in november, when a majority of voters wisely cast their ballots for former vice president biden.
and yes, despite president trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that biden carried georgia. trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.
richard fowler: in georgia senate races, key voting bloc gives democrats excellent chance of winning
it's in the national interest for georgia voters to follow up on their support for president-elect biden by voting tuesday to elect democrats jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock to the senate. both men are highly qualified. their election will give biden the democratic majority he needs in the senate to repair the enormous damage trump has caused to our nation in the past four years.
the incoming administration of president-elect biden and vice president-elect kamala harris needs a senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.
unfortunately and disgracefully, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the biden administration.
recall that mcconnell famously stated in 2010: the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one-term president.
so mcconnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the american people. not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. no, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt president obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the american people. you can bet every penny you have that mcconell feels the same way about our incoming president.
the best way to stop mcconnell is to elect ossoff and warnock to give democrats 50 senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 republican senators. vice president harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give democrats majority control of the senate.
taking a page from trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, republican sens. kelly loeffler (running against warnock) and david perdue (running against ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective democratic challengers as radical socialists.
nothing could be further from the truth.
trump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in georgia or across the united states in the november election, and i don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in georgia.
the truth is that warnock and ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo president-elect biden's hopeful unifying message. they are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering georgians in these perilous times.
warnock, the only black candidate in the tuesday runoff, is the senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the former pulpit of the rev. dr. martin luther king jr.
the demonization of this pastor who now preaches in dr. king's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in georgia of hostility to its black residents. in fact, georgia has never elected a single black u.s. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. and yet the census bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is black.
warnock rose in georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand medicaid for low-income residents of the state. he supports increased covid-19 relief funding, expanding the affordable care act (the aca, also known as obamacare), and passing the john lewis voting rights act.
warnock has been endorsed by former presidents jimmy carter (a fellow georgian) and obama, and by former u.n. ambassador and atlanta mayor andrew young. warnock is also backed by former democratic candidate for governor of georgia and georgia house of representatives minority leader stacey abrams of fair fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in georgia.
ossoff is a georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. he also previously worked as a national security aide for rep. hank johnson, d-ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.
like warnock, ossoff supports strengthening the aca, increased covid-19 relief, criminal justice reform, and lower taxes for working families and small businesses in georgia.

loeffler and perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge president-elect biden's victory. they agree with anything trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. they act as if they are running to be selected by trump to be his employees on the apprentice, rather than to represent the people of georgia in the senate.
loeffler and perdue were both against additional $2,000 covid-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after trump's belated tweet storm). they have both questioned the integrity of the november election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow republican, georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger.
truth be told, loeffler and perdue — not warnock and ossoff — are the radical candidates running in georgia. the republican candidates are out-of-touch with georgia voters and values and reject their senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic. their only loyalty is to donald trump and to their own self-interest.

i implore georgians to turn history on its head and to get out the vote for democratic candidates raphael warnock and jon ossoff on tuesday. record numbers of early votes are a good sign for the two democrats, but the election will be close and now they need as many supporters as possible to vote tuesday.
all eyes are on you, georgia. the health, safety and security of the american people are at stake.

billionaire tom steyer, the outspoken liberal megadonor and former hedge fund manager who has led a campaign for president trump's immediate impeachment, will not run for president in 2020, he announced wednesday.
instead, steyer, who spoke at an event in des moines, iowa, declared that he will undertake and oversee a laundry list of activities in 2019 aimed at removing trump from office.
most people come to iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president, steyer said in his prepared remarks. but i am proud to be here to announce that i will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.
among steyer's goals: a multi-million dollar digital initiative aimed at informing the public and members of congress about the 10 impeachable offenses that trump has already committed, town halls across the country, and even an impeachment summit in late january that will bring more than 250 supporters from across the country to d.c. together to learn about historical precedent for impeachment.
that summit, steyer promised, would be followed by an advocacy day that will include impeachment summit participants fanning out across capitol hill to hand deliver articles of impeachment drafted by legal scholars to members of congress with the simple message: 'we did half the work, now it's up to you to finish the job.'
steyer vowed in a statement to spend 100% of his time and energy focused on removing donald trump from power through the group need to impeach, which he founded in october 2017. he committed to spending $40 million on the effort to have trump removed from office in 2019.
dems react after new congresswoman vowed to 'impeach the motherf---er'
this is the biggest issue in american politics today, steyer said in his speech wednesday. we have a lawless president in the white house who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. donald trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in america — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. it is past time for members of congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. the question remaining is, what will congress do?
steyer had been considered by many analysts to be a potential contender for the white house, and had taken apparent steps in that direction. in recent months he ran television advertisements in which he appeared personally to call for trump's removal, appeared at numerous political events, and even named a potential campaign manager.
in early december, steyer laid the groundwork for a political platform, speaking alongside a panel in charleston, s.c., at one of five scheduled town halls. each event focused on the five rights of his potential campaign platform, which he called the social contract for the 21st century.
while some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.
in 2013 he founded nextgen america, a political action committee and nonprofit working to combat climate change.
like massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who has announced that she's formed an exploratory committee ahead of a possible presidential run, steyer often has tangled publicly and personally with trump.
last october, trump took a personal shot at steyer, deriding him as a wacky and crazed & stumbling lunatic and asserting that if he is running for president, the dems will eat him alive!
the remarks came after steyer -- among the prominent liberals who received a threatening suspicious package earlier in the month -- said he absolutely was blaming trump for creating an atmosphere in which anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.
steyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken trump supporter in florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a pittsburgh synagogue in late october.

although steyer seemingly won't be on the ballot in 2020, members of his team emphasized that they felt the democrats had momentum.
with a new congress now seated, and a majority of democrats in the house, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, need to impeach lead strategist kevin mack said in a statement. we're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of congress accountable until donald trump is out of the white house.
but, top democrats seemed less than enthusiastic about introducing impeachment articles. last week, house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., downplayed freshman rep. rashida tlaib's profanity-laced vow to impeach trump, as republicans strongly condemned the language.
meanwhile, house majority leader steny hoyer said he didn't think comments like these particularly help. and rep. emanuel cleaver, d-mo., said members were aghast at tlaib, d-mich., lamenting a fever among some colleagues to impeach trump.
house judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler, d-n.y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned tlaib's comments.
i don't like that language, nadler told cnn. more to the point, i disagree with what she said. it is too early to talk about that intelligently. we have to follow the facts and get the facts.

the russian hypersonic weapons test is shining light upon an aggressive u.s. plan to prototype, test and deploy hypersonic weapons on an expedited schedule -- to defend against enemy attacks by fast-tracking an ability to launch high-impact, high-speed attacks at mach. 5 - five times the speed of sound.
we would like all the resources we can build into the kill chain to hit any target or hold it at risk with hypersonic weapons, gen. timothy ray, air force global strike command, said at the air force association air, space & cyber conference in september.
russian president vladimir putin is, according to numerous news reports and russia's own state news operation, calling the test a tremendous success, adding that the weapon is invincible and ready to enter service next year.
the actual technological capacity of the new russian weapon has not, as of yet, been verified by public u.s. reports.
legitimate or not, a russian weapon traveling at hypersonic speeds, naturally, would better enable offensive missile strikes to destroy targets such and enemy ships, buildings, air defenses and even drones and fixed-wing or rotary aircraft -- depending upon the guidance technology available.
a key component of this is the fact that weapons traveling at hypersonic speeds would present serious complications for targets hoping to defend against them – they would have only seconds with which to respond or defend against an approaching or incoming attack.
in fact, while emphasizing the current air force push for hypersonic weapons, ray raised this precise concern.
the challenges becomes your ability to defend against hypersonic weapons - they are not easily defendable, ray told an audience at the afa conference.
along these lines, the advent of hypersonic weapons is a key reason why some are questioning the future survivability of large platforms such as aircraft carriers. how are ship-based sensors, radar and layered defenses expected to succeed in detecting tracking and intercepting or destroying an approaching hypersonic weapon traveling at five times the speed of sound?
hypersonic weapons will quite likely be engineered as kinetic energy strike weapons, meaning they will not use explosives but rather rely upon sheer speed and the force of impact to destroy targets, developers explain.
a super high-speed drone or isr platform would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar or shot down.
a drone or unmanned isr platform traveling at hypersonic speeds would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar. (mitchell institute for aerospace studies report on hypersonic weapons here)
although potential defensive uses for hypersonic weapons, interceptors or vehicles are by no means beyond the realm of consideration, the principal effort at the moment is to engineer offensive weapons able to quickly destroy enemy targets at great distances.
scientists explain that speed of sound can vary, depending upon the altitude; at the ground level it is roughly 1,100 feet per second. accordingly, if a weapon is engineered with 2,000 seconds worth of fuel – it can travel up to 2,000 miles to a target, former air force chief scientist gregory zacharias told warrior in a previous interview.
the service recently awarded a second deal to lockheed to expedite prototyping of a hypersonic weapon, called the air launched rapid response weapon, air force news reported.
the effort involves two separate trajectories, including the air-launched rapid response weapon and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon. the air force has now awarded developmental deals for both systems to lockheed.
the most recent award was cited recently in the service's around the air force new report, which said that air force secretary heather wilson is moving as fast as possible when it comes to hypersonic weapons.
recent thinking from senior air force weapons developers had held that u.s. hypersonic weapons might first be deployable by the early 2020s. hypersonic drones for attack or isr missions, by extension, were thought to be on track to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s, senior service officials have told warrior maven.
now, this aggressive new air force hypersonic weapons prototyping and demonstration effort is expected to change this time frame in a substantial way.
a boost-glide hypersonic weapon is one that flies on an upward trajectory up into the earth's atmosphere before using the speed of its descent to hit and destroy targets, senior officials said.
the hypersonic conventional strike weapon effort involves using technologies which have not yet been integrated for air-launched delivery, an air force spokeswoman told warrior maven earlier this year.
these kinds of propulsion and weapons technologies are currently informing the exploration of hypersonic drone platforms able to surveil, strike and defend.
lockheed's skunk works division is currently working with the pentagon on the sr-72 hypersonic drone, designed to travel at mach 6. visions for this platform, according to reports from popular mechanics and aviation week, incorporate engineering the drone for strike missions as well. current plans call for a flight research vehicle to be constructed in the early 2020s, with a full-scale version to be in service sometime in the 2030s, the av week report states.
senior air force weapons developers have explained the rationale in terms of not waiting many more years for a 100-percent solution if a highly impactful 90-percent solution can be available much sooner.
often referred to as agile acquisition by air force senior leaders, to include service secretary heather wilson, fast-tracked procurement efforts seek quicker turnaround of new software enhancements, innovations and promising combat technologies likely to have a substantial near-term impact. while multi-year developmental programs are by no means disappearing, the idea is to circumvent some of the more bureaucratic and cumbersome elements of the acquisition process.
this hypersonic weapons acceleration is taking place within a high-threat global environment. alongside russia, china has also been visibly conducting hypersonic weapons tests, leading some to raise the question as to whether the u.s. could be behind key rivals in this area.
a report in popular mechanics sites chinese state media as having announced a successful test of a new wave-rider hypersonic vehicle.
the hypersonic vehicle that detached from the booster rocket flew for 400 seconds, achieving a maximum speed of mach 5.5 to 6 (4,200 to 4,600 miles an hour) and reaching an altitude of 100,000 feet, the report says.
also, a report in the diplomat earlier this year outlines chinese df-17 hypersonic missile tests in november of last year.
in an essay from earlier this year titled hypersonic missiles: a new proliferation challenge, rand scholar richard speier further specifies the seriousness of hypersonic missile threats.
they are able to evade and conceal their precise targets from defenses until just seconds before impact. this leaves targeted states with almost no time to respond…..hypersonic missiles require a reconsideration of traditional second-strike calculations, as they have the potential to decapitate a nation's leadership before it has the opportunity to launch a counter attack, speier writes.

owning the libs doesn't mean giving them two free senate seats, trump 2020 national press secretary hogan gidley told fox & friends weekend on sunday, two days ahead of georgia's crucial runoff elections, which will decide which party controls the senate.
we have to make sure that republicans maintain control of the senate so that any radical agenda of the left can't come through and destroy this country and remake it into the image of some socialist nation, which is exactly what the democrats are pledging to do, gidley said.
both georgia senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on tuesday as sen. kelly loeffler, r-ga., faces challenger raphael warnock and sen. david perdue, r-ga., takes on jon ossoff.
both ossoff and warnock are making pledges of not just embracing and adopting the green new deal, which would destroy our economy, but also make us less secure on the global stage by relying on other nations for our energy, gidley said on sunday.
they want to open our borders. they want to make puerto rico a state, d.c. a state, pack the court, all the agenda items that have been radical from the beginning that have been exposed, they are embracing and promising to do.
he went on to say that president trump is therefore going to go and campaign in georgia on monday for the republican senators and rally his supporters and say, 'guys, we are still looking at what happened in this reelection campaign for me. don't worry about that. what you need to make sure you do and focus on is getting out the vote for kelly loeffler and perdue to make sure we control the senate.'
i think it's a pretty good message and i think it's one that's going to work in the state of georgia, gidley continued.
when trump weighed in on the 2017 race, calling ossoff a super liberal democrat who wanted to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes, ossoff responded that the president was misinformed.
wisconsin supreme court tosses trump campaign lawsuit
i'm focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability and bipartisan problem solving to washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro atlanta's economy into the silicon valley of the south, ossoff said.
ossoff distanced himself from the national democratic party's lurch to the left at the time. the atlanta journal-constitution said ossoff often tried to avoid nationalizing that campaign over fears of losing moderate voters.
he said he would not support any tax increases, even on the wealthy. i don't support any increase in income tax rates, he said.
last month, loeffler painted her jan. 5 runoff election against warnock as a battle against socialism during an interview on fox news' sunday morning futures.
loeffler tied her opponent to ideas touted by the more progressive wing of the democratic party, including cutting funding to police departments and the so-called green new deal. she also linked warnock to former cuban strongman fidel castro.
in 1995, warnock was a youth pastor at abyssinian baptist church in harlem, where castro gave a speech during a trip to the united states to attend the united nations general assembly. warnock's campaign claims he had no role in the decision to host castro.
on sunday, loeffler also warned that democratic victories in her state's runoff elections will mean a radical agenda that will drastically change life in the u.s.

not everyone in houston seems to be happy with the texans decision to name longtime new england patriots executive nick caserio as new general manager.
multiple reports on tuesday confirmed that the texans had reached an agreement to name caserio to the position after previously firing bill o'brien in october.
texans hire longtime patriots executive nick caserio as new general manager: report
the move seemed welcomed by all, especially as it was houston's second attempt at locking down caserio but just hours after news broke, texans quarterback deshaun watson sent out a cryptic tweet that seemed to express disappointment with the organization's decision.

if watson was talking about caserio, it's clear he doesn't believe that ties to the patriots are the answers to houston's problems.

the early days of 2019 have not treated president trump well.
the federal government is nearing the second week of the partial shutdown, republicans are about to lose their unified government, and americans are increasingly turning against the president.
in a poll released last week by reuters/ipsos, 47 percent of americans blame president trump, over the democrats, for the shutdown. with frustrations increasing, and democratic energy at an all-time high after the historic midterm election results, the president has been backed into a corner.
click here to read more from doug schoen: trump is to blame for government shutdown, but border security is important
the democrats, who will regain the majority in the house of representatives on january 3, have already begun planning how they will come out of this issue on top.
recognizing the importance of reopening the government, they have now proposed a plan that would deal with six out of the seven appropriations bills, leaving only the department of homeland security with a continuing resolution.
as of now, this looks like the best option. however, it looks like this still will not be enough for president trump.
president trump is still demanding that the democrats provide the full $5 billion he has requested to build a wall, something that democrat leaders are refusing to provide. the presumptive speaker of the house, nancy pelosi, and senate minority leader, chuck schumer, have agreed to provide $1.3 billion for additional border security.
if i could speak directly to the president i would say to him, mr. president: take their deal.
as americans have become increasingly frustrated with the government over the shutdown, and eyes are turning toward president trump as the main person to blame, it is more important now than ever before that he take this deal and declare victory for additional border security.
the president should also take this deal because it is becoming increasingly obvious that the issue of the wall is no longer a selling point for voters. yes, there is the need for additional border security, but the issue of building the wall only motivates the president's base. and that base is growing increasingly narrow as the president's approval rating, according to the realclearpolitics, is now below 43 percent. playing to the base is an increasingly bad strategy for him going into 2020.
election results from the 2018 midterm elections should be a warning for republicans: if they want to win in 2020 they will need to back away from the hardline issues like building a wall that are clearly not working.
despite the inability to find common ground to end this shutdown, there is still a great deal of work to be done in washington.
the democratic wins across the country in the 2018 midterm elections made one thing abundantly clear: americans want action on the most pressing issues. we must shift the focus of the debate not just to keeping the government open, but fixing issues with infrastructure, health care, and, dare i say, comprehensive immigration reform.
while it might appear outlandish that in this current government there could be something like bipartisan reform, the recent criminal justice reform bill shows that common ground can still be found.
the democrats are in the best position to bring about change because of decisive victories in traditionally red states and districts that make it increasingly clear that the republican agenda is not resonating with voters.

additionally, with democrats now about to take control of the house of representatives, cooperation with them is going to be more important than ever for republican leaders.
for president trump, the solution is simple. take the $1.3 billion and call it a victory for border security. bipartisanship is going to be increasingly important in 2019, and if president trump fails to deliver, it leaves the door wide open for the democrats in 2020.

u.s. companies that operate in china, including google and starbucks, have begun closing some locations due to the outbreak. airlines, including british airways and american airlines, have grounded los angeles flights to and from shanghai and beijing.
following the interview, the world health organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in china as a global emergency.
and in a statement to fox business, a commerce department spokesperson added:
as secretary ross made clear the first step is to bring the virus under control and help the victims of this disease. it is also important to consider the ramifications of doing business with a country that has a long history of covering up real risks to its own people and the rest of the world. fortunately, the department of commerce is equipped to support the american people and our businesses to do both.

bryan cranston defended playing a quadriplegic in his upcoming movie the upside, saying taking on the role was a business decision amid the growing debate about expanding casting in hollywood.
cranston told the press association that he's aware of the need to expand opportunities to others when it comes to casting specific roles, but as an actor, he has the right to take on characters with different attributes and abilities. in the upside, cranston plays a wealthy quadriplegic who hires a caretaker, played by kevin hart, to help him on his daily routine.
we live in the world of criticism, if we're willing to get up and try something, we have to also be willing to take criticism, cranston said, according to sky news. we're very aware of the need to expand the opportunities for people with disabilities.

i don't know, where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that? i think it is worthy for debate to discuss those issues, he continued.
some social media users previously questioned cranston being cast for the role.
are disabled actors....not a thing? like, you couldn't find one? no disrespect to bryan cranston, only the chuckleheads who cast it, someone tweeted, while another person said, disabled actors whose names will get people in seats pretty much aren't a thing, unfortunately. i'm not taking a side on if it's right, but the studios want money.
several actors, including tilda swinton and jack whitehall, have received backlash in recent years for taking on movie roles that some argued could have gone to lgbtq or minority actors.
scarlett johansson was criticized in 2017 when she was cast as the lead in ghost in the shell, a remake of a japanese anime classic. many people argued the role should have been given to an asian actor.

johansson also pulled out of playing a transgender character in the film rub and tug after the lgbtq community slammed the project for not giving the opportunity to a trans actor.
glee star darren criss said last month he will no longer play a gay character because he wanted to make sure i won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role. on sunday, criss won a golden globe for playing andrew cunanan, a gay serial killer, in the show, american crime story: the assassination of gianni versace.
west virginia coach neal brown knew he would use reserve quarterback austin kendall in the second half. the redshirt senior ended up leading the moutaineers to a liberty bowl victory.
kendall threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to t.j. simmons with 5:10 left, and west virginia held off army 24-21 on thursday.
brown said the decision to switch quarterbacks was made at halftime by the mountaineers coaching staff after starter jarret doege struggled, particularly in the second quarter.

jarret has played very, very well all year, but for whatever reason, he didn't see it well, brown said, adding: i thought (kendall) came in in relief and did a nice job.
army (9-3) had a chance to tie it with 1:50 left, but quinn maretzki's 39-yard field goal was wide left. josh chandler ended army's final possession with an interception and led the mountaineers (6-4) with 13 tackles.
simmons also scored on a 5-yard pass from doege.
army quarterback tyhier tyler had three rushing touchdowns — from 1, 6, and 2 yards — to tie a liberty bowl record.
you can't do anything without the offensive line, the slotbacks and the fullbacks, tyler said. they pave the way, and i just follow.
the black knights initially were scheduled to play in the independence bowl but seemed left out of the bowl lineup after the shreveport, louisiana, bowl was canceled. they got the opportunity to play in the liberty bowl after tennessee (3-7) opted out because of covid-19 cases.
the game was played in overcast conditions with occasional showers and sub-40-degree temperatures. the weather and local covid-19 restrictions limited the crowd in the 60,000-seat liberty bowl memorial stadium, leaving clusters of the announced 8,187 fans scattered throughout the stadium.
both team controlled the other's offense through much of the first half. army coach jeff monken noted that his team, one of the best rushing teams in the country, was limited to 83 total yards by halftime.
west virginia just whipped blocks, they beat blocks, monken said. (they) got themselves where they needed to be to make the play. and they did that a lot.
what began as a defensive battle, changed after halftime. army's rushing offense got untracked, while a change in quarterbacks to kendall for west virginia gave it more firepower through the air.
i thought this game kind of mirrored 2020 in a lot of ways, brown said. a fitting way to close out the year. it wasn't a thing of beauty, but it was gritty.
army: the black knights' vaunted rushing offense couldn't move early, not picking up their initial first down until the final play of the opening quarter. eventually, they had some success attacking the perimeter of the west virginia defense.
west virginia: while the defense controlled things early, the mountaineers couldn't capitalize enough to build a significant lead. turnovers hurt west virginia, especially doege's fumble deep in his own territory late in the first half, giving army a lead. kendall taking over at quarterback made a difference as he threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in the second half.
army was down eight players who did not dress for the game, many of them key parts of the team, because of health and safety protocol.
i don't know if it changed, monken said. obviously, when you have players that are a big part of your offense and defense, kicking game included, it changes you some.
the loss snapped the black knights three-game winning streak. the most painful aspect is just not being finish it, linebacker arik smith said. being that close and not being able to finish it. but we will regroup and do this again, and we will win.
army: the black knights , who ended the regular season on a three-game winning streak, will try and continue its winning ways. there are 17 seniors listed on the army roster, but four of the five offensive line starters are seniors.
west virginia: while the mountaineers lost four games during the regular season, three of those were to teams nationally ranked at the time. with key offensive players such as doege and leading rusher leddie brown with another years of eligibility along with a young corps of receivers, the mountaineers have a nice future on offense.
former georgia state rep. vernon jones announced wednesday that he will be joining the republican party.
jones, a former democrat representing the 91st district in lithonia, ga., said in a post on twitter: now more than ever, the republican party is in desperate need of leaders that know how to fight. i know how to fight.
mitch mcconnell to rebuke gop challenge to certify electoral college vote
jones caused a stir last year when he decided to resign from his position in the state's house of representatives and commit to campaigning on behalf of president trump, even speaking at the republican nationals convention in august. he later flip-flopped on his decision to step down, saying he would not kowtow to democrats, but said he was not interested in changing parties.
jones did not respond to fox news' request for comment on what swayed him to change his mind.
5 takeaways from georgia senate runoffs
he has repeatedly accused democrats and their supporters of being thugs, calling them a left-wing mob. jones has also blamed criticism from his party for supporting trump on the fact that he is african american.
meanwhile, georgia democrat rev. raphael warnock made history tuesday night after becoming the first black senator in his state.

jones' party swap comes on the same day congress is slated to hold what is sure to be a contentious joint session to certify the results of the presidential election, which trump and his supporters have maintained was rigged despite no evidence to support his claims. several republican members of congress have pledged to vote against certifying the election for president-elect joe biden.
rep.-elect lauren boebert, r-colo., wrote a letter to house leadership friday, urging them to keep a 1967 rule that exempts lawmakers from a ban on firearms inside the capitol building.
the letter, which was signed by 82 other current and incoming gop congress members -- including dan crenshaw, mo brooks, louie gohmert and matt gaetz -- came three days after 21 democratic lawmakers asked house speaker nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy to change the 53-year-old rule to keep boebert from carrying her gun into work.
on saturday, it appeared boebert scored a victory, as new rules unveiled by house speaker nancy pelosi did not appear to include a democrat-proposed ban on firearms in the capitol.
i refuse to give up my second amendment rights, boebert said in a statement last week. i'm a 5-foot tall, 100-pound mom with four children and will be walking to work and serving in one of the most dangerous cities in the u.s. i choose to defend my family and my life with all of the force the constitution provides. i will not let a bunch of gun-grabbing house democrats take away my constitutional right to protect myself.
the letter sent by democrats said allowing lawmakers to carry guns in the capitol creates needless risk for members of congress, their staff, members of the capitol police, and visitors to the capitol grounds.
rep.-elect lauren boebert blasts democrats for trying to ban her from carrying gun at capitol
the democratic letter was led by reps. jared huffman, robin kelly and jackie speier. (speier, of california, survived five gunshot wounds suffered during the jonestown massacre in guyana in 1978.)
fellow colorado rep. jason crow, a democrat, accused boebert of conducting a political stunt and disrespecting capitol police.
the us [capitol police] are professionals & i have rarely felt safer, he tweeted. i should know. i've carried a gun for work. if boebert wants to talk safety, i have legislation to discuss.

boebert, who is an outspoken advocate for the second amendment, also said thursday she plans to join the house freedom caucus once she's sworn into office. the conservative caucus is currently led by gop rep. andy biggs of arizona and was previously led by white house chief of staff mark meadows when he was a congressman from north carolina.
before he begins a three-year prison sentence for lying to the internal revue services about the taxes he owed, lying to financial institutions and lying to congress, michael cohen – president trump's former personal attorney – is scheduled to testify about trump at a congressional hearing feb. 7.
anti-trump democrats and others who hate the president are sure to love cohen's testimony. while cohen said in 2017 that he would take a bullet to protect trump, that turned out to be yet another lie.
it turns out cohen secretly recorded phone calls with trump – hardly ethical behavior for a lawyer dealing with a client. and he has spent over 70 hours talking with federal prosecutors in new york city and from the office of special counsel robert mueller about his own crimes and making allegations of wrongdoing by president trump.
hans von spakovsky: former election commissioner: cohen and trump didn't violate campaign finance law
trump opponents can be sure that if cohen goes ahead with plans to testify before the house oversight and reform committee his words will be music to their ears.
once demonized by the anti-trump crowd, cohen has since been embraced by many of his former critics for turning on his former boss, who provided him with a paycheck for 12 years until they parted ways last year.
but with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word cohen says regarding trump or anything else?
rep. elijah cummings, d-md., will preside over the hearing where cohen testifies. now that democrats are the majority party in the house, they have promised to aggressively investigate the president's activities in the private sector, in his personal life and in government.
cohen himself issued an unintentionally ironic statement about his upcoming testimony, blithely asserting that he looked forward to having a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.
this from a man already convicted of lying to congress – among other felonies.
can we really expect a full and credible account from michael cohen? or will his testimony be just another piece in what acting u.s. attorney robert khuzami of the southern district of new york called cohen's pattern of deception, designed to make himself look good and to shift blame for his misdeeds onto the president?
khuzami has described cohen as someone who repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends. cohen's illegal conduct was marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life and he engaged in extensive, deliberate, and serious criminal conduct, according to khuzami
but with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word cohen says regarding trump or anything else?
cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to willful tax evasion, false statements to financial institutions, illegal campaign contributions, and making false statements to congress. khuzami noted that all of the crimes bore a common set of characteristics. each involved deception that was motivated by personal greed and ambition.
in his testimony scheduled for feb. 7, cohen will swear an oath to tell the truth. but he previously swore – falsely and repeatedly – that the tax returns he submitted to the irs were true and accurate.
khuzami faulted cohen for his submissions to prosecutors in which cohen repeatedly attempted to minimize the seriousness of his decision not to report millions of dollars of income over a period of years by blaming his accountant – assertions that prosecutors said are simply false.
do we have any reason to expect cohen to change his stripes when he comes before congress next month?
cohen didn't lie to just the irs and prosecutors. khuzami's sentencing memorandum noted that cohen told numerous financial institutions a long-series of self-serving lies about his assets and liabilities.
well, at least cohen's behavior is consistent!
cohen previously lied to congress about a real estate deal in russia that the trump organization had been negotiating for 30 years. nothing about the deal itself was unlawful, but cohen's ham-handed lies seemed intended to minimize the fact that he was still discussing this deal during the first half of 2016.
now that the house oversight committee is run by democrats, cohen has every incentive to shift the blame for this potentially embarrassing deal to president trump. he probably has little fear that democrats would want to see him prosecuted for misrepresenting what happened – as long as it advances their narrative that donald trump is guilty of something.
this is because congressional democrats aren't really interested in michael cohen. they're interested in using michael cohen to make accusations of wrongdoing against president trump.
there's no doubt that cohen will be asked about the hush-money payments he made to two women in exchange for not making public their unproven allegations – denied by trump – of extramarital affairs that supposedly occurred many years before trump ran for president.
cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws by making these payments. but as i have explained before, many campaign finance experts and former members of the federal election commission do not believe that the payments actually broke any federal law. as a former member of the federal elections commission and an attorney who has worked extensively on election law issues i share this view.
yet even in arranging the payments to the two women, the sentencing memorandum notes, cohen used sophisticated tactics to conceal his misconduct. and when news stories about the payments began to surface, the memorandum says cohen responded by telling shifting and misleading stories.
if members of the house oversight committee want to know why michael cohen has embraced a pattern of deception they should be sure to read the last part of the sentencing memorandum. khuzami says cohen's behavior was driven by his own ambition and greed.
originally, cohen expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new (trump) administration, according to the memorandum. when that didn't materialize, he successfully convinced numerous major corporations to retain him as a 'consultant' who could provide unique insights about and access to the new administration.
that turned out to be a lie as well. khuzami notes that although cohen made more than $4 million as a consultant, he provided little or no real services.
the sentencing memorandum adds this kicker: cohen undertook similar acts of deception in his private life.
khuzami summed it up this way: cohen's consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting … his remorse is minimal, and … his instinct to blame others is strong.

and this is the witness chairman cummings can't wait to put on national television, so millions of americans can hear him attack the president of the united states.
cohen has zero credibility. anything he says – under oath or in casual conversation – should be treated with extreme skepticism, at best.

the man who killed officer natalie corona in an ambush-style attack left a note in the apartment where he killed himself, claiming that police had targeted him with ultra sonic waves meant to keep dogs from barking.
the note left by kevin douglas limbaugh of davis, calif., was released after davis police identified the 48-year-old as the man who fatally shot corona during the officer's response to a car collision thursday night.
cop died in 'ambush' by bike-riding gunman who continued to fire shots, police chief says
the davis police department has been hitting me with ultra sonic waves meant to keep dogs from barking, reads the note, which was typed on a computer. i notified the press, internal affairs, and even the fbi about it. i am highly sensitive to its affect (sic) on my inner ear. i did my best to appease them, but they have continued for years and i can't live this way anymore.
there's no way to know when the note was typed, davis police lt. paul doroshov told sfgate.com, adding that the note was found during a search of limbaugh's apartment.
authorities id suspect in shooting death of california cop
there have been a lot of rumors as to why this happened, why he did what he did, and we're hoping this sheds some light, doroshov said. as for the placement of the note, which was found face-up on limbaugh's bed, i really can't speculate as to why it was there like that.
in addition to the note, officers found two semiautomatic handguns inside the house, a 9 mm and a .45-caliber, doroshov told the sacramento bee.
according to authorities, limbaugh rode up on a bicycle and shot and killed corona as the rookie cop was on the scene of a three-car collision. he then unleashed a barrage of bullets that struck a bus, firetruck and a young woman's backpack. the woman with the backpack was uninjured.
he then fled to a rental home he shared with a roommate. at one point, limbaugh emerged from the home wearing a bulletproof vest and yelled at the officers before going back inside. he emerged a second time with a gun before retreating.
officers killed in the line of duty in 2018
the officers never fired at him.
after hearing a single gunshot inside, the officers sent a robot where limbaugh was found to have fatally shot himself in the head.
the shooting wasn't limbaugh's first brush with the law. the sacramento bee reported he was charged and convicted on a battery case last fall in which he assaulted a co-worker in the face after a dispute. as part of that case, limbaugh was ordered to surrender an ar-15 rifle, the report said.

more than 1,000 mourners attended a saturday evening vigil for corona. the event was filled with speeches by local politicians and musical performances, according to the bee.

The best solution for Los Angeles in this strike would be to emulate New Orleans, which when its public school system failed, decided to convert all its schools to charters.

There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal.

While the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets.

In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools. The problem isn't money; it's government incompetence.

need evidence? look no further than the drama over the covid-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the gop still blocked it. they can't even work together with democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.
he evidently decided [that] they and their members (who are after all very smart and capable organizations) were better prepared to handle this job than city and county officials. the city's website rollout is probably the kind of thing he was worried about. but hospitals can't do everything. they have no particular experience of running mass vaccinations.

neighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.

candidate trips fire alarm fleeing press
president obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that congress failed to act. no, mr. president, congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.
but the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. he wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. he well knows he is exceeding his power. in 2011, he said, i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the (immigration) on my own. but that's not how our system works. that's not how our democracy functions. that's not how our constitution is written. he was right. it was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.
however, president obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. it has become his political gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with congress. he contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. he treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

thus, the sheer mind-blowing stupidity of the buffoons who stormed the capitol. they attacked congress exactly as it was doing precisely what these people wanted done. this would be akin to antifa breaking through the windows of the capitol just as a democratic u.s. senate voted on final passage of vermont socialist sen. bernie sanders' medicare-for-all legislation.

by contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

it is true that president ronald reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. but his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law congress had already passed. his exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, president george h. w. bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by congress. the point is instructive. the actions by reagan and bush are not a supporting precedent for mr. obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

president obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. article ii, section 3 requires that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. he cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. to infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. president obama admitted as much when he said, the fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that i have to enforce. he was specifically talking about immigration laws.
she said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. on wednesday, murkowski said she was offended when democratic impeachment manager jerry nadler, d-n.y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from chief justice john roberts.

in 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

'we're going to continue to take steps like that to mitigate the impact,' vice president mike pence said of the tax refunds.

president obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.
there is a difference. a determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. this is how the framers constructed our system of government. congress considers and debates a great many bills. not all of them pass. this is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. it constitutes a prudent and calculated process.

as biden said: it ain't over man, we're just getting started.
turley: oh, this would be unprecedented and i think it would be an unprecedented threat to the balance of powers within our system.
furthermore, history has repeatedly shown that government can't fix many of our most complex societal issues, even when it socializes just one part of the economy. for example, since the obamacare health insurance exchanges first opened, insurance premiums have doubled and deductibles have skyrocketed.
schilling: right, and i asked you that question because i wanted that answer but i also -- there's been -- our kids are miss-taught or are not taught the true history of this country and it's just -- i think it's damning to the education system, but the kkk was borne out of the end of the civil war because it was a way for the democrats to -- even those amendments were in play, we can make them fear us enough to keep them away from the polls and all the other stuff.
moments later another of the protesters - a young woman - asked what biden would do to close a coal fired plan in new hampshire.
trump also claims to believe in the first amendment, yet demonizes the media on an almost daily basis as enemies of the people, calls any media report that do not make him look good fake news, and has halted white house daily press briefings.
levin: one behind on third and you routinely and it's not that long ago you routinely pitch past six and seven innings which really isn't done anymore. this is a tremendous record.
levin: curt schilling, as a broadcaster -- radio, tv, digital tv -- i actually find sports broadcasters to be even more liberal than the so- called mainstream media and they like to talk about politics all the time.
among the top five candidates in the new hampshire democratic primary, sanders and warren competed in the progressive lane, together getting just over 35 percent of the vote.

president trump, speaking at a fox news town hall in joe biden's hometown of scranton, pa., on thursday evening, openly suggested that the new democratic front-runner's repeated gaffes could be a sign of a competency issue -- honing a line of attack that republicans are expected to repeatedly deploy if biden becomes his party's nominee.

in an august 2018 gallup poll, 51 percent of young people aged 18-29 said they have a favorable opinion of socialism, compared to just 45 percent who said they view capitalism positively. compare that to 2010, when 68 percent of young people said they view capitalism favorably. that's a remarkable 33 percent decline in just eight years.
schilling: he was like 79 years old when he threw that.
levin: curt schilling, were you always a republican?
biden promises to preserve private insurance and create a public option as a means of stoking competition in the insurance market. that may seem like a safer political bet for democrats who need the votes of suburban moderates to retake the white house.
levin: well one of the things we'll be able to get is in that chair, i hope general flynn, who will for once be able to tell his side of the story. people don't understand that when a prosecutor is holding a legal gun to your head, you're not allowed to speak ...
i think he's getting advice from the people in -- his inner circle is smaller than any president in our lifetime.
schilling: yes, i think they would. first of all, you can't be a sovereign nation without borders. i mean that's just a simple fact. but i've got to tell you, on the foreign policy side, i think, i was struck by a couple of things.
entrepreneur andrew yang and sen. michael bennet of colorado dropped out of the race for the democratic presidential nomination, but nine candidates remain in a field that once had over two dozen presidential hopefuls.
according to the times, the decision to delay the cap on costs was made because many employers said they needed to upgrade their computer systems. the issue was they used different systems to administer both medical coverage and drug coverage, and they were not set up to aggregate all the money an individual spends out of pocket.
the hill reported that it had reviewed emails which showed twitter saying: our site integrity team has reviewed against the synthetic and manipulated media policy and determined it does not qualify for a label at this time.

in socialism, individual rights are mere illusions. even free-speech rights are limited if they are deemed harmful to the rest of society – which means these rights don't really exist at all. this is why human rights abuses are so common in countries that try to enact socialism.

trump made a mistake in attacking something most voters care about. the president attacked the democrats on health care – but that issue helped democrats win elections in 2018, especially moderate democrats in red districts that trump won in 2016.
governors clamor for more federal controls - fox news: despite pleas from governors, members of congress and presidential candidates, president trump so far has resisted using his powers under the defense production act as officials look to ramp up the american medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. on wednesday, trump invoked the defense production act… but as of friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting wednesday that he only signed the act 'should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. hopefully there will be no need....' that has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (ppe) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. a potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple tv medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals.
responding to the threatening statements directed at associate justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on wednesday by sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., trump said the comments amounted to a call for physical violence.

when you hear that from officials, they have no plan, and they have no plan because they're afraid of being wrong and they're afraid of being wrong because they care more about getting re-elected than they care about our children's futures, he explained. that's wrong. they should be accountable.
polling in iowa, where democrats held their caucuses monday, showed that health care is the no. 1 issue among democratic voters – and polls show that health care is also a major concern for independents and republicans.

newman challenged lipinski in 2018 and was edged out in a close primary race, but this time she managed to narrowly defeat the incumbent congressman, who has represented illinois' third district since 2005.
everyone knows that pelosi – who was first elected to the house in 1987 – is an old-school machine democrat who rules from the top down with an iron fist. she recently warned vulnerable freshmen in her caucus who were voting with republicans that this is not a day at the beach. this is the congress of the united states.

make no mistake, our education system was far from perfect before the pandemic in places like detroit, he added. the literacy level was far below, far below the national average. in fact, our state had to settle with former students who believe and i agree, that literacy is a basic civil right. i believe that a quality education means a basic civil right and anyone who stands in the way of that should be held accountable.
the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary are important because they are the first two nominating contests. but the two states have small populations with few african-american and hispanic voters. the next two nominating contests – in nevada feb. 22 and south carolina feb. 29 – are in states with much more diverse populations, where biden, in particular, has enjoyed strong support.

all the king's men by robert penn warren (1946) - you know the king in this novel, willie stark, better as his real-world inspiration, louisiana's dictatorial governor of the 1930s, huey long. warren's writing is so good and his characters so real that you will practically smell the acrid cigar smoke and whiskey in the back room of slade's pool hall. if you never read it -- or never gave it a chance as required reading in school -- you owe it to yourself.

the delay opened the door to more criticism from republicans who say the law is not ready for prime-time -- and ultimately want it repealed anyway.
they say they -- and lindsey graham was right. i think lindsey graham justified his political life in the statement he made at the end of that.
nearly 40 percent of voters who said health care was their top issue voted for biden, while just 30 percent of those voters went to sanders.
the win all but assures that newman, 55, will take over the seat that lipinski's father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot.
the senate will then vote to adopt the resolution. budget reconciliations require only a simple majority to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes needed for most legislation. democrats hold a majoriy in the house. the senate is even, but democrats have an effective majority because vice president kamala harris has the tie-breaking vote.
remember that obamacare was to be paid for in part by a 40 percent tax on so-called cadillac plans – the high-end plans that unions enjoy. that tax was delayed twice by congress and finally repealed, so intense was the opposition from big labor.
schilling: well i think because --
the decision raises concerns that, at least for next year, the health care law will not save people as much money as president obama claimed. on the campaign trail, obama has touted caps on out-of-pocket costs as a selling point.
biden then used some of his most muscular language to date to criticize buttigieg, who's narrowly leading sanders in iowa as the results trickle in.
but the public option is just single-payer in slow motion. it envisions paying doctors and hospitals rates similar to medicare's, which are about 40 percent less than those for private insurance.

in the case of the trump impeachment question, pelosi has it all gamed out in advance and this most recent misleading statement is just part one.
when sanders attacks me for having baggage, i have to tell you the 60-plus candidates that i campaigned for, the toughest districts in the country just two years ago, don't see me as baggage and they wanted me in their districts, he said.
sanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.
justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, whom trump nominated to the high court, joined that decision. it was issued before trump's third nominee, justice amy coney barrett, replaced the late justice ruth bader ginsburg on the court.
bloomy transfers $18 million from campaign to dnc - politico: mike bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the democratic national committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. the money will support the dnc's 'battleground build-up 2020' program, the dnc's initiative in 12 swing states across the country. the money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. 'this will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help democrats win up and down the ballot,' dnc chairman tom perez said in a statement. 'the dnc has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure donald trump is a one-term president.' the massive transfer signals a change of plans for bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super pac to take on president donald trump in 2020.

wapo: sen. richard burr (r-n.c.) said friday that he has asked the senate ethics committee to review his recent stock sales, which included some in industries that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak. the senate intelligence committee chairman, who had expressed confidence in the country's preparedness for the pandemic, sold a significant share of his stocks last month, according to public disclosures. burr said he relied solely on public news reports for the sales but asked senate ethics chairman james lankford (r-okla.) for a review. 'understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, i spoke this morning with the chairman of the senate ethics committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,' burr said in a statement. the sales included stocks in hotels and restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. in his statement, burr said he had relied specifically on 'cnbc's daily health and science reporting out of its asia bureaus.'
sen. john barrasso, r-wyo., pointed to the delay in reviving his call to start over on the law.

when one of them continued to interupt biden, he responded saying don't act like the trumpers, ok.
the reason this law keeps getting delayed is because it doesn't work like the president promised it would work, he said in a statement.
the former vice president then emphasized that president trump is champing at the bit to label the democrats as socialists. and he pointed to his own efforts in the 2018 midterms in helping the democrats win back the majority of the house of representatives.
the law, commonly known as obamacare, was first upheld by the supreme court under the justification that by tying the individual mandate -- the requirement to buy health insurance -- to a financial penalty it fell under congress' taxation power. when president trump eliminated the penalty, republican-led states claimed there was no longer a legal basis for the mandate.
one longtime consultant for the democrats, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, also pointed to bloomberg's lack of charisma.
levin: quasi sidearm, i go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
levin: and i have this question for you. when bernie sanders talks about government, when elizabeth warren talks about government, when all of these people talk about government, can they give us some names? in other words, exactly who's going to the healthcare system? and exactly where do these experts come from? they're not experts. they're people who are in the bureaucracy. they are civil servants. they're members of unions in some cases, some of them have seniority. do they have expert tests?
i never rule things out because you never know what life brings, he told cnn. but i'm focused on the work i'm doing now and getting this message out.

medicare-for-all may play well in the democratic primaries. but it will be disastrous in a general election.
this is a democratic district. let's have a real democrat fighting for us, newman tweeted monday, including infographics showing how lipinski's past votes against obamacare and for restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions.
folks: this is simple. there are a great many longtime democrats living in toss-up states who didn't like the direction that president obama took the country. those voters, many of them union members, decided to take a flyer on neophyte candidate donald trump. why? because he talked about things that mattered to them – like jobs and manufacturing and trade deals. he also appealed to their patriotism and common sense, like putting america first.
schilling: i think i was. i registered and when i registered in 18, i registered as an independent and i think i was -- and i think to this day, i'm probably more an independent republican because i think socially, i'm very progressive, but fiscally i'm not.
levin: do they view us as part of a global community?
trump later noted that he has always disliked the concept of shaking hands: if there was ever a time you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it, he mused, before lamenting that politicians unfortunately are required to shake some hands.

talking about the dangers of socialism with kids isn't easy. children are constantly being bombarded with pro-socialist messages from hollywood, the music industry, professional sports and, most importantly, their teachers and professors.
in a significant defeat for former president donald trump, the supreme court on monday declined to step in to halt the turnover of his tax records to a new york prosecutor.
levin: so how does somebody get on the ballot?
kelly: right. this isn't about how you feel about what should be done about the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country. you can very much want a path to legalization for them. you could be behind the president's, you know, original plan submitted to congress that was passed by the senate. what this is about is what a president gets to do when an elected branch says, no to his agenda. and the framers decided that a long time ago.
what the president's suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution. we have a separation of powers that gives us balance. and that doesn't protect the branches. it's not there to protect the executive branch or legislative branch. it's to protect liberty. it's to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty. and i'm afraid -- go ahead. i'm sorry.
bernie sanders would have won five, six, seven states, trump remarked. when you look at it, she did him no favors. that was not a good friendship. we started to see that during the debates, by the way. it became unhinged.
levin: but that means -- so you go on automatically?
the former vice president then took another shot, saying i've great respect for mayor pete and his service to this nation but i believe it's a risk – to be straight up with you – for this party to nominate someone who's never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 in indiana. i do believe it's a risk.
could the problem be that for progressivism, witting or unwitting, whatever the format is, whatever the forum is. sports -- we're going to devour it with our ideology. that's my sense of this. whatever is out there, we have got to superimpose and project our ideology.
i understood his philosophy. he had no animus whatsoever. his was a constitutional argument. that's fine. the problem i have is that the democratic party and their mouthpieces in the media keep accusing republicans of what they were.
levin: you don't think this ends well?
whenever parents discuss socialism, they should always explain that it's important to engage in charitable activities. advocates of freedom do support helping others, they just don't believe the government is best equipped to do it.
the former vice president touted his past efforts and added we can't do it all at one. we're working on it kid. we're working on it.
buttigieg, klobuchar and biden competed for the more moderate vote, and together captured almost 53 percent of the vote.
most polls – especially the most recent polls – showed sanders leading or winning in new hampshire. the polls were accurate, though buttigieg came close to scoring an upset.
right now, we are in a situation where truancy is at an all-time high, the achievement is at an all-time low. and if you can't read, you can't work, james added.
once one of these men wins the democratic nomination to run against president trump, the president will call attention to the fatal flaws in his opponent's plans. as a result, that could mean that health care will become a losing issue for democrats, unlike in the 2018 midterm elections.

private insurers don't have the power to dictate what they'll pay providers. consequently, the public option will have a much lower cost structure – and will thus be able to set premiums that are far lower than those for private insurers.
the department of health and human services seems to be caught between critics on both sides as it confronts the task.
he campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare for years and then it got to a vote and he said thumbs down, trump said.
schilling: no, because i think the republic -- most of the republicans in congress stopped representing me about seven or eight years ago and started representing themselves and running for office the day they got into office.
one of my people came up to me and said, 'mr. president, they tried to beat you on russia, russia, russia, that didn't work out too well. they couldn't do it. they tried the impeachment hoax,' that was on a perfect conversation, 'they tried anything, they tried it over and over and they've been doing it since you got in. it's all turning, they lost, it's all turning -- think of it, think of it, and this is their new hoax.'

by threatening (again) to dismantle obamacare – which millions of americans, including trump supporters, rely on it – trump could lose votes he needs to get reelected. this is not a smart move.

four: the democratic party is divided
turley, july 16: he has said that he's going to resolve the deadlock in congress, the division with congress, by ordering changes on his own terms as a majority of one. that's what makes it dangerous.
schilling: well, i think that it's a byproduct of our education system, first off. most of them have gone to college and got a degree in gender studies or whatever they get degrees in these days and that's what they do.
bonfire of the vanities by tom wolfe (1987) - we know this isn't a political book, per se. but boy is it a great insight on the way the world of politics functions. wolfe's masterwork, set in the heady days of mid-1980s manhattan, provides amazing insight on the way racial politics, media muckraking, politicians' opportunism and cultural trends shape the way we are governed.
but you game this out. trump is going win in 2020. there is just no feasible way unless the russians and democrats get together again and try and rig another election, but he wins in 2020. they're not going to suddenly scale back. they'll be apoplectic, more so than they are now.
levin: you ask me. go ahead.
the super tuesday results, trump said, had come as a surprise -- especially given what he suggested were biden's possible cognitive impairments.

since the high court's ruling, in the vance case, trump's attorneys made additional arguments that his tax records should not be turned over, but they lost again in federal court in new york and on appeal. it was those rulings that trump had sought to put on hold.
the endorsement of the three progressive freshmen congresswomen gave sanders an important boost that contributed to his new hampshire victory.

warren's poor showing in new hampshire is especially embarrassing for her because her home state of massachusetts borders new hampshire and that should have given her a geographical advantage. sanders is also from a neighboring state – vermont.
the associated press contributed to this report.
as part of its july decision, the high court returned the vance case and a similar case involving records sought by congress to lower courts. and the court prevented the records from being turned over while the cases proceeded.

just two years ago, democrats chalked their victories in the 2018 midterm elections up to their promise to protect obamacare. now they're going to run on a plan for health care reform that results in the end of private insurance.

spanish-speaking voters have played an extremely influential role in nevada's presidential caucuses, and the democrats' campaigns have been stepping up their efforts to reach the electorate, with early caucus voting underway since saturday.
bloomberg had compared trump to vader with a video from the movie star wars.
some democratic senators and house members boycotted trump's state of the union address. some – like rep tim ryan, d-ohio, walked out. he tweeted: 'i just walked out of the state of the union. i've had enough. it's like watching professional wrestling. it's all fake.
levin: so this whole notion of centralized government, of uniformity, of redistributing wealth, kind of destroys all those motivations and principles.

as a consequence of the delay, some health plans in 2014 will be able to keep separate caps for both medical care and drug plans, or have no cap at all on drug costs.
in america, we celebrate faith. we cherish religion. we lift our voices in prayer. and we raise our sights to the glory of god, the president said. those are beautiful words, but trump's actions speak louder.
schilling: yes, i -- yes, okay, that's fair.
in new hampshire, polls show 6 in 10 voters concerned about health care support a government-sponsored program like medicare-for-all.
the fellow americans ad was just the latest to pop up as the coronavirus pandemic worsens. americans for public trust, another outside nonprofit led by former nevada attorney general adam laxalt, is claiming that similar anti-trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to arabella advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. specifically, it houses the new venture fund and sixteen thirty fund, both of which have supported another democrat-aligned group -- american bridge -- that's hitting trump on the coronavirus response.
martinez, who was hospitalized while waiting for the insurance issues to sort out, fears he could be stuck with a $12,000 medical bill for his stay.

schilling: it's a pleasure. it's always a pleasure.
schilling: there are some french -- yes, there are some french, absolutely. absolutely, but when you go to the graveyard above normandy beach above utah beach and you look at the rows and the rows and the rows and you watch french citizens react to world war ii veterans which is one of the greatest things i've ever seen in my life, you realize that the media doesn't represent not just american interests but the common man.
partisan investigations such as these should not be treated as legitimate exercises of congressional oversight. no one should participate in these taxpayer-funded witch hunts because the final report by special counsel robert mueller will put to rest many of the questions that democrats and their associates in the mainstream media have been hyperventilating over for two years – and its answers will not fit with their false narrative.

biden admin tells supreme court obamacare is constitutional, a reversal of trump's doj stance in pending case
most democrats identify as liberals for first time, underscoring leftward tilt of party
but really, bernie is not alone. no candidate seems to be tailoring his or her message to those traditional democrats who rejected hillary clinton.
polling showed that new hampshire democratic voters are angry and want the democratic party to nominate a candidate who can defeat president trump in november.
the capitalism weeds out the weak and it's why we are where we are, but i think i entrenched my stance as a conservative when i when i was old enough to read and understand the constitution. i think i was like 11 and --
and so you know, you look at a generation. my kids are between 16 and 22, so they're in college and they're pretty conservative and they're listening to liberal professors say things and they'll text me and the only -- my son has one professor who said, i don't want you to take what i say at face value. i want you to challenge me. which is the first time you ever heard anybody left-of-center say that.
the court's action is the apparent culmination of a lengthy legal battle that had already reached the high court once before.
biden then highlighted numerous other accomplishments during the obama years and asked is he really saying that the obama-biden administration was a failure? pete, just say it out loud.
bloomberg – spending record amounts of his multibillion-dollar fortune on his campaign – wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire but is campaigning and advertising heavily in super tuesday states.
but the approach taken by bernie and other progressives was so extreme – demanding the end of private insurance – that, rather than galvanizing support for democrats, it fractured the party. astonishingly, the candidates who jumped aboard single-payer health care never stopped to think about how their plan would impact union workers, who would be the group most opposed to ending private insurance.
the only lawmaker in new hampshire's four-member all democratic congressional delegation said have tremendous respect for the vice president. but i've got to tell you, it's a risk to go after this campaign with the same message, the same ideas, the same issues that we've been litigating. i think we need new energy, i think we need a new approach ... bringing people together the way pete does.
kelly: joining me now, jonathan turley, constitutional attorney and professor at george washington university. good to see you again, professor.
the town hall covered an array of other topics, including stock market turbulence and deregulation. out of the gate, trump defended his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying his decision to limit travel from china had averted a broader domestic crisis.
the new york times first reported on tuesday that the administration is giving some insurers and employers a one-year grace period to adhere to the limit, which otherwise would have capped individual costs at $6,350 a year. the full requirement will go into effect in 2015, rather than 2014. the change means some employers -- namely, those with more than one benefit provider -- could use plans with higher limits or no limit at all on out-of-pocket costs during that period.

bloomberg - regardless of whether he qualifies for the debate or not - is scheduled to in neighboring utah on thursday evening - to hold a rally in salt lake city.
there's a reason that left-wing commentator chris mathews compared sanders' win in nevada to france falling to the nazis in 1940. for democrats, it's almost that dire.
schilling: i don't think that's the sole reason. i think that that's part of it. i've seen that dynamic at work, but i do know that -- i was surprised by that by what you said. there were a lot more liberals in the booth and espn was -- i mean, i had people literally come up to me. it's almost like being a member of the underground railway, i guess.
and biden said he doubted such candidates would want bernie sanders to come in and campaign for them.
in addition, trump's state of the union address felt more like a campaign speech for someone running for reelection than a speech to democrats as well as republicans in congress. it lacked the formality, decorum and graciousness that a state of the union normally has.

and so, you have spoken out about this through president bush's years and now through president obama's years and talked about the rise of an uber presidency. is the president in your view about to violate the separation of powers if he goes ahead and does this?
schilling: no, it doesn't. it can't end well because the left has proven that they won't let it end until they get their way.
about 8 million people signed up for a health plan through the aca exchanges -- according to hhs, that meant officials had to verify more than 160 million individual pieces of information. in the end, they found 1.2 million people had inconsistencies in their applications.
over the weekend, he blasted mccain for giving to the fbi an uncorroborated dossier alleging that moscow held compromising information on trump.
bloomberg would be best served if he didn't appear on the debate stage before super tuesday, because voters won't see his bland personality and slow-to-respond debate reflexes, the strategist noted.
he gave a similar answer when asked by a voter how he would bring us together. the voter noted that a relative had banished trump supporters from the family.
in his state of the union address tuesday night, president trump tried to make it sound like everything's coming up roses for the united states – and of course, he said all the credit belongs to him. but as a democrat, i believe the state of the union is not good – our nation is divided, and there is too much hatred and too little forgiveness.
schilling: the wall is a great example. you were mentioning how much the left love trump. back when they were loving trump, they were also approving $25 billion and $40 billion to fund a wall because you can go back and look at the sound bytes of obama and clinton and everybody saying, we need this. we need border security.

de blasio's comments come as democrats already have been trending further left in policy proposals and as recent polling suggests they're responding to the wishes of the democratic base.
meanwhile, de blasio on sunday said he wouldn't rule out running for president in 2020.

jonathan turley, constitutional attorney, dec. 3, 2013: you have the rise of an uber presidency. there could be no greater danger for individual liberty. and i really think that the framers would be horrified.
if a republican did what schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, trump said to applause.
de blasio's announcement last week came after california's new democratic gov. gavin newsom outlined a similar health care agenda for his state, offering more benefits to illegal immigrants while protecting obamacare.
twitter declined thursday to flag an ad criticizing president trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic as democrat groups continue to press the issue ahead of the november election.
significantly, new polling shows former new york city mayor mike bloomberg's is picking up support among african-americans – a constituency that has been strongly supportive of biden in earlier polls.
second, with her coaching tip, pelosi was essentially instructing the anti-trump washington post to blow the statement up and make sure everyone talked about it. it's a lovely example of a liberal politician colluding with the liberal media.

schilling: as conservatives, we're up against a group of people who don't have any forethought, who don't think ahead. you can't, in any realistic scenario in the real world play out this socialist dream and come to a conclusion that benefits the people. it's never worked anywhere ever.
in 2001, i won the roberto clemente award which is still the highlight of my career. a quick story, my dad, i went to one game as a fan in my lifetime -- in my lifetime. it was roberto clemente's final game in 1972. he doubled off john madden like for his 3,000th hit and he died in the plane crash not long after.
for decades organized labor fought for the best insurance programs money could buy, and they got them. companies preferred giving out lavish health-care and pension benefits to increasing wages, which would have a more immediate impact on their bottom line.

nyt: on friday, gov. andrew m. cuomo told new york's 19 million residents to stay indoors as much as possible and ordered nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home. the measures, the state's most drastic yet, come as confirmed coronavirus cases in new york topped 7,000, by far the most in the nation. 'these provisions will be enforced,' the governor said at a briefing in albany. 'these are not helpful hints.' they will take effect sunday night. even as he told new yorkers to stay indoors, mr. cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other.
sanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.
this public support for medicare-for-all might be a function of their fuzziness on how it would work. some 47 percent of americans erroneously think they'd be able to keep their employer-sponsored insurance under medicare-for-all.

sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota came in a strong third with almost 20 percent, while sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts trailed at a distant fourth with just over 9 percent. former vice president joe biden was in fifth place with just over 8 percent. no other candidate managed to reach even 4 percent of the vote.
four weeks after he mailed his first packet, he received a letter asking for even more documents to verify his wife's immigration status.
the former vice president needs to change it up to get more people to come out and vote for him by getting them more excited about his candidacy. he can't just count on states like south carolina with large minority populations.

with wednesday's presidential primary debate in nevada fast approaching, mike bloomberg remains one poll shy of making the state.

one of those quotes includes trump's hoax comment but does so by combining two separate statements and not providing the words trump said before he used the hoax label. the coronavirus, this is their new hoax, the ad says. according to the washington post, trump never made that exact statement but it was included in another ad released by former vice president joe biden's campaign. the post also determined that trump wasn't calling the virus itself a hoax.
the president pointed to something of a silver lining in the episode: people are now staying in the united states, spending their money in the united states, and i like that. you know, i've been after that for a long time. i've been saying, let's stay in the u.s., spend your money here. it's sort of enforced doing that.

from the outset of the campaign, sanders and elizabeth warren jumped on medicare-for-all, dragging others along with them, convinced that health care was the issue that would topple republicans. ironically, they might have been right. the gop has made a total hash of overhauling obamacare and proposing a better alternative, in part thanks to the late sen. john mccain, who single-handedly undermined the party's health-care initiative.
he bought a bronze-level health plan with coventry and was asked to provide additional information to verify his income and his wife's citizenship. his monthly $457 subsidy was at risk if he didn't comply.

newsom orders california's nearly 40 millions residents to stay home - sacramento bee: all californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, gov. gavin newsom ordered thursday. 'it's time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,' he said at an evening press conference. newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging californians to influence one another to do the right thing. 'i don't believe the people of california need to be told through law enforcement to home isolate, protect themselves,' he said. more than a quarter of the state's residents were already under some type of shelter in place or stay at home orders, including in sacramento county.

mr. bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president, sanders said. but, the populist senator who's making his second straight white house run emphasized, he does not have a right to buy the presidency, especially after being mayor of new york and having a racist stop-and-frisk policy.
and so, you know, if he goes ahead and does it, i mean, obviously the next president could undo it. that might cause all sorts of logistical problems. but, what, i mean, right now senator jeff sessions, who is going to take over as the budget committee chief, says, i'm going to try to deny the funding. i'm going to try to sort of take away his ability to issue temporary worker cards to anybody. but there's been some questions about whether that could work. there's a lawsuit already pending against him. there's a question whether that is feckless. some people have talked about impeaching the president. the republicans seem to feel that's too politically dangerous. so as a practical matter, is he just probably going to get away with it?
no letup in the bloomberg-sanders war of words
a group of 20 democratic states appealed. defenders of the affordable care act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts.
these alternatives could mean moving cases to the term starting in october of this year or even resolving cases without oral arguments and just based on written briefs submitted to the court. there is no constitutional mandate that the supreme court hold in-person arguments on cases it decides.

turley: well, it's a very sad moment. but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward particularly after this election to defy the will of congress yet again. i can understand the frustration. these are obviously two parties that are not getting along. but as you said we do have a democratic process. we have a congress that is coming in with the full voice of the american people behind them. that's what an election is. now, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.

now, the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, trump told the crowd. coronavirus, they're politicizing it. we did one of the great jobs. you see, 'how's president trump doing?' they go, 'oh not good, not good.' they have no clue. they can't even count their votes in iowa -- not they can't, they can't count their votes.
levin: i'll tell you why. and it's interesting you bring this up. those amendments had to be adopted by what? the states. and it's often said, while quote-unquote states rights, i call it federalism is a problem because you look at it pre-civil war, well, it's the states that fought the states.
schilling: with no background of success in doing anything. the government is never -- that's why capitalism -- private sector has kicked the crap out of the government forever because of the competition.
it isn't just on health care that democrats have gone off the reservation. consider the candidates – bernie among them – vowing to ban fracking, and promising the end of fossil fuels. are they not aware that in critical swing states like pennsylvania and ohio thousands of workers are making lots of money working in the oilfields? that those states have hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues courtesy of oil and petrochemical development?

mcconnell sets monday deadline on stimulus deal - bloomberg: senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he wants the chamber to finish and pass a massive stimulus bill to bolster the economy by monday -- lightning speed for legislation expected to top $1 trillion. mcconnell, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived at the capitol friday morning for a blitz of bipartisan negotiations, with all sides stressing the need to act fast. 'i've tasked the bipartisan team to reach an agreement by the end of the day today,' mcconnell said at the capitol. getting a deal done friday would give bill drafters saturday to write up the text, with mcconnell planning to start the process for teeing up votes on monday. eric ueland, the white house legislative liaison, also stressed the need for speed. … he noted that mnuchin said he wants congress to complete action on the bill by monday 'to ensure that aid swiftly gets to the american people as well as to provide confidence with the american economy, and american markets.'

with this model in place, minorities don't really have any rights. if the majority thinks people should live or work in a certain way, everyone is required to obey, even if it violates their deeply held beliefs. for example, in a socialist country, vegetarians would be required to be part owners in a slaughterhouse.
levin: i also consider you one of the greatest.
schilling: i think two years ago because it went down last year.
schilling: well, here's the thing. i'm -- the second you say you're against obamacare, you're hoping people die according to the media. i want everybody to have healthcare. first of all, let's be clear.
levin: before he became a republican, before he decided to run, before he was the nominee, before he was president of the united states, the liberals loved them. the media loved him. hollywood loved him and they couldn't say enough good things about him. they took his money. they took his donations. they made money off of his program. all of that was well and good
despite mountains of historical evidence revealing the dangers associated with socialism, support for karl marx's collectivist ideas is steadily increasing.
schilling: if your foreign policy is not america first, what is it? china first? i mean, part of the reason i was so distraught over the eight years of obama is -- whoever was president this time, hopefully it was a conservative, he was going to have to unravel the kowtowing and the bending and the kissing of butt globally that the administration did, apologizing.
like i said, you can't, like the hall of fame vote stuff. i can't live my life for those people to -- because they are never going to like you. there's a certain part of the world that just doesn't like you for whatever reason. the reasons they don't like me have to do with, i think character and integrity and morals and ethics and honor and all the things that my dad taught me to believe and we were talking earlier, i said -- one of the most powerful lessons in my life was roger clemens pulling me aside and talking about --

the democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.
turley: well, it does sound like congress is going to aggressively assert its authority through legislation and other means. what congress and what the american people have to insist on from this president is a limiting principle. what the president is saying lacks a limiting principle. he's basically saying if these reports are correct that he can claim discretion to simply not enforce a federal law. well, that comes very close if doesn't cross the line of legislation. if a president can do that, as you've said, he can do that with environmental laws or anti-discrimination laws. the american people have got to force this issue and say, look, we may agree with you on what you're trying to do. but we don't agree how you're trying to do it.

these days, the costs of those health-care plans are enormous, and the coverage is excellent – far better than would be available under bernie's nationwide government-run system. union workers are not stupid; they know this would be a loss for them, and they will resist it.

for most young americans, socialist ideas are appealing because they genuinely want to help those who are suffering. they believe single-payer health care, a green new deal, and other similar policies are compassionate. conservatives have a tendency to dismiss these ideas without providing alternatives. this leaves younger people feeling frustrated.
nearly six in 10 americans say they oppose medicare-for-all if it leads to the elimination of private insurance – which it most certainly does.
levin: now, you're describing a political party that puts power before a country because why in the world would they change their position, everybody knows a nation needs to secure its border. everybody knows it's a bad thing for drugs and drug runners to come into the country. everybody knows that we need to know who's coming into this country.

wsj editorial board: rethinking the coronavirus shutdown - wsj
here are my 10 takeaways from the new hampshire democratic primary, which sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., narrowly won with almost 26 percent of the vote, followed closely by former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg in second-place with just over 24 percent, with 87 percent of precincts reporting.
so it's been a week, and you're starting to get a little bit of ranch fever. okay, maybe a lot. you're following the good advice to keep some structure in your day, especially if there are younger ones around. you're attending to your intellectual, physical and spiritual needs, getting plenty of fresh air and going to bed before 11 o'clock. but you still feel the strains of isolation and loss of routine. so read a book! not just any book, but a world-class book that will hold your attention, expand your mind and transport you to someplace else entirely. there are lots of lists of great books out there for generalists. but what about political books? glad you asked... here is the halftime report's latest and greatest list of the best political books to read:
schilling: i think nolan ryan was one of the greatest strikeout pitchers of all time. nolan ryan was a guy -- his last pitch was 95 miles an hour.
this idea is best reinforced when families engage in charitable activities together. parents must show their kids that motivated, compassionate conservatives care for those most in need and make the world a better place.
the confirmation comes weeks after the administration announced it was delaying a key insurance mandate -- the requirement on mid-sized and large businesses to provide coverage to full-time workers. the mandate, and the cap on costs, were both delayed for one year, in a move officials claimed was meant to give businesses more time to prepare.
betsy mccaughey: sanders gets it wrong on 'medicare-for-all'
growing number of 2020 democrats supporting 'green new deal'
schilling: and how is that not the story?
as for what congress can do, they have to use every resource available. you know, the president has made a mockery of the power of the purse. you can't just rely on that. it's like running a nuclear reactor with an on/off switch. it doesn't really do what people think it does. it's very hard to use appropriations to control a president who is engaging an overreach.
levin: not hegel, who would come a little later, but was somewhat of a contemporary and rousseau, who was followed by the french and then they had 10 years of terrorism and the french revolution. the reason why there had to be a civil rights movement is because there was resistance, that word, particularly in the south among the old democrats and the democratic party.
levin: so you think they're bitter because they see athletes making all this money and they make chump change -- many of them.

i want to ask you one other thing which is, what should republicans, or democrats for that matter, who object to what he is likely about to do, do in response?
new hampshire used paper ballots. the primary went off without a hitch and results came in early – quite a contrast to the failure of new technology used to tabulate votes in the iowa caucuses.
evidence from single-payer systems abroad indicates that all the gigantic tax increases needed to pay for medicare-for-all would simply buy us all places on waiting lists for health care.
levin: you have flirted with running for office. massachusetts would be a tough place to run.
he then stressed that sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.
schilling: yes, as a member of the association, so -- and you don't have to be a baseball writer.
levin: why does that offend the left?
in response to the report, an obama administration official stressed that the cap on individual spending for major medical coverage will still be in place in 2014, on time. it will then be expanded to cover other benefits the following year.
insurance companies could still raise premiums to offset some of the lost revenue from caps on out-of-pocket costs. the law, though, does aim to keep premium increases in check, and barring any other delays would still prevent health insurers from denying coverage or charging more based on pre-existing conditions.
trump went on to argue that biden was damaged by the impeachment process that implicated his son hunter in apparent overseas corruption while biden was vice president. they aimed at trump and they took biden down, the president said.
turley: well, megyn, we're waiting for the details, but what i'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate separation of powers. supreme court has already ruled that this president has violated the separation of powers. they just took another case a week ago in the aca obamacare area about whether he had another violation in that area.
explain that there's never been a successful socialist nation in world history
levin: all common sense, but they reject it. they don't reject it because it's irrational or bad policy or bad for the country. they reject it because it's bad for their own political fortunes and yet they have a propaganda machine at cnn and msnbc and in the new york times day-in day- out, you were talking about your kids. they have academia in their back pocket with tenured professors who are mostly hardcore left-wing and much like you in sports.
biden has to step up his game in the debates and reevaluate why he once topped the polls in iowa and new hampshire but then fell flat when voting was held.
the case the high court ruled in involves a grand jury subpoena for more than eight years of trump's personal and corporate tax records. vance has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records. in one court filing last year, however, prosecutors said they were justified in demanding the records because of public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the trump organization.
levin: while they hanged people. they raped people.
that's led some political pundits to surmise that bloomberg would be better off if he failed to qualify for wednesday's debate – thus avoiding direct contact with his rivals.
the court offered no explanation for the delay, and the legal issue before the justices did not involve whether trump was due any special deference because he was president.
sanders' medicare-for-all plan will require back-breaking tax hikes that will pick the pockets of every american to cover its $46 trillion cost over 10 years. by way of comparison, president trump has proposed a budget of $4.829 trillion for the entire federal government in the 2021 fiscal year.
schilling: no, not now. after i watched -- you know, when you look at what the left has done to people that they don't like especially politicians, when i watch the kavanagh hearing and realized that conservative wives, spouses and children are now in play for the media, my family doesn't deserve that. and they're not -- they spent 20 years following me around baseball. i'm not going to subject them to that.
while president trump promised to unite the nation, the truth is that he has only made america's divisions worse with his attacks on politicians, individuals and entire groups of people.
turley: well, i think that's right. and i think what i tell a lot of my friends on the democratic side is that we will rule the day that you help create this uber presidency. it's been developing a long time. but is reaching a very dangerous point. this will not be our last president. and you may not agree with the next one. but what the democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. they're creating a president who can go it alone. and to go it alone is something that is a very danger that the framers sought to avoid in our constitution.
new york city mayor bill de blasio said that moderate democrats never learned the lessons of 2016, calling for the party to embrace a bold liberal agenda in the run-up to the 2020 presidential campaign.
rest assured, coming from pelosi, her comment on impeachment was a calculated political statement all the way. pelosi was simply getting out in front of what she knows will be a horribly divisive road to impeachment – one that she will be leading.
speaking to an audience in this small southeastern new hampshire city the morning after delayed partial returns from the iowa caucuses showed biden in fourth place -- trailing buttigieg, sanders and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts -- the former vice president admitted, i'm not going to sugarcoat it. we took a gut punch in iowa.
kelly: yes. i said last night to charles krauthammer, how will they like it if they get a republican president in there who says, you know what, i don't like these laws that prevent protests outside of abortion clinics, so i'm just going to use my discretion not to pursue any prosecutions against those people. and protest against abortion clinics grow so loud and so big that nobody can go into these clinics and get an abortion, well, so be it because that's a matter of my discretion.
pelosi knows she can't be seen as following the lead of the unhinged rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich., in her quest to impeach the president, who tlaib described with an obscene term.
you have to remember that as recently as 1924, at the democratic convention at madison square garden in new york, the klan controlled the convention.

that caused sen. mitt romney, r-utah, to say he can't understand why trump would go after mccain, whom he called heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god.
somersworth, n.h. -- former vice president joe biden cranked up the volume wednesday in his attacks against two of his top rivals for the democratic presidential nomination – sen. bernie sanders of vermont and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.
then comes super tuesday on march 3, when voters in alabama, american samoa, arkansas, california, colorado, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, texas, vermont and virginia cast ballots for their choice for the democratic presidential nominee.
the two other ways to make the stage – reaching 12 percent or higher in two nevada caucus or south carolina primary-approved polls, or winning a delegate to the national convention in the feb. 3 iowa caucuses or last week's new hampshire primary – have been out of picture for bloomberg, since he's not on the ballot in any of the early-voting states.

it was important for pelosi to get her anti-impeachment claim out. she wants to be viewed as someone who isn't an overzealous supporter of the left's crazed march to impeachment.

federal travel ban expands - usa today: the u.s.-mexico border will be closed to nonessential travel to further help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, president donald trump announced friday. 'as we did with canada, we're also working with mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,' trump said. 'these new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.' trump said that mexico is also suspending air travel from europe. secretary of state mike pompeo said the u.s. has taken 'two important steps' this week to curb the spread of the virus. he noted the border closure with canada, announced wednesday, would go into effect at midnight. he said the closure would last 30 days and reiterated the news trump shared that the border with mexico would also close.

schilling: no from ground level, anyway, but roger told me when you walk out in the field, the name on the back of your jersey, that's not your name, that's your father's name and i never forgot that.
trump's tax records are not supposed to become public as part of prosecutor's criminal investigation, but the high court's action is a blow to trump because he has for so long fought on so many fronts to keep his tax records shielded from view. the ongoing investigation the records are part of could also become an issue for trump in his life after the presidency. trump has called it a fishing expedition and a continuation of the witch hunt — the greatest witch hunt in history.
schilling: so -- but i don't know, 15 years ago, i was in tampa bay and the hall of fame voting had come out and i think -- i want to say nolan ryan had gotten elected and a writer walked into the clubhouse and said -- and this guy was -- he was an ass. he was a pompous guy. he was the 500- pound guy who tells everybody he was the greatest athlete in the world when he wasn't 500 pounds.
during the campaign to date, the media has treated sanders as an entertaining oddity, and has rarely challenged him. count on that to change in coming months, as his rivals fight his ascent and president trump goes after him. film clips of sanders defending communist countries, or defending his campaign against sexism, will become more prevalent. he may still succeed in winning the nomination, but the bernie bubble will burst.
schilling: they were the terrorism arm of the democratic party. period. and you know, you have these people talking about the big switch in the sixties. there was one person that's switched and then you talk about what -- everybody that followed goldwater. goldwater --
this conversation allows parents to make a very important moral argument: charity is morally positive, because it means people are voluntarily helping those in need, but government welfare programs – however well-intentioned they might be – are not forms of charity. they require the government to use force and coercion. those who don't want to pay for a government program because they think it isn't helpful – or perhaps believe it's harmful – are forced to pay their taxes and participate anyway. those who refuse can end up in prison.
schilling: you can't be denied -- you keep walking in it -- you cannot be -- you can be denied health insurance, but you can't be denied healthcare. the fact that of the matter is, in capitalism, if we force people to -- under a single-payer government-run healthcare system, then we are going to be telling people who go to medical school to become doctors just how much money they're allowed to make every year and that's that slippery slope.

but there's also the risk of putting in so many checks that applicants, like luis martinez of hialeah, fla, get caught in bureaucratic red tape.
as he's risen in national polls the past couple of weeks and as onetime-unrivaled front-runner biden has slipped – bloomberg's come under increased fire from his rivals as well as president trump's re-campaign over past controversial comments in support of the stop-and-frisk policing he once oversaw during his tenure as new york city mayor. and, he's also taken hits as more and more past remarks deemed sexist have been unearthed.
i want to know why we had to have a civil rights movement in 1960 to give minorities the rights that they were given in 1870?
the court's order is a win for manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr., who has been seeking trump's tax records since 2019 as part of an investigation. vance, a democrat, had subpoenaed the records from the mazars accounting firm that has long done work for trump and his businesses. mazars has said it would comply with the subpoena, but trump, a republican, sued to block the records' release.
levin: i want to ask you this, i don't want the public to know this. you haven't complained about this to me at all. i'm the one who keeps bringing it up.
the arguments the court postponed were scheduled for april 20-22 and april 27-29. the most high profile argument that was postponed was the hearing of the consolidated cases of trump v. pennsylvania and little sisters of the poor v. pennsylvania. those cases have to do with the mandate in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, forcing all employers to provide contraception in the health insurance policies that they reimburse.
levin: but we pay most of the bills.
and yet, medicare-for-all remains popular with voters. exit polls from super tuesday found that half of all voters supported replacing private health insurance with a government-run system. around 70 percent of voters in maine and vermont supported this plan.
it's just become an ideological fixation, obama said, adding: there is no doubt that in implementing the affordable care act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. ... that's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. it's true of apple rolling out the new ipad.
i'm all set for bernie, communist, trump began. and then we have this crazy thing that happened on tuesday, which he thought was thursday. but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the u.s. senate -- there's something going on there.
in the new hampshire primary, sanders and buttigieg each picked up nine delegates to the democratic national convention, while klobuchar picked up six. no other democratic picked up a single delegate. so while sanders won slightly more popular votes, the contest was a draw between him and buttigieg in the delegate count.
here's a startling fact about socialism that every child should hear: during the past century, tens of millions of people have been killed, exiled or imprisoned by socialist and communist parties, and no country has ever successfully enacted a system that matches marx's vision for the world – a reality even the staunchest marxist will admit.
pelosi went on to say in her interview with the post that she doesn't support impeachment because it divides the country. that's a topic pelosi knows a lot about. this is the same person who told the american people in 2017 that if the republican plan to repeal and replace obamacare passed, hundreds of thousands of people will die.
levin: there are a lot of other reasons.

our preference is to make this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions from our republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same. but if our republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them, schumer said on the senate floor thursday.
and this certainly raises the same profile. the president's expressing frustration that congress is not doing what he thinks congress has to do. but of course he's a different branch. and we have three branches in this system. and no president can take on the powers of all three branches. and that's what he seems to be doing. he certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. he isn't being particularly coy about this. you know, he says this is what i wanted to get out of legislation. and i'm going to do it on my own. and that does become a government of one.
the coronavirus was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on super tuesday. over half of voters in five states, including california and texas, said the illness caused by the virus was an important factor shaping their vote, according to exit polls.

the supreme court said that it may reschedule some cases from the march and april oral argument sessions that were put off before the end of its current term, scheduled to end in june. it also said that it will consider a range of scheduling options and other alternatives if arguments cannot be held in the courtroom before the end of the term.
the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the ruling said. the court sent the case back down to a lower court to decide on whether the mandate is severable from the rest of the law, which would allow other parts of obamacare to survive.

president biden told reporters thursday that coronavirus relief will be passed with or without the support of congressional republicans.

kytv: amid the empty shelves and store closures, a springfield [mo.] walmart had its own commotion going wednesday afternoon. a baby was born in the toilet paper aisle of the walmart at sunshine and west bypass. one walmart customer didn't have a chance to get any of those groceries she came for, but she left with something much more special. 'we were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,' said store manager jessica hinkle. hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. when the woman's water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right then and there. 'we were like what do we do now?' she said. 'another lady comes around the corner and she says 'i'm a labor nurse, can i help?' and we said yes, yes please. she had gloves in her pocket [and] she was ready.' hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible. … springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl. 'they're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves,' hinkle said. she said the entire process took about 45 minutes and customers were cheering for the woman the whole time.

biden wants you to think he's a moderate who favors a much less costly plan that would build on obamacare. but the former vice president's plan still features its fair share of tax increases that would hamstring our economy and take a bite out of the average family's wallet.

really going out on a limb… gillibrand backs biden - wapo: sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) threw her support behind former vice president joe biden on thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the democratic nominee for president. 'he's the absolute best candidate to defeat president trump, and i think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the american people in a way that no one else has,' gillibrand said in an interview with the washington post. 'the truth is he's run the strongest campaign.'
which raises a legitimate question: do democrats actually want to win the white house in november?
i really like what he's doing with china, which has been stealing our technology and is expanding militarily in so many ways. i wish our media would focus on some of that and he's reversed the obama administration's policy vis a vis iran, which is a terrorist state that has killed american soldiers, which obviously is building icbms not for tel aviv, but for los angeles.

former vice president joe biden, who is challenging sanders for the democratic presidential nomination, argues correctly that medicare-for-all is unaffordable.
the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in december that part of the law is now unconstitutional and their decision cast a cloud over the rest.
nyt: [former vice president joe biden] has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. that has opened the path for democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. in discussions with the times since mr. biden's big primary victories on tuesday, 60 democratic national committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of mr. biden as his running mate — senator kamala harris of california, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. next up was stacey abrams, a former state house leader whose defeat in 2018 georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party. other popular suggestions included senator catherine cortez masto of nevada and representative val demings of florida. the democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including govs. gretchen whitmer of michigan and michelle lujan grisham of new mexico.

continetti: coronavirus tests america's social capacity - free beacon: a few months after september 11, 2001, david brooks went back and looked at coverage of pearl harbor for an article in the weekly standard ('after pearl harbor,' december 10, 2001). … i revisited brooks's article this week while thinking about the differences between america during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and america during the wuhan coronavirus pandemic today. … what changed is the american ethos. expressive individualism replaced self-restraint. narcissism and the therapeutic sensibility triumphed over the reticence and sense of tragedy that comes from living in places and times where there is no safety net and death is a constant presence. the culture of debunking, revisionism, and repudiation informs education, entertainment, art, and occasionally sport.

i'll always talk about it, because to me it's very important, trump said. the good thing about the debt is we're paying almost no interest. he added that more cuts would be coming but that it was crucially important to fund the military in the meantime.
obamacare under fire: lawsuit, tax repeals and 'medicare-for-all' push leave aca fate unclear
plan has payments of $1,200 per person for middle class and poor - fox news: saying lawmakers 'need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,' senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the u.s. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. the draft legislation, obtained by fox news, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. the rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer's income exceeds the legislation's threshold. the amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. the irs would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return...
