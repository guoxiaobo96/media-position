road trip? for many vacationers across the country, travel plans are jammed in neutral, as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight. it's frustrating. it seems like we do this more and more, year after year, said eric kelso, a frequent parks visitor who's cutting his trip to joshua tree national park short this year.\n\nmartha stewart shares bizarre hack for making scrambled eggs: 'the whitest thing i've ever seen'\n\nmost national parks, museums, and other government institutions remain shuttered for the time being, forcing many travelers to change their vacation plans or scrap them altogether. sarah ellis sparks made a lengthy journey to washington to explore america's history at the smithsonian and other institutions, only to be met with disappointment instead of national treasures. they need to open everything up because people are coming from like...i'm coming from alabama, i flew down here -- to see nothing, she said.\n\nvacationers aren't the only ones feeling the squeeze. the u.s. travel association reports the shutdown is costing the industry more than $100 million a day. that means tour operations need to change plans too. some 82 percent say they've adjusted itineraries – with almost half reporting major cancellations. they're more slowed in terms of those parts of the industry. you know, the parks are open but certain portions or parts of the parks are closed down, said zach burau, founder of the subscription travel service wanderlift.\n\nfollow us on facebook for more fox lifestyle news\n\nit's a big gamble for vacationers who roll the dice and go forward with their plans. many park visitors, like sven schumacher, say they need to seek out non-government services and lodging – sometimes at higher prices. they are independent of the government shutdown which was good for us and we also had to choose them because on the homepages and also on the phones the people were not available so there was a huge impact.\n\ntravel experts expect losses to keep piling up as long as the government remains shut down. if this thing goes on past a month and a half or two months, i think you will see some effects and then the severity of those effects could continue as the shutdown goes on, burau said.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\na prolonged shutdown could impact travel further down the road when it comes to booking trips now. about 800,000 federal workers are expected to miss paychecks this week.\n\neditor's note: a previous version of this report used outdated data from the u.s. travel association on the impacts of government shutdowns on the travel and hotel industries.\n\nsteve rappoport is a newscast producer and anchor for fox news radio. follow him on twitter @steverappoport.
democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the white house and across the country on thursday, just one day before the partial government shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck.\n\nas president trump visited the southern border in mcallen, texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began dec. 22.\n\nroughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and are working unpaid. an additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. on thursday afternon, after assurances from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., that president trump will sign the bill, the senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the ongoing government shut down.\n\nstatistics provided by the department of labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of december, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\n\nshutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in washington, d.c., on thursday. some near the white house chanted, do your jobs, so we can do ours.\n\nladies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government -- of the people, for the people and by the people, hoyer continued.\n\nalso speaking at the rally, democratic virginia sen. mark warner accused trump of using federal workers as pawns.\n\nprotesters initially gathered near the afl-cio building in washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on republicans.\n\nlet's call this shutdown what it is: it's a lockout, afl-cio president richard trumka shouted. shame on the senate. shame on the white house. this lockout has to end, and it has to end now.\n\ntwo large unions representing federal workers -- the american federation of government employees and the national treasury employees union -- have argued it is illegal to force workers to show up to their jobs without pay.\n\nvermont independent sen. bernie sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to trump's tuesday night address from the oval office, also rallied attendees on thursday. sanders has consistently accused the white house of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.\n\ntoday we say to this president, 'grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,' sanders said.\n\nmaryland democratic sens. benjamin cardin and chris van hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did connecticut democratic sen. richard blumenthal.\n\nother rallies were taking place in atlanta, denver and ogden, utah, where some 5,000 irs workers are affected by the shutdown, according to kuer npr utah. a local food bank reported that 50 percent more families have showed up this week than the last.\n\ndemocrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid transportation security administration (tsa) officials are calling out sick at airports.\n\nwatch: airports report longer security lines as tsa agents call out sick\n\nhe thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, house speaker nancy pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the white house on wednesday. but they can't. (trump walked out of the meeting after pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)\n\nalthough trump has said that most of the people not getting paid are democrats, he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown.\n\ni can relate, trump told reporters this weekend. and i'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. they always do. and they'll make adjustments. people understand exactly what's going on. many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what i'm doing.\n\nthere is not gonna be any bend right here, trump added.\n\nthe shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.\n\ntrump again asserts power to declare national emergency during border visit\n\nsome workers are relying on donations, including launching gofundme campaigns. a food pantry has opened up at a coast guard base in boston.\n\ngabrielle roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on twitter: applied for unemployment....even though i have a job... surreal.\n\nessential government workers, like tsa agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. while furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.\n\nhowever, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.\n\ncnn reporter jim acosta inadvertently makes case for building steel slats at border\n\ntheodore atkinson, a furloughed trial attorney in the justice department's civil division, told the associated press he is spending extraordinarily stressful days anxiously watching the news at his home in baltimore.\n\nhe was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. but this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said.\n\nwith two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. but if the shutdown stretches into february, he may need to take out another.\n\nit's all uncertain and i don't know how it ends or resolves itself, he said. this isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. i can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nnegotiations to end the shutdown stalled on thursday, as trump, during his visit to the u.s.-mexico border in texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.\n\ntrump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in mcallen. the president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.\n\nif we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, trump said of human trafficking. the president then took part in a briefing by border agents.\n\nback in washington, democrats on thursday were blocked in the senate after trying to proceed with house-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. sen. mitch mcconnell, the republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.\n\nfox news' alex pappas and the associated press contributed to this report.
japan declared a state of emergency in tokyo and three nearby areas on thursday as coronavirus cases continue to surge, hitting a daily record of 2,447 in the capital.\n\nprime minister yoshihide suga issued the declaration at the government task force for the coronavirus. it lasts from friday until feb. 7, and centers around asking restaurants and bars to close at 8 p.m. and people to stay home and not mingle in crowds.\n\nthe declaration carries no penalties. but it works as a strong request while japan juggles to keep its economy going.\n\njapanese governors demand state of emergency over covid\n\nshopping malls and schools will remain open. movie theaters, museums and other events will be asked to reduce attendance. places that defy the request will be publicized on a list, while those that comply will be eligible for aid, according to officials.\n\ni am confident we can overcome this, but i must ask all of you to endure a restricted life for a while longer, suga told reporters after the declaration.\n\nhe promised more aid for hospitals treating covid-19 patients. the japanese military is ready to help, and efforts are underway to get a vaccine approved and delivered, he added.\n\nplease take this matter seriously as your own, to protect all precious life, your parents, your grandparents, family and friends, over generations, suga said.\n\ncoronavirus cases have been surging in japan following year-end and new year's holidays.\n\nshigeru omi, a doctor who heads the government panel on coronavirus measures, described the latest wave as explosive, requiring the emergency declaration.\n\ntokyo has logged record numbers of daily cases for two straight days, after 1,591 on wednesday. nationwide, cases have been growing steadily by more than 5,000 a day.\n\nsome experts say japan should have acted sooner, and a government campaign to promote domestic travel through discounts was a mistake.\n\nopinion on having eateries close early is mixed, since places could simply get more crowded in earlier hours.\n\ndr. hiroshi nishiura, an expert on infectious diseases, said the rate of increase in number of cases will decline but infections will continue to rise. he believes more drastic action is needed.\n\nvaccinations are expected to start next month in japan, with health and essential workers first. the rollout is likely to take months.\n\ndr. atsuo hamada, an expert on infections and professor at tokyo medical university hospital, said curtailing nighttime drinking and dining will help.\n\nwhen people go out to eat at night, they tend to get drunk, talk in loud voices and sing so airborne infections spread more quickly, he said in a recent telephone interview.\n\nkeeping covid-19 infections under control is imperative for japan with the tokyo olympics set for july. politicians have repeatedly stressed it must go on despite an increasingly doubtful public.\n\nspreading virus pulls olympic torches off display in japan\n\na similar state of emergency was issued last april through late may, and was eventually widened to apply nationwide.\n\nthe effort was largely effective. japanese tend to follow orders from authorities, even without the threat of penalties. almost everyone has been wearing masks.\n\na legal change is needed to allow for penalties in emergency declarations, and such a move is set to be considered in parliament. a strict lockdown, like ones in europe, is not being considered.\n\nyoshimasa maruyama, chief economist at smbc nikko securities, said the economic damage from the declaration will be limited, with real gross domestic product growth likely to be pushed down by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nthe emergency last year affected a wider part of the economy, and it coincided with the time when the economy was already struggling amid plunging global trade, he said.\n\nother economists are projecting a slightly greater negative impact on gdp.\n\nduring the second quarter last year, japan's economy shrank nearly 8%, but has gradually rebounded, growing 5% in the july-september 2020 period.\n\ntrade has stagnated, although hopes are high for a gradual recovery. some parts of asia have not been as affected by the coronavirus as the u.s. and europe.\n\nstill, the restaurant and hotel sectors will be slammed, and government assistance is needed, maruyama said.\n\nshingo sakai, who runs la rochelle french cuisine restaurants in tokyo, said fine dining takes more than two hours, and his customers usually don't get out of the office until after 6 p.m.\n\nwe have to keep our dining quality, and at the same time we need to keep our reputation by following the government order, he said.\n\ni have to think about cutting costs to keep the company alive. there's no place to cut costs because i did that for the last six months. there's no room for that.\n\njapan's unemployment rate has risen, but has not shot up, hovering at about 3%. bankruptcies related to the coronavirus total about 800 so far, high for japan, according to tokyo shoko research.\n\nbut shopping districts have been packed, a situation that has contributed to the most recent virus wave.\n\nclick here for the fox news app\n\nsome 250,000 cases have been confirmed nationwide with more than 3,700 deaths, according to the health ministry. hospitals are getting stretched thin.\n\ntokyo gov. yuriko koike and the heads of neighboring saitama, chiba and kanagawa prefectures asked the government for the emergency declaration over the weekend.\n\nwe need to now recognize that virus infections have entered a totally new stage, she said. tokyo is making the protection of human life a top priority.
shame on mitt romney. publishing an ad hominem attack on president trump in the washington post on the cusp of occupying a senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the oval office was dishonorable. in addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about romney: that he is not to be trusted.\n\nyou have to ask, what was the senator-elect from utah thinking? that by proclaiming that president trump had not risen to the mantle of the office romney would protect himself from a trumpian taint? to what end? it's hard to imagine.\n\nit is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a gop-turncoat talking head, as ex-sen. jeff flake, r-ariz., may hope to become. last year, anti-trumper flake met with msnbc president phil griffin and cnn's chief jeff zucker, sparking speculation that post-senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.\n\nliz peek: let's look past the liberal media gloom factory and celebrate the good news this christmas\n\nthat's not romney's situation. could it be that romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and vice president mike pence at the same time? does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case gop leaders have to go to their bench? it isn't going to happen.\n\nand especially after writing the anti-trump op-ed. republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a gallup poll.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nafter his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, romney made the rounds of important republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. i spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. the near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.\n\nthat isn't to say that many republican voters don't regret romney's defeat. the former massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than barack obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.\n\nalso, romney had foreign policy chops. his comments about russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by president obama, who thought he knew better.\n\nbut, romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. millions of americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the u.s. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected donald trump.\n\nromney would not have pulled us out of the paris climate agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. he would have been too polite to throw over the iran nuke deal, or to confront the chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our nato allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put america first.\n\nin his op-ed in the washington post, romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align u.s. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on china's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.\n\nbut would mitt have done those things? would he have stood behind supreme court nominee (and now justice) brett kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?\n\nno, we saw during his 2012 campaign that romney did not have the steel to go the distance. after he trounced obama in the first debate between the two, romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.\n\nromney refused to go after obama on the shameful lies about the deaths of americans in benghazi, wouldn't challenge the president on his handling of the auto industry meltdown and allowed democrats to paint him as anti-female.\n\nmitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump.\n\nif he couldn't stand up to obama, how would romney have fared with chinese president xi jinping?\n\nbut there is a more profound reason that romney lost to obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. while president trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. maybe he thought american voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.\n\nmitt romney helped create or rebuild great companies like staples, sealy (the mattress firm) and the sports authority, creating wealth not only for his firm bain capital but also for investors. those businesses also created thousands of jobs. romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.\n\nthat is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from romney's presidential campaign. running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.\n\nmitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump. he is not alone. there are reasons why many republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and romney's op-ed detailed many of those.\n\nbut a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the american voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.\n\ni am disappointed that romney chose to do otherwise.\n\nclick here to read more by liz peek
the topic is discussed so often it might seem like old news, yet ongoing questions about the future of aircraft carriers are as, if not more, relevant today than at any other time. are carriers obsolete? are they too large and vulnerable to long-range precision carrier-killer missiles to operate close enough to shore to project power? will the navy architect a new generation of differently configured carriers? perhaps smaller, faster and more agile?\n\nto the extent that the navy's recently released 30-year shipbuilding plan offers a glimpse into current thinking about future naval warfare, it is clear that the question will continue to receive very significant attention. the text of the plan states that, moving through the next five years and beyond, the navy plans to analyze carrier evolution, by writing that the service continues to meet full funding requirements for cvn 80/81 and advanced procurement for a cvn in 2026. the department also recognizes the need for continued exploration of carrier evolution and expects to conduct an analysis of alternatives within the fydp (five year defense spending plan) to inform potential requirements.\n\ncvn 80 and 81, the third and fourth ford-class carriers, are already well underway following the successful construction of the first-in-class uss ford which is now nearing deployment.\n\nnavy accelerates new ship radar to support emerging 'sea-attack' strategy\n\nthe question regarding the future has been studied extensively in recent years through a number of formal navy studies, and many weapons developers continue to ponder a range of potential contingencies. some of these include greater use of f-35b armed amphibious assault ships for carrier-like power projection missions. certainly, having 5th gen attack capability extends the tactical and operational envelope for amphibs, and newer amphibs are being engineered with new abilities to command and control large fleets of surface, air and even undersea drones. would amphibs be less vulnerable targets sufficiently capable of sustaining a high-op tempo sortie rate for maritime attack?\n\nother major factors include the large-scale incorporation of surface, air and undersea drones, meaning carriers could operate at safer standoff distances when enabled by new platforms such as the mq-25 stingray, a first-of-its-kind drone able to nearly double the strike range of carrier-launched fighter jets such as f-35s and f/a-18s. then there is the question of evolving ship defenses, meaning newer kinds of layered defense weapons to include ew (electronic warfare), lasers, aerial sensor nodes, advanced radar and faster computer processing for fire control all continue to massively improve carriers' ability to operate safely in high-threat environments such as waters within striking range of china's heavily touted carrier-killer df-26 and df-21d anti-ship missiles. fast-evolving ship defense technologies are likely one reason why senior navy leaders continue to emphasize that u.s. carriers are going nowhere soon and can operate wherever they need to, whenever they need to when called upon. while the mission to project massive attack power from the sea is by any estimation here to stay, its particular size, shape and technological configuration certainly may evolve.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ndrone evolution may be the hidden key to all of this in several respects. certainly the navy's mq-25 will not be the only carrier-launched drone to emerge, as others will likely follow, and how about the idea of large unmanned carrier-like platforms launching unmanned strike assets? all while command and control operations are performed by human sailors at safer standoff ranges? that would certainly change the equation when it comes to operating in high-risk areas more vulnerable to enemy fire. as part of this equation, it would seem important to point out that the navy is already well on the way to engineering new large unmanned ships such as the medium and large unmanned surface vessel programs. large drone boats could perform anti-submarine warfare, conduct reconnaissance operations and even coordinate strikes for aircraft from strategically vital vantage points enabling maritime forces to project power from wherever needed.\n\n-- kris osborn is the managing editor of warrior maven and the defense editor of the national interest --\n\nkris osborn is the defense editor for the national interest*.* osborn previously served at the pentagon as a highly qualified expert with the office of the assistant secretary of the army—acquisition, logistics & technology. osborn has also worked as an anchor and on-air military specialist at national tv networks. he has appeared as a guest military expert on fox news, msnbc, the military channel, and the history channel. he also has a masters degree in comparative literature from columbia university.
james corden shared a message of hope with his audience after violence broke out at the capitol building on wednesday.\n\nthe late-night host was among the first to comment on the events that took place at the capitol in his opening monologue, which was shared ahead of his wednesday night broadcast on cbs. in it, the host, who is operating out of his garage due to increased coronavirus cases in los angeles, looked visibly rattled as he went over the events that happened earlier in the day.\n\nwhat a crazy… sad day, he began. a day that will go down as a dark one in the long history of america. we've all sat today, glued to the pictures of trump supporters breaching the capitol, fighting with police, shouting in the chambers of congress or flagrantly popping a selfie as they sit with their feet up in the government's offices.\n\nthe host, like many celebrities, then turned his attention to donald trump's role in the situation.\n\nfans shocked that james corden doesn't always drive on 'carpool karaoke'\n\nthen under the pretense of trying to calm the situation, their hero, the president, released a message this afternoon to tell his supporters that they're special and we love you. i wouldn't want to even imagine his treatment or response to those people if they had been wearing black lives matter hats instead of red maga ones, he said.\n\nthe british comedian noted that, despite how upset or hopeless people may feel in the wake of what happened, he says growing up idolizing america from afar is helping him maintain hope for the nation.\n\nbecause i think if there is one thing that we can have after the last month in this country, it's hope, he continued. you know, as an outsider growing up in england, i used to look to america as this beacon of light and possibility. a place where anything can happen, a place where you'd be lucky to work. a place where many people that i knew used to fantasize about living here. a place that gives an individual more opportunity than they would get elsewhere but cares for their fellow man.\n\njames corden teases he may leave 'late late show' and move back to uk\n\nhe continued: today people across the world would have looked at these pictures from washington and wondered, 'what on earth has happened to this great country?' but i truly believe, and make no mistake, that they know that the america that they admire still exists. they know that the america that so many aspire to will be back. it's just been hijacked by a lunatic and his crazy army for the last four years.\n\ncorden went on to note that people have reason to be hopeful because, in two weeks, on those same steps, where that mob fought and pushed passed police, joe biden will be sworn in as the president of the united states.\n\nclick here to sign up for our entertainment newsletter\n\nhe went on to note how inspired he feels at seeing the victory of democratic senate candidates jon ossoff and raphael warnock in georgia, whose victory on wednesday solidified the party's control of the senate going into biden's presidency.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ntoday was the last dance at the worst party we've ever been to, corden concluded. so if you can, have hope. you've seen in these past two weeks that voting counts, change is coming, science is real, vaccines are on the way. i really do believe that there are better times ahead.
after a year plagued by privacy scandals, hate speech controversies, the viral spread of disinformation and the public airing of his company's internal communication, facebook ceo mark zuckerberg used his year-end note to focus on the positive ー drawing the scorn of critics who blasted the billionaire as tone deaf and out of touch.\n\nas he looked back on a year that saw his company's stock price drop and scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle calling for new, strict privacy regulations in the wake of cambridge analytica, zuckerberg spent a chunk of his note boasting that 2 billion people now use one of facebook's services and the tech giant has empowered countless small businesses.\n\ni'm proud of the progress we've made, he wrote in the letter, which notes that facebook now employs 30,000 people who focus on safety, but does not dwell on the specifics of any particular challenge or scandal.\n\nzuckerberg wrote that facebook is a very different company than it was two years ago and has fundamentally altered [its] dna to prioritize the prevention of harm. he also wrote that he learned a lot in the last year, but a range of critics took issue with the tone of his note.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nwhen read as a whole, the post simply confirms one thing about facebook. no change has affected (or is designed to affect) the leading cause of facebook's problems ー the business model, wrote paul armstrong, a tech adviser, in forbes. without this, facebook is doomed to become irrelevant to other platforms or become extremely dangerous and be broken up.\n\narmstrong's advice to facebook for 2019 includes banning all political advertising, atomic bombing facebook's algorithm-driven newsfeed and verifying all news sources on the network.\n\nmark zuckerberg is a bit out of touch with people's perception, mark douglas, ceo of digital advertising platform steelhouse, told cheddar. it's going to be a rocky year, that's clear.\n\nthey are the least trusted company in tech. they are going to have to rebuild the trust with the users or they are going to lose those users, douglas explained.\n\nchinese schools enforce 'smart uniforms' with gps tracking to surveil students\n\nalthough facebook has continued to see its monthly active users increase globally, the company is confronting flat growth in parts of north america and decreased growth in europe. besides that fact that it was harnessed by russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, facebook confronted a series of false rumors on whatsapp, which it also owns, that led to more than 20 people being lynched in india.\n\ncesar sayoc, who stands accused of sending 13 pipe bombs through the mail to a range of prominent democrats and critics of president trump, trafficked in conspiracy theories, white supremacy and anti-semitism on his facebook profile. and the menlo park, calif. company stands accused of furthering ethnic cleansing in myanmar, where the military has targeted the country's mostly muslim rohingya minority group with severe violence.\n\na number of critics called on zuckerberg to step down or take a break from leading the company.\n\nleslie miley, former cto of the obama foundation, said the 34-year-old silicon valley executive should resign and find a pursuit that will teach him humility and help him find his moral compass.\n\nthe executive director of color of change, a racial advocacy group that has tangled with facebook over its treatment of minorities, told the guardian that zuckerberg desperately needs to begin implementing systemic solutions, in a way that is transparent, rebuilds the public trust and provides a safer platform for all people.\n\nnew year's eve times square drone grounded due to weather, nypd says\n\nthe head of the electronic frontier foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization, told the guardian that zuckerberg should find a new job in 2019, while techcrunch called the ceo's letter tone deaf.\n\nsome other critics were not as harsh.\n\nit means personally committing to a facebook that doesn't accidentally make decisions that aid violent regimes, white supremacists and other bad actors, dia kayyali, program manager at witness, told the guardian. above all, it means simply being honest about facebook's largely detrimental role in global society. that would be the biggest challenge of all\n\nfacebook has managed to make enemies on both sides of the aisle on capitol hill, with democrats calling for more regulation and some republicans claiming the network is biased against them, and it faces ftc and fbi probes.\n\n2019 is not starting out better, that's for sure, douglas said.
cnn's legal analyst jeffrey toobin, who is currently away from the network amid a masturbation scandal, on wednesday morning sent a cryptic tweet declaring he'll be back before quickly deleting it.\n\nmany thanks. i'l be back, toobin wrote in the now-deleted tweet.\n\nit is unclear if toobin intended to send someone a private message or if he simply had a change of heart and deleted the public message. it is also unclear if he meant he'll be back on cnn, the network that granted him a leave of absence following reports of his lewd behavior.\n\ncnn's jeffrey toobin fired by new yorker magazine following zoom call masturbation incident\n\ncnn's star analyst fell from grace when he was fired from his job as a staff writer at the new yorker magazine following an investigation into an incident in which he was caught masturbating during a zoom call with colleagues.\n\ncnn has not taken action against the tech-challenged toobin and has remained silent about his status at the network despite recently hiring contributor evan osnos, who is also a staff writer at the new yorker and was reportedly an eyewitness to toobin's alleged misconduct on the infamous zoom call.\n\ncnn did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding toobin's tweet and has stayed mum on toobin's status.\n\nthe new york times on tuesday published a lengthy article on the situation headlined, the undoing of jeffrey toobin, that featured a cnn staffer hinting the network will give him an opportunity to return and noted that he was still employed by the liberal network.\n\ncnn says jeffrey toobin still employed as report suggests he may get second chance after masturbation scandal\n\nthree cnn employees say that network president, jeff zucker, is a big fan of mr. toobin's and a believer in second chances, the times reported.\n\nthe times also reported new details of the incident.\n\n[toobin] was seen lowering and raising his computer camera, exposing and touching his penis, and motioning an air kiss to someone other than his colleagues, witness masha gessen told the times. i was really, truly shocked.\n\nlast year, thewrap founder and ceo sharon waxman – a women's rights advocate – wrote that toobin's situation reeks of male privilege and asked where cnn has been.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nwhen your job is to weigh facts and render conclusions that shape public opinion, one's own judgment should matter, waxman wrote, noting that cnn has persistently avoided all questions about his future at the network.\n\nwaxman wrote that she spoke to several prominent women in media who all agreed that a woman would never be able to get away with similar actions.
bacteria on the international space station are evolving and changing in their strange orbital environment -- but according to a new study, they don't seem to be any more dangerous to humans.\n\nthat's good news for astronauts, as some previous research suggested that space travel might make certain microbes mutate into strains that are more harmful to people.\n\nthere has been a lot of speculation about radiation, microgravity and the lack of ventilation and how that might affect living organisms, including bacteria, lead study author erica hartmann, a biological design professor at northwestern university, said in a statement. these are stressful, harsh conditions, leading researchers to wonder if space travel would increase the odds that bacteria would evolve into so-called superbugs to survive.\n\nbased on the new study, published today (jan. 8) in the journal msystems, the answer appears to be 'no,' hartmann said.\n\nin the study, researchers analyzed dna from two kinds of bacteria that had taken a trip to the iss: staphylococcus aureus (which is found on skin and causes staph infections) and bacillus cereus (which is present in digestive systems and soil and usually harmless). both microbes were collected from the ambient environment of the space station and probably hitched a ride to space on the skin of astronauts or inside their bodies. the results revealed that while the returned bacteria had mutated differently than their earthbound counterparts, they hadn't developed any of the obvious genetic traits of superbugs. (superbugs are bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics.) [over earth: day & night from iss]\n\non earth, the researchers said, bacteria routinely fall away from the human bodies they prefer to inhabit and undergo changes to adapt to nonliving surfaces. but researchers were especially concerned that the close quarters of spacecraft, where humans and bacteria share the same air and small spaces for months on end, might produce dangerous changes.\n\nit seems, however, that while the bacteria did change themselves to adapt to space, those changes didn't produce any abnormalities that would make them produce diseases that would be more infectious or difficult to treat.\n\nthis is good news for long-term spaceflight. while nasa's rigorous quarantine procedures before launches have made infectious diseases in space exceedingly rare, the prospect of an outbreak in a sealed spacecraft speeding toward mars remains alarming. so far, though, it seems that nothing about the space environment itself is working to make that bacterial risk any more dire — even if there are other health issues to worry about.\n\noriginally published on live science.
the two u.s. senate runoff elections that will be held in georgia tuesday will determine whether the senate will work in partnership with president-elect joe biden to build a better future for americans, or whether republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.\n\ngeorgia is a formerly red state that turned semi-blue in november, when a majority of voters wisely cast their ballots for former vice president biden.\n\nand yes, despite president trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that biden carried georgia. trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.\n\nrichard fowler: in georgia senate races, key voting bloc gives democrats excellent chance of winning\n\nit's in the national interest for georgia voters to follow up on their support for president-elect biden by voting tuesday to elect democrats jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock to the senate. both men are highly qualified. their election will give biden the democratic majority he needs in the senate to repair the enormous damage trump has caused to our nation in the past four years.\n\nthe incoming administration of president-elect biden and vice president-elect kamala harris needs a senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.\n\nunfortunately and disgracefully, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the biden administration.\n\nrecall that mcconnell famously stated in 2010: the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one-term president.\n\nso mcconnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the american people. not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. no, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt president obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the american people. you can bet every penny you have that mcconell feels the same way about our incoming president.\n\nthe best way to stop mcconnell is to elect ossoff and warnock to give democrats 50 senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 republican senators. vice president harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give democrats majority control of the senate.\n\ntaking a page from trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, republican sens. kelly loeffler (running against warnock) and david perdue (running against ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective democratic challengers as radical socialists.\n\nnothing could be further from the truth.\n\ntrump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in georgia or across the united states in the november election, and i don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in georgia.\n\nthe truth is that warnock and ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo president-elect biden's hopeful unifying message. they are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering georgians in these perilous times.\n\nwarnock, the only black candidate in the tuesday runoff, is the senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the former pulpit of the rev. dr. martin luther king jr.\n\nthe demonization of this pastor who now preaches in dr. king's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in georgia of hostility to its black residents. in fact, georgia has never elected a single black u.s. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. and yet the census bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is black.\n\nwarnock rose in georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand medicaid for low-income residents of the state. he supports increased covid-19 relief funding, expanding the affordable care act (the aca, also known as obamacare), and passing the john lewis voting rights act.\n\nwarnock has been endorsed by former presidents jimmy carter (a fellow georgian) and obama, and by former u.n. ambassador and atlanta mayor andrew young. warnock is also backed by former democratic candidate for governor of georgia and georgia house of representatives minority leader stacey abrams of fair fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in georgia.\n\nossoff is a georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. he also previously worked as a national security aide for rep. hank johnson, d-ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.\n\nlike warnock, ossoff supports strengthening the aca, increased covid-19 relief, criminal justice reform, and lower taxes for working families and small businesses in georgia.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nloeffler and perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge president-elect biden's victory. they agree with anything trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. they act as if they are running to be selected by trump to be his employees on the apprentice, rather than to represent the people of georgia in the senate.\n\nloeffler and perdue were both against additional $2,000 covid-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after trump's belated tweet storm). they have both questioned the integrity of the november election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow republican, georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger.\n\ntruth be told, loeffler and perdue — not warnock and ossoff — are the radical candidates running in georgia. the republican candidates are out-of-touch with georgia voters and values and reject their senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic. their only loyalty is to donald trump and to their own self-interest.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ni implore georgians to turn history on its head and to get out the vote for democratic candidates raphael warnock and jon ossoff on tuesday. record numbers of early votes are a good sign for the two democrats, but the election will be close and now they need as many supporters as possible to vote tuesday.\n\nall eyes are on you, georgia. the health, safety and security of the american people are at stake.\n\nclick here for more from donna brazile
billionaire tom steyer, the outspoken liberal megadonor and former hedge fund manager who has led a campaign for president trump's immediate impeachment, will not run for president in 2020, he announced wednesday.\n\ninstead, steyer, who spoke at an event in des moines, iowa, declared that he will undertake and oversee a laundry list of activities in 2019 aimed at removing trump from office.\n\nmost people come to iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president, steyer said in his prepared remarks. but i am proud to be here to announce that i will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.\n\namong steyer's goals: a multi-million dollar digital initiative aimed at informing the public and members of congress about the 10 impeachable offenses that trump has already committed, town halls across the country, and even an impeachment summit in late january that will bring more than 250 supporters from across the country to d.c. together to learn about historical precedent for impeachment.\n\nthat summit, steyer promised, would be followed by an advocacy day that will include impeachment summit participants fanning out across capitol hill to hand deliver articles of impeachment drafted by legal scholars to members of congress with the simple message: 'we did half the work, now it's up to you to finish the job.'\n\nsteyer vowed in a statement to spend 100% of his time and energy focused on removing donald trump from power through the group need to impeach, which he founded in october 2017. he committed to spending $40 million on the effort to have trump removed from office in 2019.\n\ndems react after new congresswoman vowed to 'impeach the motherf---er'\n\nthis is the biggest issue in american politics today, steyer said in his speech wednesday. we have a lawless president in the white house who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. donald trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in america — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. it is past time for members of congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. the question remaining is, what will congress do?\n\nsteyer had been considered by many analysts to be a potential contender for the white house, and had taken apparent steps in that direction. in recent months he ran television advertisements in which he appeared personally to call for trump's removal, appeared at numerous political events, and even named a potential campaign manager.\n\nin early december, steyer laid the groundwork for a political platform, speaking alongside a panel in charleston, s.c., at one of five scheduled town halls. each event focused on the five rights of his potential campaign platform, which he called the social contract for the 21st century.\n\nwhile some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.\n\nin 2013 he founded nextgen america, a political action committee and nonprofit working to combat climate change.\n\nlike massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who has announced that she's formed an exploratory committee ahead of a possible presidential run, steyer often has tangled publicly and personally with trump.\n\nlast october, trump took a personal shot at steyer, deriding him as a wacky and crazed & stumbling lunatic and asserting that if he is running for president, the dems will eat him alive!\n\nthe remarks came after steyer -- among the prominent liberals who received a threatening suspicious package earlier in the month -- said he absolutely was blaming trump for creating an atmosphere in which anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.\n\nsteyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken trump supporter in florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a pittsburgh synagogue in late october.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nalthough steyer seemingly won't be on the ballot in 2020, members of his team emphasized that they felt the democrats had momentum.\n\nwith a new congress now seated, and a majority of democrats in the house, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, need to impeach lead strategist kevin mack said in a statement. we're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of congress accountable until donald trump is out of the white house.\n\nbut, top democrats seemed less than enthusiastic about introducing impeachment articles. last week, house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., downplayed freshman rep. rashida tlaib's profanity-laced vow to impeach trump, as republicans strongly condemned the language.\n\nmeanwhile, house majority leader steny hoyer said he didn't think comments like these particularly help. and rep. emanuel cleaver, d-mo., said members were aghast at tlaib, d-mich., lamenting a fever among some colleagues to impeach trump.\n\nhouse judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler, d-n.y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned tlaib's comments.\n\ni don't like that language, nadler told cnn. more to the point, i disagree with what she said. it is too early to talk about that intelligently. we have to follow the facts and get the facts.\n\nfox news' pat ward and brooke singman contributed to this report.
the russian hypersonic weapons test is shining light upon an aggressive u.s. plan to prototype, test and deploy hypersonic weapons on an expedited schedule -- to defend against enemy attacks by fast-tracking an ability to launch high-impact, high-speed attacks at mach. 5 - five times the speed of sound.\n\nwe would like all the resources we can build into the kill chain to hit any target or hold it at risk with hypersonic weapons, gen. timothy ray, air force global strike command, said at the air force association air, space & cyber conference in september.\n\nrussian president vladimir putin is, according to numerous news reports and russia's own state news operation, calling the test a tremendous success, adding that the weapon is invincible and ready to enter service next year.\n\nthe actual technological capacity of the new russian weapon has not, as of yet, been verified by public u.s. reports.\n\nlegitimate or not, a russian weapon traveling at hypersonic speeds, naturally, would better enable offensive missile strikes to destroy targets such and enemy ships, buildings, air defenses and even drones and fixed-wing or rotary aircraft -- depending upon the guidance technology available.\n\na key component of this is the fact that weapons traveling at hypersonic speeds would present serious complications for targets hoping to defend against them – they would have only seconds with which to respond or defend against an approaching or incoming attack.\n\nin fact, while emphasizing the current air force push for hypersonic weapons, ray raised this precise concern.\n\nthe challenges becomes your ability to defend against hypersonic weapons - they are not easily defendable, ray told an audience at the afa conference.\n\nalong these lines, the advent of hypersonic weapons is a key reason why some are questioning the future survivability of large platforms such as aircraft carriers. how are ship-based sensors, radar and layered defenses expected to succeed in detecting tracking and intercepting or destroying an approaching hypersonic weapon traveling at five times the speed of sound?\n\nhypersonic weapons will quite likely be engineered as kinetic energy strike weapons, meaning they will not use explosives but rather rely upon sheer speed and the force of impact to destroy targets, developers explain.\n\na super high-speed drone or isr platform would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar or shot down.\n\na drone or unmanned isr platform traveling at hypersonic speeds would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar. (mitchell institute for aerospace studies report on hypersonic weapons here)\n\nalthough potential defensive uses for hypersonic weapons, interceptors or vehicles are by no means beyond the realm of consideration, the principal effort at the moment is to engineer offensive weapons able to quickly destroy enemy targets at great distances.\n\nscientists explain that speed of sound can vary, depending upon the altitude; at the ground level it is roughly 1,100 feet per second. accordingly, if a weapon is engineered with 2,000 seconds worth of fuel – it can travel up to 2,000 miles to a target, former air force chief scientist gregory zacharias told warrior in a previous interview.\n\nthe service recently awarded a second deal to lockheed to expedite prototyping of a hypersonic weapon, called the air launched rapid response weapon, air force news reported.\n\nthe effort involves two separate trajectories, including the air-launched rapid response weapon and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon. the air force has now awarded developmental deals for both systems to lockheed.\n\nthe most recent award was cited recently in the service's around the air force new report, which said that air force secretary heather wilson is moving as fast as possible when it comes to hypersonic weapons.\n\nrecent thinking from senior air force weapons developers had held that u.s. hypersonic weapons might first be deployable by the early 2020s. hypersonic drones for attack or isr missions, by extension, were thought to be on track to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s, senior service officials have told warrior maven.\n\nnow, this aggressive new air force hypersonic weapons prototyping and demonstration effort is expected to change this time frame in a substantial way.\n\na boost-glide hypersonic weapon is one that flies on an upward trajectory up into the earth's atmosphere before using the speed of its descent to hit and destroy targets, senior officials said.\n\nthe hypersonic conventional strike weapon effort involves using technologies which have not yet been integrated for air-launched delivery, an air force spokeswoman told warrior maven earlier this year.\n\nthese kinds of propulsion and weapons technologies are currently informing the exploration of hypersonic drone platforms able to surveil, strike and defend.\n\nlockheed's skunk works division is currently working with the pentagon on the sr-72 hypersonic drone, designed to travel at mach 6. visions for this platform, according to reports from popular mechanics and aviation week, incorporate engineering the drone for strike missions as well. current plans call for a flight research vehicle to be constructed in the early 2020s, with a full-scale version to be in service sometime in the 2030s, the av week report states.\n\nsenior air force weapons developers have explained the rationale in terms of not waiting many more years for a 100-percent solution if a highly impactful 90-percent solution can be available much sooner.\n\noften referred to as agile acquisition by air force senior leaders, to include service secretary heather wilson, fast-tracked procurement efforts seek quicker turnaround of new software enhancements, innovations and promising combat technologies likely to have a substantial near-term impact. while multi-year developmental programs are by no means disappearing, the idea is to circumvent some of the more bureaucratic and cumbersome elements of the acquisition process.\n\nthis hypersonic weapons acceleration is taking place within a high-threat global environment. alongside russia, china has also been visibly conducting hypersonic weapons tests, leading some to raise the question as to whether the u.s. could be behind key rivals in this area.\n\na report in popular mechanics sites chinese state media as having announced a successful test of a new wave-rider hypersonic vehicle.\n\nthe hypersonic vehicle that detached from the booster rocket flew for 400 seconds, achieving a maximum speed of mach 5.5 to 6 (4,200 to 4,600 miles an hour) and reaching an altitude of 100,000 feet, the report says.\n\nalso, a report in the diplomat earlier this year outlines chinese df-17 hypersonic missile tests in november of last year.\n\nin an essay from earlier this year titled hypersonic missiles: a new proliferation challenge, rand scholar richard speier further specifies the seriousness of hypersonic missile threats.\n\nthey are able to evade and conceal their precise targets from defenses until just seconds before impact. this leaves targeted states with almost no time to respond…..hypersonic missiles require a reconsideration of traditional second-strike calculations, as they have the potential to decapitate a nation's leadership before it has the opportunity to launch a counter attack, speier writes.\n\nmore weapons and technology -warrior maven (click here)—
owning the libs doesn't mean giving them two free senate seats, trump 2020 national press secretary hogan gidley told fox & friends weekend on sunday, two days ahead of georgia's crucial runoff elections, which will decide which party controls the senate.\n\nwe have to make sure that republicans maintain control of the senate so that any radical agenda of the left can't come through and destroy this country and remake it into the image of some socialist nation, which is exactly what the democrats are pledging to do, gidley said.\n\nboth georgia senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on tuesday as sen. kelly loeffler, r-ga., faces challenger raphael warnock and sen. david perdue, r-ga., takes on jon ossoff.\n\nboth ossoff and warnock are making pledges of not just embracing and adopting the green new deal, which would destroy our economy, but also make us less secure on the global stage by relying on other nations for our energy, gidley said on sunday.\n\nthey want to open our borders. they want to make puerto rico a state, d.c. a state, pack the court, all the agenda items that have been radical from the beginning that have been exposed, they are embracing and promising to do.\n\nhe went on to say that president trump is therefore going to go and campaign in georgia on monday for the republican senators and rally his supporters and say, 'guys, we are still looking at what happened in this reelection campaign for me. don't worry about that. what you need to make sure you do and focus on is getting out the vote for kelly loeffler and perdue to make sure we control the senate.'\n\ni think it's a pretty good message and i think it's one that's going to work in the state of georgia, gidley continued.\n\nwhen trump weighed in on the 2017 race, calling ossoff a super liberal democrat who wanted to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes, ossoff responded that the president was misinformed.\n\nwisconsin supreme court tosses trump campaign lawsuit\n\ni'm focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability and bipartisan problem solving to washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro atlanta's economy into the silicon valley of the south, ossoff said.\n\nossoff distanced himself from the national democratic party's lurch to the left at the time. the atlanta journal-constitution said ossoff often tried to avoid nationalizing that campaign over fears of losing moderate voters.\n\nhe said he would not support any tax increases, even on the wealthy. i don't support any increase in income tax rates, he said.\n\nlast month, loeffler painted her jan. 5 runoff election against warnock as a battle against socialism during an interview on fox news' sunday morning futures.\n\nloeffler tied her opponent to ideas touted by the more progressive wing of the democratic party, including cutting funding to police departments and the so-called green new deal. she also linked warnock to former cuban strongman fidel castro.\n\nin 1995, warnock was a youth pastor at abyssinian baptist church in harlem, where castro gave a speech during a trip to the united states to attend the united nations general assembly. warnock's campaign claims he had no role in the decision to host castro.\n\non sunday, loeffler also warned that democratic victories in her state's runoff elections will mean a radical agenda that will drastically change life in the u.s.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nrepublicans currently hold 50 seats versus 48 for the democrats. if democrats pick up both seats, they will take control of the upper chamber, with vice president-elect kamala harris casting tie-breaking votes.\n\nfox news' morgan phillips, ronn blitzer and andrew o'reilly contributed to this report.

the early days of 2019 have not treated president trump well.\n\nthe federal government is nearing the second week of the partial shutdown, republicans are about to lose their unified government, and americans are increasingly turning against the president.\n\nin a poll released last week by reuters/ipsos, 47 percent of americans blame president trump, over the democrats, for the shutdown. with frustrations increasing, and democratic energy at an all-time high after the historic midterm election results, the president has been backed into a corner.\n\nclick here to read more from doug schoen: trump is to blame for government shutdown, but border security is important\n\nthe democrats, who will regain the majority in the house of representatives on january 3, have already begun planning how they will come out of this issue on top.\n\nrecognizing the importance of reopening the government, they have now proposed a plan that would deal with six out of the seven appropriations bills, leaving only the department of homeland security with a continuing resolution.\n\nas of now, this looks like the best option. however, it looks like this still will not be enough for president trump.\n\npresident trump is still demanding that the democrats provide the full $5 billion he has requested to build a wall, something that democrat leaders are refusing to provide. the presumptive speaker of the house, nancy pelosi, and senate minority leader, chuck schumer, have agreed to provide $1.3 billion for additional border security.\n\nif i could speak directly to the president i would say to him, mr. president: take their deal.\n\nas americans have become increasingly frustrated with the government over the shutdown, and eyes are turning toward president trump as the main person to blame, it is more important now than ever before that he take this deal and declare victory for additional border security.\n\nthe president should also take this deal because it is becoming increasingly obvious that the issue of the wall is no longer a selling point for voters. yes, there is the need for additional border security, but the issue of building the wall only motivates the president's base. and that base is growing increasingly narrow as the president's approval rating, according to the realclearpolitics, is now below 43 percent. playing to the base is an increasingly bad strategy for him going into 2020.\n\nelection results from the 2018 midterm elections should be a warning for republicans: if they want to win in 2020 they will need to back away from the hardline issues like building a wall that are clearly not working.\n\ndespite the inability to find common ground to end this shutdown, there is still a great deal of work to be done in washington.\n\nthe democratic wins across the country in the 2018 midterm elections made one thing abundantly clear: americans want action on the most pressing issues. we must shift the focus of the debate not just to keeping the government open, but fixing issues with infrastructure, health care, and, dare i say, comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nwhile it might appear outlandish that in this current government there could be something like bipartisan reform, the recent criminal justice reform bill shows that common ground can still be found.\n\nthe democrats are in the best position to bring about change because of decisive victories in traditionally red states and districts that make it increasingly clear that the republican agenda is not resonating with voters.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nadditionally, with democrats now about to take control of the house of representatives, cooperation with them is going to be more important than ever for republican leaders.\n\nfor president trump, the solution is simple. take the $1.3 billion and call it a victory for border security. bipartisanship is going to be increasingly important in 2019, and if president trump fails to deliver, it leaves the door wide open for the democrats in 2020.\n\nclick here to read more from doug schoen

west virginia coach neal brown knew he would use reserve quarterback austin kendall in the second half. the redshirt senior ended up leading the moutaineers to a liberty bowl victory.\n\nkendall threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to t.j. simmons with 5:10 left, and west virginia held off army 24-21 on thursday.\n\nbrown said the decision to switch quarterbacks was made at halftime by the mountaineers coaching staff after starter jarret doege struggled, particularly in the second quarter.\n\nclick here for more sports coverage on foxnews.com\n\njarret has played very, very well all year, but for whatever reason, he didn't see it well, brown said, adding: i thought (kendall) came in in relief and did a nice job.\n\narmy (9-3) had a chance to tie it with 1:50 left, but quinn maretzki's 39-yard field goal was wide left. josh chandler ended army's final possession with an interception and led the mountaineers (6-4) with 13 tackles.\n\nsimmons also scored on a 5-yard pass from doege.\n\narmy quarterback tyhier tyler had three rushing touchdowns — from 1, 6, and 2 yards — to tie a liberty bowl record.\n\nyou can't do anything without the offensive line, the slotbacks and the fullbacks, tyler said. they pave the way, and i just follow.\n\nthe black knights initially were scheduled to play in the independence bowl but seemed left out of the bowl lineup after the shreveport, louisiana, bowl was canceled. they got the opportunity to play in the liberty bowl after tennessee (3-7) opted out because of covid-19 cases.\n\nthe game was played in overcast conditions with occasional showers and sub-40-degree temperatures. the weather and local covid-19 restrictions limited the crowd in the 60,000-seat liberty bowl memorial stadium, leaving clusters of the announced 8,187 fans scattered throughout the stadium.\n\nboth team controlled the other's offense through much of the first half. army coach jeff monken noted that his team, one of the best rushing teams in the country, was limited to 83 total yards by halftime.\n\nwest virginia just whipped blocks, they beat blocks, monken said. (they) got themselves where they needed to be to make the play. and they did that a lot.\n\nwhat began as a defensive battle, changed after halftime. army's rushing offense got untracked, while a change in quarterbacks to kendall for west virginia gave it more firepower through the air.\n\ni thought this game kind of mirrored 2020 in a lot of ways, brown said. a fitting way to close out the year. it wasn't a thing of beauty, but it was gritty.\n\nthe takeaway\n\narmy: the black knights' vaunted rushing offense couldn't move early, not picking up their initial first down until the final play of the opening quarter. eventually, they had some success attacking the perimeter of the west virginia defense.\n\nwest virginia: while the defense controlled things early, the mountaineers couldn't capitalize enough to build a significant lead. turnovers hurt west virginia, especially doege's fumble deep in his own territory late in the first half, giving army a lead. kendall taking over at quarterback made a difference as he threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in the second half.\n\ndown players\n\narmy was down eight players who did not dress for the game, many of them key parts of the team, because of health and safety protocol.\n\ni don't know if it changed, monken said. obviously, when you have players that are a big part of your offense and defense, kicking game included, it changes you some.\n\ndisappointing end\n\nthe loss snapped the black knights three-game winning streak. the most painful aspect is just not being finish it, linebacker arik smith said. being that close and not being able to finish it. but we will regroup and do this again, and we will win.\n\nup next:\n\narmy: the black knights , who ended the regular season on a three-game winning streak, will try and continue its winning ways. there are 17 seniors listed on the army roster, but four of the five offensive line starters are seniors.\n\nwest virginia: while the mountaineers lost four games during the regular season, three of those were to teams nationally ranked at the time. with key offensive players such as doege and leading rusher leddie brown with another years of eligibility along with a young corps of receivers, the mountaineers have a nice future on offense.

rep.-elect lauren boebert, r-colo., wrote a letter to house leadership friday, urging them to keep a 1967 rule that exempts lawmakers from a ban on firearms inside the capitol building.\n\nthe letter, which was signed by 82 other current and incoming gop congress members -- including dan crenshaw, mo brooks, louie gohmert and matt gaetz -- came three days after 21 democratic lawmakers asked house speaker nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy to change the 53-year-old rule to keep boebert from carrying her gun into work.\n\non saturday, it appeared boebert scored a victory, as new rules unveiled by house speaker nancy pelosi did not appear to include a democrat-proposed ban on firearms in the capitol.\n\ni refuse to give up my second amendment rights, boebert said in a statement last week. i'm a 5-foot tall, 100-pound mom with four children and will be walking to work and serving in one of the most dangerous cities in the u.s. i choose to defend my family and my life with all of the force the constitution provides. i will not let a bunch of gun-grabbing house democrats take away my constitutional right to protect myself.\n\nthe letter sent by democrats said allowing lawmakers to carry guns in the capitol creates needless risk for members of congress, their staff, members of the capitol police, and visitors to the capitol grounds.\n\nrep.-elect lauren boebert blasts democrats for trying to ban her from carrying gun at capitol\n\nthe democratic letter was led by reps. jared huffman, robin kelly and jackie speier.

before he begins a three-year prison sentence for lying to the internal revue services about the taxes he owed, lying to financial institutions and lying to congress, michael cohen – president trump's former personal attorney – is scheduled to testify about trump at a congressional hearing feb. 7.\n\nanti-trump democrats and others who hate the president are sure to love cohen's testimony. while cohen said in 2017 that he would take a bullet to protect trump, that turned out to be yet another lie.\n\nit turns out cohen secretly recorded phone calls with trump – hardly ethical behavior for a lawyer dealing with a client. and he has spent over 70 hours talking with federal prosecutors in new york city and from the office of special counsel robert mueller about his own crimes and making allegations of wrongdoing by president trump.\n\nhans von spakovsky: former election commissioner: cohen and trump didn't violate campaign finance law\n\ntrump opponents can be sure that if cohen goes ahead with plans to testify before the house oversight and reform committee his words will be music to their ears.\n\nonce demonized by the anti-trump crowd, cohen has since been embraced by many of his former critics for turning on his former boss, who provided him with a paycheck for 12 years until they parted ways last year.\n\nbut with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word cohen says regarding trump or anything else?\n\nrep. elijah cummings, d-md., will preside over the hearing where cohen testifies. now that democrats are the majority party in the house, they have promised to aggressively investigate the president's activities in the private sector, in his personal life and in government.\n\ncohen himself issued an unintentionally ironic statement about his upcoming testimony, blithely asserting that he looked forward to having a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\n\nthis from a man already convicted of lying to congress – among other felonies.\n\ncan we really expect a full and credible account from michael cohen? or will his testimony be just another piece in what acting u.s. attorney robert khuzami of the southern district of new york called cohen's pattern of deception, designed to make himself look good and to shift blame for his misdeeds onto the president?\n\nkhuzami has described cohen as someone who repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends. cohen's illegal conduct was marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life and he engaged in extensive, deliberate, and serious criminal conduct, according to khuzami\n\nbut with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word cohen says regarding trump or anything else?\n\ncohen pleaded guilty in federal court to willful tax evasion, false statements to financial institutions, illegal campaign contributions, and making false statements to congress. khuzami noted that all of the crimes bore a common set of characteristics. each involved deception that was motivated by personal greed and ambition.\n\nin his testimony scheduled for feb. 7, cohen will swear an oath to tell the truth. but he previously swore – falsely and repeatedly – that the tax returns he submitted to the irs were true and accurate.\n\nkhuzami faulted cohen for his submissions to prosecutors in which cohen repeatedly attempted to minimize the seriousness of his decision not to report millions of dollars of income over a period of years by blaming his accountant – assertions that prosecutors said are simply false.\n\ndo we have any reason to expect cohen to change his stripes when he comes before congress next month?\n\ncohen didn't lie to just the irs and prosecutors. khuzami's sentencing memorandum noted that cohen told numerous financial institutions a long-series of self-serving lies about his assets and liabilities.\n\nwell, at least cohen's behavior is consistent!\n\ncohen previously lied to congress about a real estate deal in russia that the trump organization had been negotiating for 30 years. nothing about the deal itself was unlawful, but cohen's ham-handed lies seemed intended to minimize the fact that he was still discussing this deal during the first half of 2016.\n\nnow that the house oversight committee is run by democrats, cohen has every incentive to shift the blame for this potentially embarrassing deal to president trump. he probably has little fear that democrats would want to see him prosecuted for misrepresenting what happened – as long as it advances their narrative that donald trump is guilty of something.\n\nthis is because congressional democrats aren't really interested in michael cohen. they're interested in using michael cohen to make accusations of wrongdoing against president trump.\n\nthere's no doubt that cohen will be asked about the hush-money payments he made to two women in exchange for not making public their unproven allegations – denied by trump – of extramarital affairs that supposedly occurred many years before trump ran for president.\n\ncohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws by making these payments. but as i have explained before, many campaign finance experts and former members of the federal election commission do not believe that the payments actually broke any federal law. as a former member of the federal elections commission and an attorney who has worked extensively on election law issues i share this view.\n\nyet even in arranging the payments to the two women, the sentencing memorandum notes, cohen used sophisticated tactics to conceal his misconduct. and when news stories about the payments began to surface, the memorandum says cohen responded by telling shifting and misleading stories.\n\nif members of the house oversight committee want to know why michael cohen has embraced a pattern of deception they should be sure to read the last part of the sentencing memorandum. khuzami says cohen's behavior was driven by his own ambition and greed.\n\noriginally, cohen expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new (trump) administration, according to the memorandum. when that didn't materialize, he successfully convinced numerous major corporations to retain him as a 'consultant' who could provide unique insights about and access to the new administration.\n\nthat turned out to be a lie as well. khuzami notes that although cohen made more than $4 million as a consultant, he provided little or no real services.\n\nthe sentencing memorandum adds this kicker: cohen undertook similar acts of deception in his private life.\n\nkhuzami summed it up this way: cohen's consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting … his remorse is minimal, and … his instinct to blame others is strong.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nand this is the witness chairman cummings can't wait to put on

One of the most powerful Democratic City Council members in Chicago has been charged with extortion, accused of trying to shake down a fast-food restaurant seeking remodeling permits, said a federal complaint unsealed Thursday.\n\nAlderman Ed Burke, 75, is charged with one count of attempted extortion for conveying to company executives of a Burger King in 2017 that they'd get the permits if they signed on as clients at his private property tax law firm, the 37-page complaint said.\n\nA conviction carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBurke made an initial appearance on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago. A preliminary hearing is set for the afternoon of Jan 18.\n\nThe Democrat's law firm, Klafter & Burke, represented the high-rise tower that bears President Trump's name. There's no indication the case is at all tied to his firm's work for Trump.\n\nKlafter & Burke specializes in property tax appeals, and its former clients included Trump's luxury tower in downtown Chicago.\n\nNewly elected Rep. Jesus Chuy Garcia and other Burke critics in Chicago's Hispanic community have drawn attention to that tax work in a bid to hurt Burke politically.\n\nBurke joins a long list of Chicago lawmakers charged criminally, including former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a 14-year prison term on multiple federal corruption convictions.\n\nBurke has been on the council in Chicago for 50 years and has chaired its finance committee for the last three decades, Fox 32 reported.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune added that Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said it's unacceptable for Burke to continue in his role as chairman of the finance committee; a vote to force him out may take place at the City Council's next meeting Jan. 23.\n\nBurke's wife, Anne, is an Illinois Supreme Court justice. His father also was influential in Democratic circles in Chicago until his death in the 1960s. Other Burke relatives also have been involved in Illinois politics.\n\nSince the 1970s, nearly three dozen aldermen have been convicted. A common joke in Chicago is that so many aldermen had gone to prison that when they saw each other behind bars they'd holler, Quorum call!\n\nBurke is associated by Chicagoans with insider benefits long accorded alderman. A city inspectors report in 2016 found snow removal crews plowed the street where he lived far more often than other streets after a 2015 storm. They worked his street 46 times in five days, the report said.\n\nCHICAGO REDUCES MURDER RATE IN 2018 BUT STILL OUSTRIPS LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK COMBINED\n\nBurke said after FBI raids on his offices at City Hall and in his Southwest Side ward in November that he was sure agents wouldn't find anything amiss.\n\nThe complaint, which did not identify the fast-food company or the executives allegedly squeezed, included excerpts from wiretaps of Burke's phone and emails seized in the raids.\n\nWhen the executives didn't give Burke's law firm the business he wanted, Burke spoke with one of his ward employees about how they would play hard ball with the company, the complaint said.\n\nFox News' Jim Murphy and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
House Democrats are working on legislation that would permanently expand the child tax credit to provide thousands per year per child to tens of millions of Americans in the form of monthly recurring payments.\n\nUnder the American Family Act, tax credits would be fully refundable and the IRS would send $300 monthly checks for families with a child under 6 and $250 payments for children between 6 and 17. That would amount to $3,600 per year for children under 6 and $3,000 for older children.\n\nReps. Suzanne Delbene, D-Wash., and Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., are working on introducing the bill, according to The Hill.\n\nSQUAD MEMBERS URGE BIDEN TO COMMUTE THE SENTENCES OF DEATH ROW INMATES\n\nThe bill was introduced in the last Congress and earned the support of 38 of 47 Democrats and 187 of 232 House Democrats. President Biden has since out in support of an expansion of the tax credit as part of a coronavirus relief package, but only for one year.\n\nA one-year expansion would cost about $120 billion, according to the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Republicans are generally expected to oppose the measure due to its price tag.\n\nReps. DelBene and DeLauro are planning to reintroduce the American Family Act soon. We are currently working through technical changes to the bill, including discussions with the Biden administration on how this would be implemented to get benefits to families quickly and efficiently, Nick Martin, a DelBene spokesperson, said.\n\nOMAR CALLS ON BIDEN TO BACK 'RECURRING CASH PAYMENTS'\n\nThe president's support for this policy is a game-changer. The one-year expansion is important pandemic relief policy but permanently expanding the benefit could give millions of children the opportunity to succeed. The permanent expansion is estimated to lift 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half, he added.\n\nThe current child tax credit is up to $2,000 per child 16 and under, and it reduces taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis rather than in the form of a check. Up to $1,400 of the Child Tax Credit is refundable, meaning if taxes are reduced to zero for lower-income families they can get a refund on what is left over.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe credit phases out for single parents who make over $200,000 or couples who make over $400,000. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. Such changes were pushed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
In just one day, the fate of the Senate -- and the nation -- will be decided by Georgia voters. While the ballots and votes cast will determine if Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue deserve to be re-elected -- and it's undeniably clear that they do -- the Georgia runoff elections have far greater implications.\n\nIn the first two years of President Barack Obama's first term, we watched as a unified Congress controlled by Democrats rammed through ObamaCare and other liberal pieces of legislation, confirmed radical nominees to critical executive branch positions and promulgated progressive regulations that harmed our economy and our workers.\n\nRepublicans in Congress were powerless to stop this liberal assault on our values and institutions.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2010 elections — when I first ran for Senate — when Americans overwhelmingly rejected Obama's agenda and took back control of the House that Republicans in Congress could prevent further damage.\n\nSEN. DAVID PERDUE: GEORGIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR ME & SEN. LOEFFLER TO STOP DEMS' RADICAL SOCIALIST AGENDA\n\nIf Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in the Georgia runoff elections on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will have the power to enact the radical left's socialist agenda that has become mainstream in today's Democratic Party. The Green New Deal, socialized medicine with care decided by unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, European-style taxes on American industry and workers, radical regulations that will harm small businesses, and capitulation to the Chinese Communist Party will all be on the agenda.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSince President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Republicans in Congress have worked with the administration to pass historic tax cuts for workers, families, and small businesses.\n\nWe have made progress in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its continued assault on American workers and businesses. And we have confirmed a new generation of well-qualified nominees to our nation's judicial system who believe in the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nOf course, the legacy media would have every American believe that the last four years have been a disaster. But no amount of hit pieces, negative articles, or tirades from cable news anchors can erase what our strong, conservative Republican majority has been able to accomplish.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGeorgia voters are quite literally our nation's last line of defense in protecting this legacy.\n\nOn January 5th, the entire nation will be watching. If Georgians believe in our democracy and our nation's institutions, they will reject Warnock and Ossoff. And in so doing, they will give Senate Republicans the power to prevent the socialist onslaught that the radical left is actively planning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. MARCO RUBIO
There are a lot of questions awaiting President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in his scheduled appearance Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nHowever, the most immediate question will be whether Cohen's taking of the oath to testify will be followed by the usual comedic two drums and a cymbal riff. After a long and documented history as a liar and felon, Cohen's taking of any oath deserves proper musical accompaniment.\n\nNevertheless, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is right to call Cohen to testify. And to their credit, Republicans in the Senate are also considering calling Cohen before he goes off to prison.\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY: COHEN LIED, BROKE THE LAW AND USED TRUMP TO GET RICH --AND NOW BLAMES TRUMP FOR HIS TROUBLES\n\nCohen is not the first thoroughly discredited person to testify before Congress. The list ranges from mobster Frank Costello and quiz show fraud Charles Van Doren in the 1950s to drug gouger Martin Shkreli in 2016.\n\nHowever, even liars can supply details of criminal conduct. Now that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail. Moreover, the public has the right to see Cohen examined on those details and his own credibility in making these allegations.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in federal court in August to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. He said the campaign finance violation involved a payment made during Trump's presidential campaign to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in return for her agreement not to publicize her allegation that she had an extramarital affair with Trump years earlier.\n\nCohen said he was directed by Trump to make the payment to Daniels. The president has denied he had an affair with Daniels and denied any wrongdoing regarding the payment.\n\nIn addition, Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016. No deal was reached on building the tower.\n\nNow that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail.\n\nCohen is heading to prison as a result of his guilty pleas – but not for as long as he deserves. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III called Cohen's history a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct and said each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors denounced Cohen as a manipulating liar with a long history of being a legal thug. Yet Pauley gave Cohen an extremely generous deal of just three years in prison. It was not half of what he deserved, but Cohen has lived his life from one scam to another.\n\nCohen is likely to try to portray himself now as a redemptive sinner – an act that is almost an affront to sin. For those who have long been critics of his infamous career (and the failure of the New York Bar to take action against him), the act will be as infuriating as it is unbelievable.\n\nCohen made himself rich victimizing more vulnerable people. In 2015, when Harvard Lampoon staffers played a prank on Trump by having him sit in the stolen president's chair from the Harvard Crimson for a photo and an endorsement, Cohen threatened the students with ruin.\n\nCohen was quoted by a student on the Harvard Lampoon staff as saying: I'm gonna come up to Harvard. You're all gonna get expelled. If this photo gets out, you'll be outta that school faster than you know it. I can be up there tomorrow.\n\nWhile some reporters are actively rehabilitating Cohen now that he is a foe to President Trump, Cohen previously lied to and threatened journalists on behalf of Trump. When former Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak wrote about a biography that included allegations from Trump's first wife, Ivana, that Trump raped her, Cohen did not hesitate to attack.\n\nIn a phone call recorded by Mak, Cohen told the reporter: You're talking about Donald Trump, you're talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, a presidential candidate, as well as private individual, who never raped anybody and, of course, understand that by the very definition you can't rape your spouse.\n\nAs a matter of law, it is a crime to rape anyone – including a spouse.\n\nCohen added in the recorded call: Mark my words for it, I will make sure that you and I meet ne day over in the courthouse and I will take you for every penny you still don't have, and I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else.\n\nSo why would anyone want to hear anything from a guy who couldn't lie straight in bed? Because Trump selected Cohen to be his lawyer and employed him from 2006 until last year. Cohen served as a vice president of The Trump Organization and later as Trump's personal attorney.\n\nMore importantly, Cohen's allegations concerning the payoffs have some independent corroboration. Hush-money payments were made to Daniels and to another woman alleging an affair with Trump. Other people have reportedly supported the account that the payment to Daniels was made to suppress news that could have hurt Trump's chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump picked not just Cohen but Paul Manafort – two of the deepest bottom feeders in the New York-Washington corridor. (Manafort served as chairman of the Trump presidential campaign and was convicted in August of eight charges of tax and bank fraud unrelated to his work on the Trump campaign. He also pleaded guilty in September to two conspiracy charges.)\n\nThis is the cost of such poor judgment by Trump regarding the people he has hired.\n\nThat does not make the payments a clear criminal act. As I have previously stated, there are strong defenses that Trump can raise over his motivations in the payments. Such a violation would ordinarily be handled as a civil matter with a fine rather than with a criminal charge.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that the allegations are not serious. Last year, I wrote columns saying that the payoffs represented the greatest threat to this White House and that Trump was facing an existential threat by keeping Cohen as his lawyer.\n\nObviously, anything Cohen says in his congressional testimony will have to be accepted with an asterisk denoting the sources as a serial liar. However, truth can sometimes be mined from a sinkhole of lies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWill Cohen testify truthfully before Congress? It's impossible to say but it would be an exercise of hope over experience.\n\nWe need to have that truth. The cost is dealing with disreputable individuals like Cohen. In this case, we might want to proceed under President Reagan's famous pledge to trust but verify. With Cohen, however, I recommend dropping the trust part.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E California Route 1 is living up to its road trip-inspired name.\n\nThe mid-level model of the electric SUV has earned a 305-mile range from the EPA, which is more than any other Mach-E. Just.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive vehicle comes with the largest battery pack available, a special set of aerodynamic wheels and a few other tweaks to help improve its efficiency over the Mach-E Premium, which is rated at 300 miles in the same configuration. The California Route 1 is more powerful, however, with a 290 hp motor to the Premium's 266 hp unit.\n\nThe California Route 1 starts at $50,900 and the Premium at $53,100, but both qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Subtracting that brings the California Route 1 down to $43,400. The lowest-priced Tesla Model Y is currently the Rear-Wheel Drive Standard Range version, which delivers a 244-mile range for $43,190.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, a cruise up the California coast can be a lot longer than that. A trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco on Route 1 running over 450 miles, which would require one stop for charging. According to Ford, the Mach-E's pack can be filled to 80 percent in about 45 minutes at a public DC fast charging station.
It is doubtful that the House and Senate could tackle the next COVID-19 package until the first week of March, Fox News has learned. But, the process to put a COVID relief measure on the floors of both the House and Senate begins next week.\n\nHere's the problem: How does the Senate move such a measure (still unwritten) and avoid a filibuster? That requires 60 yeas. Moreover, how do Democrats advance a plan in a 50/50 Senate? The answer is budget reconciliation. It is an arcane, one-year fiscal process that curbs debate in the Senate to only 20 hours. No filibusters allowed. And it only needs 51 votes to pass.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS ON DEMS GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH WITH FILIBUSTER: 'DAMN RIGHT WE WILL'\n\nFox News has learned that the House Budget Committee will prepare a budget vehicle on Feb. 1. The measure would likely go to the House floor on Feb. 3. This vehicle is the essential first step. You can't do the substance of the coronavirus bill unless you have the reconciliation vehicle that allows the Senate to consider the actual package under these special rules.\n\nFox is told the Senate will likely move its budget reconciliation vehicle on Feb. 5.\n\nIn other words, this is the bus that will hold contents of the next COVID package -- and allow it to bypass filibusters.\n\nSANDERS THREATENS TO ADVANCE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS WITH RECONCILIATION IF REPUBLICANS REFUSE SUPPORT\n\nFox News is told it will still take a couple of weeks to get the next coronavirus bill together, and that will likely hit the first week of March. But it could go earlier if the measure is ready.\n\nDemocrats used budget reconciliation to pass ObamaCare in 2010 because they couldn't get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans unsuccessfully used reconciliation to try to do undo ObamaCare. And, Republicans also used reconciliation to approve tax reform.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans have not yet received their $600 stimulus checks that were approved as part of the $900 billion relief package passed in December. Most Americans received $1,200 stimulus checks as part of the first relief bill back in April.\n\nFox News' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, February 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Malignant dictatorships we've hated in our foreign policy since WWII. Unfortunately you're insane Alec. We'll always seek the truth, we'll never be the media mob.\n\nPlease set your DVR every night. Let not your heart be troubled because Laura Ingraham's here. Hi.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, I'm always glad when that dry ice special effect comes up and I'm not the villain of the day. I'm always happy.\n\nHANNITY: Come on really?\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: All right, so you really think that one day I'm going to choose you as the--\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: You believe that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes and then I'll make sure just let's cut corners, at least my staff will get to pitch fork and everything.\n\nHANNITY: If you do something that deserves it, that's it. You're going to be middle of the day but you're going to have to earn it. Alec Baldwin's tough to beat.\n\nINGRAHAM: But Hannity, I want to actually get real dry ice for your studio. I mean if you're going to do it, you got to do it right.\n\nHANNITY: You want like a concert.\n\nINGRAHAM: You got a fancy set up over there. I want the flames and the - I want the whole deal OK?\n\nHANNITY: You have the fanciest set up - you have as fancy a set up as I do. You have the same exact fancy.\n\nINGRAHAM: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I love our set. I'm not going to say anything else. We have a great set here. Tech people, you know the people when you ski, you go skiing, you don't ski but I'll just tell you the--\n\nHANNITY: These sets cost millions of dollars to build these things.\n\nINGRAHAM: Listen when someone goes skiing, right? And they have that $1000 pair of skis, it's fun to be on a pair of really old you know, old dogs on your feet and then you go whizzing right by because people are really nice studios. Then you have a rudimentary studio and you're number one. You're number one.\n\nHANNITY: Something like that. Whatever you say. I don't care.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hannity have a great night.\n\nHANNITY: Have a good show.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from DC tonight. The Left is so overcome with their zeal to eject Trump from office that they're abandoning all their supposed principles to back perhaps a plutocrat like Mike Bloomberg. No. But will he sell out America to China?\n\nMy Angle explains how he might already have done it and speaking of Mini Mike, despite his old thoughts on stop and frisk resurfacing. We're hearing those tapes, the mayor made a pitch to black voters in Houston tonight. Did it work?\n\nWell, we sent a special guest inside and he went into the event. You know who it is. I'm not going to tell you who it is. Oh, you see him on the screen. Dinesh D'Souza. Already shock. I wanted you to have a little trick there. All right, the exclusive video that we got ahead.\n\nPlus, we were the only show to report on that deranged leftist who drove a van into a Trump voter registration tent in Florida and we have an important update on that story for you tonight.\n\nBut first, the big news today was Bill Barr defending decision to scale back Roger Stone's outrageous sentencing recommendation. Earlier today, the Attorney General told ABC news this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I first saw the news reports, I said, gee, the news is spinning this. This is not what we were going to do.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you were surprised?\n\nBARR: I was very surprised. I said that night to my staff that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to a man that can clarify what our position was. I had made a decision that I thought was fair and reasonable in this particular case.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now Barr's right of course. Whatever your feelings about Roger Stone, he doesn't deserve nearly a decade in jail for lying about activity that's not even illegal. And on top of that Stone is 67 years old and has no criminal history.\n\nBut the media they're not interested in that part of the interview. No. Facts and details bore the chattering class. They unsurprisingly found this to be the big takeaway.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARR: To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Ah ha, a comment that almost everyone in Trump's orbit has said before is suddenly the new bomb shell.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: News here from what can only be described now as the besieged Attorney General of the United States.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In his warped imagination, this is a terrible disloyal thing to do and these people must be punished.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does Bill Barr have enough goodwill with the President and political capital that he can do something like this and get away with it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He fired Sessions after almost two full years of simmering. We might get Barr leaving on his own.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: She always looks happy but like so many others, they misread what's really going on. The White House released a statement shortly after the interview reading in part, the President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right just like any other American citizen to publicly offer his opinions.\n\nThe president has full faith and confidence in AG Barr to do his job and uphold the law. The White House denial second matter to Democrat so they're going to still try to use the Stone case to make up for their embarrassing impeachment failure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Something egregious like this demands that the Inspector General investigate.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What Barr has done should mean that we are demanding a resignation. In effect, I won't resign from the House should start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Attorney General William Barr ought to be ashamed and be embarrassed and resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And the media playing right along.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's almost every big decision that is coming through the Justice Department now has to be sent through the White House and checkout with the President and then do what the President - to the President bidding. We've never - we didn't see that in Watergate. This is why this is more sinister.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It always goes back to being more sinister than Watergate. I mean they just have stock phrases. They just pull them off the shelf and spit him out on TV. Joining me now, John Eastman, Clairemont Institute Senior Fellow, constitutional scholar and Darrell Issa, former Chair of the House Oversight Committee that oversees the DOJ.\n\nAll right John, the media sees the sexy story of Trump versus Barr but they miss the fact that Barr was basically telling Trump, don't worry I got this.\n\nJOHN EASTMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE: I got this and you know, the Democrats to seem to overlook article two of the constitution. The executive powers vested in the President.\n\nThe top law enforcement officer is the Attorney General. If he wants to counteract decisions of the line prosecutor, that is their job. There's nothing wrong with this. And what was wrong with it is the egregious you know, pre-dawn raid on Roger Stone and throwing the book at this guy because they don't like his politics.\n\nINGRAHAM: And I have to say this Congressman Issa, that tweeting about a pending case, John and I know this, you know this, it is going to be a problematic thing because it's not - it's not going to necessarily affect any outcome nor should it.\n\nHowever, it does put the Attorney General in a bit of a pickle, does it not? Because then - wait a second - he's pressured. He wasn't pressured. He's doing what he thought was right but hence, the tweet hangs out over his shoulder and it makes it a little trickier for him.\n\nSo I do get that point.\n\nDARRELL ISSA (R-CA), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Well, you know there's been no communicator in our history like Donald Trump and President Trump's need and desire and effectiveness to say what people are thinking including the unfair treatment of Roger Stone.\n\nTo be honest Trump's all these other things so yes, I understand how every member of the cabinet would prefer to have the Chief Executive just say, you've got this but in some cases like Eddie Gallagher who was unfairly treated, the navy seals or in the case of Roger Stone, the President having an opinion and if appropriate, the President using his ability to give clemency or pardoning, those are his rights.\n\nAnd so I don't think there's any question and I don't see a rift between the Attorney General and the President. Just the opposite. I see the Attorney General doing what he needs to do and not being afraid to say that the line attorneys and by the way, a very questionable federal judge in Amy Berman Jackson, you might remember, she's the one that gave Eric Holder, an extra two years to slow walk, fast and furious.\n\nI don't blame the President for doing what he's doing which is communicating to American people because they want to hear it now.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, John again, it's just so you - remind everyone what happened here. Roger Stone, the jury foreman, Tomeka Hart who is in the Roger Stone jury called Roger Stone, racist, pre-trial. Called Trump supporters, racist. Likened Trump to the KKK. The foreperson on the jury praised the Mueller investigation and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat.\n\nNow is there a reason the President should be unhappy about this?\n\nEASTMAN: Yes and in fact she lied in her - to the judge when she said she had no really - hadn't been following the Miller investigation. She had been tweeting about it the whole time. Look, there's another thing aspect of this and that's the gross double standard. President Obama gives a speech, exonerating Hillary Clinton before her Department of Justice lawyers do anything with Hillary Clinton and nobody's talking about that.\n\nTrump tweets out something on a decision that's already going to be made and all of a sudden, it's a new impeachable offense. I mean this is laughable.\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, I don't remember the media getting all bent out of shape when Obama weighed in on a myriad of legal cases.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The police acted stupidly.\n\nIf I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know about Hillary Clinton's use of private email server?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: While she was Secretary of State?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it posed a national security problem?\n\nOBAMA: I don't think it posed a national security problem.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember that Congressman, you were in Congress when Obama was doing all this.\n\nEASTMAN: The double standards.\n\nISSA: Exactly, the double standard and by the way the double standard for Eric Holder. They clearly got away with this, you know Clapper and Comey and plenty of people have lied to Congress and have not been held accountable.\n\nYou know I'm on the campaign trail and everyday people ask me one thing, which is you know, you were effective chairman. You held these people accountable but nothing happened. The fact is under the last administration, they made sure that none of the people who lied to Congress, none of the people who did much worse things were actually prosecuted.\n\nEven Eric Holder who was referred for criminal contempt, the President bailed him out by claiming executive privilege only to later admit that those documents were never privileged documents but that's - that's forgotten by the so-called mainstream media and it's something that President Trump is not going to fail to say in real time because the American people need to hear it in real.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, speaking of which I want to show everybody this. You were talking about Eric Holder, former AG for Obama. This is what he had to say about Barr in a tweet. He said, Do not underestimate the danger of the situation. The political appointees and the DOJ are involving themselves in an appropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President. This affects the rule of law and respect for it. Unprecedented. John.\n\nEASTMAN: Unprecedented except for what he did when he was head of the DOJ. He launched the most political efforts in the Department of Justice in our nation's history. He was cited for contempt of Congress, the first attorney General.\n\nINGRAHAM: Fast and furious.\n\nEASTMAN: Yes. Fast and furious for lying to Congress, for withholding documents without a bases and a privilege and he politicized every aspect of the Department of Justice.\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember when he did his first speech to the employees of the Department of Justice, let's see, a little quiz on the Ingraham Angle. You know what his first speech was to the employees?\n\nEASTMAN: I don't.\n\nINGRAHAM: We're a nation of cowards.\n\nEASTMAN: Oh, that's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: On the issue of race.\n\nEASTMAN: That's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was all about race and how the country's initiative - so that's how he introduced himself to the department.\n\nEASTMAN: Right and worse, they got a lot of those guys in his political appointees and then they converted them to career appointees who are still there in the deep state, working against the elected president.\n\nINGRAHAM: Congressman, how concerned are you that some of these same people are still burrowed in at DOJ and in agencies like the National Security Council.\n\nISSA: Well, I'm not just concerned that national security is - it's very clear that people see it. But the DOJ, I'm very concerned. You know, I talked to border patrol agents, rank and file, all the way up to their heads and they're frustrated that they're still being thwarted to do their job by those very people that were left embedded.\n\nYou know, one of the other things that Eric Holder should be remembered for, he came before Congress and asked about being the Chief Law Enforcement. He looked us in the eye and he said I wear two hats and in follow up, it became clear the two hats he wears, one is the chief law enforcement.\n\nThe other is a political appointee of President Obama.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nISSA: That's something that Bill Barr never said and if he had said it, the Senate would have - the Democrats in the Senate would have had a hay day and yet openly, Eric Holder thought he was a political appointee and acted like one.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, all right gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see both of you tonight and the President today lambasted the lead juror in that case as I mentioned earlier. It looks like she did hide her anti-Trump bias during jury selection in the Roger Stone case.\n\nBut have no fear because the media quickly rode in to her defense.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was so struck by the President going after the foreperson on that jury today because you know, this is someone who has done their civic duty.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see him interfering today, chastising the jurors in the Roger Stone case.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His allies are waging a war against the jury itself who convicted Roger Stone.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has also attacked a Roger Stone juror, that's an American citizen, alleging without evidence, significant biased.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're seeing jury nullification at a presidential level.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. General Whitaker, was Trump justified in being outraged about this juror?\n\nMATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: Yes, this is an extraordinary moment and really, I remember when I was U.S. attorney and we'd have trials where there was allegations that jurors--\n\nINGRAHAM: U.S. attorney in Iowa for people who don't know your resume.\n\nWHITAKER: In Des Moines, Iowa. So well-qualified to talk about these issues. Both, have been the Attorney General plus have been a U.S. attorney and what I - what I know is that you know that once a juror is corrupt or has a bias that the whole system falls apart and this - and really you know, I think we should be concerned about jurors and especially here unfortunately in the district of Columbia, where they kind of game the system in and have biases that they aren't willing to admit.\n\nThis person clearly had maybe not prejudged the case but certainly, had a preferred outcome and opinions on the case.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is there any way to go back in and try to - I mean, you are saying it was jury nullification on the part of Trump. Is there any way to go back in and try to overturn this you know, this case at this point? Under just because of the juror?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, so once the jury has rendered their decision, obviously there's all sorts of procedural things that attach and undoing a jury verdict is now is--\n\nINGRAHAM: No, very hard.\n\nWHITAKER: - is hard but not impossible.\n\nINGRAHAM: The DC circuit. You have to go to the DC circuit.\n\nWHITAKER: There's going to have to be a showing that it was bias and that you know, the outcome - it's harder. It's better to win a trial than to lose a trial and then try to appeal on various theories.\n\nBut - but there is - there is - the system will work and if this you know, person is demonstrated to have had these anti-Trump biases and anti-Stone biases, that can be undone.\n\nINGRAHAM: Just going back to the Bill Bar thing for a moment. I mean, you've known Bill Barr for a long time. I certainly have as well. Are you surprised by the way the media is playing this? I mean Barr - Barr is just like a - he's a no nonsense guy.\n\nHe wants to do the job and get his job done but he's been incredibly supportive of the President's agenda and incredibly phenomenal cabinet secretary over at justice but it's like they're trying to put a wedge in the relationship and President is like I have no problem with this.\n\nWHITAKER: There's no way. The president should and does have full confidence in Bill Barr. He's the perfect person to be Attorney General this time and let's - I mean, this idea that somehow the Attorney General is impotent to insert himself in the most important cases, highest profile cases facing the Department of Justice is just not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, don't they work under him?\n\nWHITAKER: Absolutely. They - all of them are.\n\nINGRAHAM: These guys who quit in other words, were they justified - we're quitting because Bill Barr, were they political actors?\n\nWHITAKER: It's been clear from his interview that they had told him, they were going to do quite the opposite and then did exactly what he had said no, let's go another direction or decision had been made and they went the other direction anyway.\n\nThis seems to be a little bit of a - of a setup to cause this exact kerfuffle.\n\nINGRAHAM: Choreographed?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, very much choreographed and you know, fundamentally, all of their powers derivative from the President and the Attorney General and if the Attorney General was led to believe and says, we should recommend - make this recommendation and they don't, you know, they shouldn't really resign, they should be concerned about being removed because that's a - that's an insubordinate act.\n\nINGRAHAM: I mean, this is article two. The President is the head of the executive branch. I mean this gets lost on a lot of people. It's like these runaway detailees from the CIA or from some other department or one prosecutor gets to run the show.\n\nWHITAKER: And just remember, career doesn't mean nonpartisan. We keep using that as inter-changeable terms and it just is not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Mr. Attorney General, great to see you.\n\nWHITAKER: Good to see you.\n\nINGRAHAM: Always great to see you. And coming up, the Democrat and media establishment seem to be warming to Mike Bloomberg but why won't they tell his full story? Up next, my Angle exposes how the former New York City Mayor has put China's interests perhaps ahead of ours.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: In Bloomberg's China cabinet. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. After I was counting chaos and slim wins for Pete and Bernie in the first two nominating contest and after Biden's campaign collapsed, you can kind of feel things changing in the Democratic Party.\n\nYou can feel it and you can hear it. I'm talking about the murmurs for Mike, the banter for Bloomy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A big winner last night could be Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bloomberg looks well-positioned now to swoop in.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wasn't given his money like Donald Trump was. He earned it the old fashioned way.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's done more to reduce violence, not only in his own city but cities across America, more than any single living person.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Bloomberg can win this campaign. Donald Trump knows it. He's afraid.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Bloomberg in a way is everything that they love. Where Trump is a proud nationalist, Bloomberg's a citizen of the world. He's a globalist from Manhattan who is phase by mass abortions but agonizes over the climate.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No matter what you think of climate change that it really has the potential to destroy our world. Which means stopping polluting and all those kinds of things.\n\nIf you want 32 ounces, take two cups to your seed, if you want 64 carry four but our hope is if you only take one, you won't go back.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, this is going to be fun. What's not to like? Well, a lot actually and it's not just that he's bad on guns, bad on immigration, terrible on healthcare and our food choices. Bloomberg's really bad when it comes to our chief economic and military threat.\n\nI'm talking about China. In fact, he can't even bring himself to use the correct words to describe their government.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: The communist party wants to stay in power in China and they listen to the public. When the public says, I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator, he has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's not a dictator?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No, he has to - he has a constituency to answer to. No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The idea that the Chinese government is responsive to sort of the democratic expression of fresh air, clean air.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Oh, come on, of course they are.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: That, in and of itself should tell us all, he should never be President. They're responsive, the Chinese government? Oh, not to the people. To the dictatorship, oh OK, that makes it OK.\n\nNow and he said this, remember China was in the midst of a brutal suppressing of the pro-democracy demonstration at Hong Kong and as we were just learning at the time, the true extent of China's vast array of concentration camps for those Uighur Muslims.\n\nBloomberg has been getting increasingly tight with the Chinese for years. He loves their massive market place and they love his money and influence in the United States.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: I first met him 15 years ago at a dinner in my house when he was the Mayor of Beijing. Today he is the most influential political figure in China and in the world. Please join me in welcoming the Vice President of China, Wang Qishan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: He's gushing over China's Vice President. Took place at the New Economy Forum that Bloomberg's company holds every year. Now, guess where they hosted this 2019 conference?\n\nWhy Beijing, of course. Of course. I'm telling you, keep your eye on Bloomberg's business activities in China. They're actually increasing as he's running for President.\n\nDemocrats might not be asking any questions about this but Newt Gingrich sure is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: What percent of his fortune came from cutting deals with the dictatorship in China? What share of the money he's going to spend to try to buy the presidency actually came from China because of his willingness to be cozy with a dictatorship?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: While China was cheating at trades, stealing our intellectual property and putting American companies out of business, Bloomberg was helping Beijing get richer and more powerful.\n\nThe Washington Post is reporting, Bloomberg while showering praise on the Communist Party leaders whose goodwill is required to play a role in the fast-growing market, led efforts since 2015 to make it easier for U.S. companies to trade in Chinese currency and expanded one of his company's financial indexes which could steer $150 billion into China while earning his firm on undisclosed amount in fees.\n\nOh, my friends we're talking billions and billions of dollars in fees made in communist China and here's a fun little fact, Bloomberg's operations rake in more money each year from China and Hong Kong than all of the businesses of the Trump organization combined that they made in all of 2018.\n\nSo with all this, whom do you think China's rooting for in November? Do they want the current president who's forced them to make concessions on trade, the one who slapped tariffs on them or would they want the guy who will basically give them everything they want?\n\nFollow the tweets from the Mayor's media company for any length of time and you'll see it's constantly pushing a pro-China agenda. They've even been called out for spiking stories critical of Beijing over at Bloomberg. Look at this headline about the coronavirus from last week.\n\nChina sacrifices a province to save the world from coronavirus. And this one. The U.S. charges a leading nanoscientist with lying about his work with the Thousand Talents program. Will China's most brilliant minds balk at coming to America? So you get the idea.\n\nNow, it will be hilarious but not completely surprising if it ends up being Bloomberg versus Trump. Now think about it. Democrats, the self-anointed champions of human rights choosing a pro-China guy as their nominate. They're also supposedly pro-American worker.\n\nSo how would it look to pick a guy who will just end up making it easier for companies here to ship jobs over there? And my goodness, how will it make the squad feel if their party runs one New York billionaire against another billionaire? The answer. Now well.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It's physically impossible. The whole thing is a joke.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You guys are crazy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is simply a disruption and a distraction.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: You get the point. They're not going to be happy and that's the Angle. All right, joining me now, Richard Goodstein, Attorney, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton along with Charlie Hurt, Opinion Editor for The Washington Times and a Fox news contributor.\n\nAll right Richard, if it means beating Trump, will Democrats defend Bloomberg's remarks and business ties to China which are vast?\n\nRICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, so the short answer is of course. That's you know, Democrats are so intent on beating Donald Trump, I think that they would be happy to have Michael Bloomberg and indeed, they're probably thrilled to see in this Quinnipiac poll that I've seen cited repeatedly over the past few days on Fox news, Michael Bloomberg beating Donald Trump by nine points today.\n\nThis is after these best few weeks of Donald Trump's political life.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, stay on track. Stay on track what I'm focused on. The Democrat party has prided itself on being the party of human rights. Divestment in South Africa. They blast Israel with a boycott, divestment deal on college campuses and yet, there is a thought they may embrace this guy who can't even call the Chinese government, a Chinese dictatorship, a communist government system and is cosying up to the dictators over there and to the way that he is.\n\nI mean how does that work Richard? How do you square that?\n\nGOODSTEIN: So I actually agree with something that Newt Gingrich said on that tape that you ran, which is let's see how much business Mike Bloomberg made from China and there's a way to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSame with Donald Trump, release your tax returns. OK? That's how we'll actually know how much is talk and how much is nonsense. And incidentally, running $1 trillion deficits is not exactly the way to get leverage over the Chinese. That's actually helps --\n\nINGRAHAM: So, again, Charlie, I'm trying to just get my head wrapped around this. Michael Bloomberg, who makes billions of dollars in China, is going to be tougher on China than Donald Trump has been? Are you kidding me? These people hated tariffs. They hated his tariffs.\n\nCHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, WASHINGTON TIMES: And that is exactly the point. Whatever investment the Trump companies have had in China, Donald Trump has been tougher on China than any president we have had in three decades.\n\nAnd I'm so grateful to you, Laura, for running that package right there, because it is so important. Not only is it a wonderful precursor to what we are going to see in ads from the Trump against a candidate like Bloomberg, but it is also very important reminder -- and you were one of the few people in the media industry who caught onto this early. One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades. And Donald Trump is the first one to call them on it. And we have seen in his first term he is willing to confront them on it. And that right there speaks --\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders is pretty good on China. It goes from Marco Rubio to Bernie Sanders. Republicans and Democrats are now waking up to the China threat. This is not some minor issue. The 21st century is either going to be ours or it's going to be China's. No doubt about it. And yet Bloomberg, he can't bring himself to say communist dictatorship. I don't know what you do.\n\nGOODSTEIN: I love the fact that Donald Trump has imposed tens of billions of dollars of taxes, tariffs we'll call them, on American consumers. We know that. That is not disputable.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And ostensibly that is opposing some hardship on China.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And meanwhile, the bailout of our auto industry was a pittance compared to what we have now had to bail out our farmers because Donald Trump has basically imposed these tariffs to make their lives miserable.\n\nHURT: Tariffs for selling goods into our country? I don't think -- that is not a tax on American people. That is actually money coming into the government coffers.\n\nGOODSTEIN: But Chinese imports -- listen, goods coming from China into the United States are being tariffed.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hold on, let's do a little economics. Why aren't we having inflation now then? Where's our inflation? If what you are saying is true, where are all the inflationary pressures on buying in the United States? They're not there. The answer is there is no inflationary tendency in this market right now.\n\nGOODSTEIN: Yes. And the fact of the matter is if the public was so thrilled with the state of the economy, Donald Trump wouldn't be down nine points down to Michael Bloomberg, Republicans would not be minus eight in the generic ballot. Donald Trump would not be under water by --\n\nINGRAHAM: Hillary was up by, what, 15 points nationally?\n\nGOODSTEIN: I agree that polls can be off.\n\nINGRAHAM: Your people were up 15 points, Hillary was up 15 points, and that went down in flames. This will too, as well. But Michael Bloomberg is a crafty person. He's very smart obviously, but this is the quintessential struggle, America versus China. Gentlemen, great conversation.\n\nSpeaking of Mike Bloomberg, fresh off his stop and frisk controversy, he held an event in Houston tonight to woo African-American voters. So what did they think? We sent Dinesh D'Souza inside to find out, and he has the video next. And then Herman Cain responds.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mike Bloomberg is making his pitch to African-Americans in Houston, Texas, tonight, and this comes after years old videos resurfacing showing Bloomberg saying un-woke things about stop and frisk and redlining. Bloomberg repudiated these past remarks, but what people at his campaign event tonight, what do they think? We sent conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza to find out, and he joins us now. Dinesh, here is a conversation you had with two ladies. Let's watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: You've heard about Bloomberg and the stop and frisk program. Is that something that bothers you about Mike, or are you OK with Mike's position on stop and frisk?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe with good intentions, but you can't implicate policies that are going to ostracize certain populations.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a mother of a young black boy. I have an eight- year-old son. And ultimately, I don't want him to be judged just by what he has on or the color of his skin. So stop and frisk, do I agree with it? Absolutely not.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: So Dinesh, those ladies were not happy about stop and frisk, but he apologized for it. He went to a church and he did a big mea culpa. And was that the common response tonight?\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: Yes, I think this was a crowd of Democratic activists. There was a kind of skeptical openness to Bloomberg, not real enthusiasm I don't think, but a willingness to hear him out. I think the issues that they are concerned about is hypocrisy, because Bloomberg saying one thing and doing another.\n\nAnd so my send, it was funny, because as I tried to interview people, I realized that half the people there worked for Bloomberg. So one after the other, I work for Bloomberg, I work for Bloomberg. I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth of the audience works for Bloomberg. I couldn't find people who were not on Bloomberg payroll to talk to. And the mood was open-minded, but a little doubtful.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, is that a Bloomberg pin you have on I'm noticing on your lapel? What is that all about? Is that how you got in there?\n\nD'SOUZA: I don't think I can keep it on much longer because I came here right from the event, but as I walked in, they slapped it on me. Everyone has to have one of these to get in. So this was the price of admission. I don't think it's good for my career for me to keep it on too long.\n\nINGRAHAM: One of the more troubling interactions tonight was about black unemployment numbers. I want to play that. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe those numbers are reflective of what is actually happening with the employment situation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: How does the president combat that disinformation? The economy has never been better for black America, and yet there are people in that audience saying I don't believe those numbers.\n\nD'SOUZA: I think it is just sheer cognitive dissonance, because these are people who have been bombarded with anti-Trump propaganda. And so then when they see Trump at the State of the Union recite this litany of great things one after the other -- a strong economy, an economy that is disproportionately benefiting the working class and African-Americans and other minorities, it's almost as if, how can that be? And so a certain kind of dissonance I think creeps in which you are forced to deny the facts in order to support the hypothesis that you have been force-fed over many, many years.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, the Quinnipiac poll that just came out, black support in the Democratic primary, Biden is at 27, he's fallen quite a bit, though, Bloomberg is at 22 percent, Sanders, 19, Buttigieg is at four. Poor little Amy is at zero, not sure what is going on there. But does that comport with what you saw tonight? This is after this tape was played, and Trump has been slamming him, but he seems pretty popular among African-Americans according to that poll.\n\nD'SOUZA: The crowd I saw was -- they were all these local -- Houston is a Democratic city. People think because it's Texas, it's got to be conservative. No. It's a Democratic city, and all the Democratic local officials were there. They had rustled up their local audiences. There were like 25 speakers before Bloomberg got to the podium. So this was one of those coming together moments. And Bloomberg has got the money. Maybe there is a feeling that the cash ultimately will deliver the goods with Bloomberg. and I think ultimately Bloomberg may just be the beneficiary of Biden's rapid political hemorrhaging, which seems to be occurring on all fronts.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, thanks so much for going out tonight.\n\nAnd as Bloomberg pitches black voters in Houston, major African-American donors are airing their grievances about the 2020 field. Politico reporting that The Democratic Party's black donor class believes the candidates aren't doing enough to court the black community. I wonder why they are so worried.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are things we can and should do right away that could deal with black money. I'm sorry, dark money.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: African-American money.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm always happy to take black money contributions.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh, that is quite a montage.\n\nJoining me now is Herman Cain, former 2012 GOP presidential candidate, and Scott Bolden, attorney, former chair of the D.C. Democrat Party. Herman, is this an opening for President Trump to woo black voters given these various missteps, some of which you just saw.\n\nHERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference. The Democrats and the liberals continue to think that there are specific things that they can say or do that's going to woo black voters. The only thing that black voters and brown voters have in common is that they are black and brown. They are not politically aligned. They are not ideologically aligned. They're no monolithic. So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.\n\nINGRAHAM: Scott, your response?\n\nSCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER D.C. DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: I don't think the polls are very credible just based on not just anecdotal, but the mythology that somehow Donald Trump, because of the economy and because of black unemployment at its lowest level is going to translate into votes for Donald Trump. Every poll, Quinnipiac or otherwise, has him in the single digits, and that is not going to change.\n\nWhat's driving black support and black donors not giving isn't because they believe they've been taken for granted. We agree with Republicans that the Democrats take black people for granted and our money for granted. What the reason the money is being held right now is because the number one priority is beating Donald Trump, and none of the Democratic candidates at this point, given how early it is, no one is convinced as to who that nominee is going to be who is going to get Donald Trump one-on-one.\n\nAnd so you're going to have a lot of money held up. I'm a black donor. I sit on the Democratic Business Council. I haven't given to a Democratic presidential candidate yet because ultimately beating Donald Trump and who is that nominee going to be, we are way early on this.\n\nINGRAHAM: You've got to make a decision.\n\nI want to play something that Elizabeth Warren had said going back to this Bloomberg issue where he does this mea culpa for standing up for stop and frisk, and makes comments about disproportionate crime. Then he walks them back, and he's just throwing money into this race, $150 million already spent, going to spend half-a-billion, I guess, on this race. This is what she said about Bloomberg. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg is saying, in effect, that the 2008 financial crash was caused because the banks weren't permitted to discriminate against black and brown people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It is getting ugly out there, Herman Cain. Warren doesn't have much of a chance at this point, but she is staying in it, and she is going to pick up Bloomberg quite a bit on this race run. Does he have enough money to overcome it?\n\nCAIN: No, he does not have enough money to overcome it. I have said this before and on your show -- many black people have left the Democrat plantation and they are not going back. They are not going to be swayed by Michael Bloomberg having a lot of money to go up against Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy. The reason that Joe Biden is falling and falling and falling in favor with the base is because they don't have an alternative to the policies that have proven to work so well. And I happen to believe that some of the black people who don't believe these low black unemployment numbers are simply victims of brainwashing by the news and the cable outlets that they watch. So no, I don't buy it. And there are some credible polls out there. Emerson is a credible poll, and Gallup is a credible poll, and they both came up with the same results.\n\nINGRAHAM: We've got to roll, guys.\n\nBOLDEN: Maybe, maybe not. But the bottom line is that black people aren't voting for Donald Trump in numbers. And when we get a Democratic nominee, black people are not going to leave Bloomberg or any of the other potential nominees simply because there is no litmus test on race or stop and frisk. There are no perfect white candidates who address all the African-American issues. They are all flawed.\n\nINGRAHAM: They address the American issues, which is everybody's issues. Health, security, the border, and economic concerns.\n\nBOLDEN: That's true, and beating Trump is the Democratic number one priority.\n\nINGRAHAM: Herman and Scott, great to see you both tonight.\n\nAnd coming up, last weekend a radical leftist plowed his van into supporters for Trump tent registering to vote. And this was in Florida over the weekend, so why isn't the media talking about this? For what reason? We have an update on that story. Plus, yet another act of political violence against Trump supporters. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now the latest on that disturbing van attack on a GOP voter registration tent in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend. As I predicted, the driver, a man named Gregory Timm, admitted he was motivated by his dislike, his hatred for President Trump.\n\nJoining me now is Dean Black, Duval County GOP chair. Dean, after it was confirmed this was politically motivated, there haven't been any media follow-ups on this story by the big three network, MSNBC and CNN as well. Why do you think that is?\n\nDEAN BLACK, DUVAL COUNTY GOP CHAIRMAN: We know exactly why that is, Laura. Dinesh D'Souza said it a few moments ago. We will call it cognitive dissonance. Clearly, they are biased. Clearly, the mainstream media isn't interested in doing the job of journalism in this country. They would rather point the finger at us when it's their own house that's on fire.\n\nAnd this violence is actually occurring all over the country. This is not just a Jacksonville thing, it's happened up in Maine, there was another incident down south of here. It happens all the time. And they refused to acknowledge it.\n\nINGRAHAM: There was actually another act of political violence in New Hampshire. I don't know if it's being tolerated, and then OK, I can do something and nothing is going to happen to me, or because the media doesn't cover it, but this is just going to keep happening.\n\nBLACK: That's right. And if they don't, like I said the other night, Laura, we are nine months away from the election. People are going to get more and more excited. And right now they have a duty to their profession and to the country to call this out, because this has no place in our electoral system. And no one, thankfully, was injured in Jacksonville.\n\nINGRAHAM: It could've been, Dean. We've got to roll.\n\nBLACK: It could've been.\n\nINGRAHAM: But unbelievable story. Media very dishonest about it.\n\nWhen we come back, the return of the Twitter smackdown.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The American Constitution is sexist by its very design. This country's laws have historically treated us like second class citizens. We still face tremendous barriers to our full participation in society.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: I had to bring back the Twitter smack down of the day after seeing that atrocity tweeted out by Pressley herself. Since facts are inconvenient to the Squad, I thought I would provide them the following facts.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The White House announced Thursday morning that President Biden will sign an executive order rescinding a rule known as the Mexico City policy which prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations from receiving U.S. funding if they promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nThe policy, first turned into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and announced at a UN conference in Mexico City, has been repealed by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republicans for decades. Biden's order will come almost four years to the day since former President Donald Trump signed an order that revived it.\n\nBIDEN TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS EXPANDING ACCESS, STRENGTHENING OBAMACARE THROUGH SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD\n\nAcross the country and around the world, people -- particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes -- have been denied access to reproductive health care, the White House said in a statement announcing that Biden will protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care through a presidential memorandum. The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally.\n\nTrump's 2017 memorandum had revived the policy under President George W. Bush, which prohibited the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from giving money to foreign NGOs that performed or promoted abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, or when needed to save a life.\n\nBIDEN SEES SHARP PARTISAN DIVIDE OVER PERFORMANCE ONE WEEK INTO PRESIDENCY: POLL\n\nTrump's memo directed the State Department to extend this to all federal departments and agencies. According to a 2020 State Department report, only eight out of 1,340 prime awardees who received funding between May 2017 and September 2018 declined to adhere to the expanded policy.\n\nA new poll from Marist and the Knights of Columbus showed that 58% of Americans oppose or strongly oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion. That included a 65% of Independents and 31% of Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe poll indicated some kind of opposition to overseas funding of abortion, asking more broadly: Do you strongly support, support, oppose, or strongly oppose using tax dollars to support abortion in other countries?\n\nA majority of Americans (77%) opposed or strongly opposed that proposition, including 64% who identified as pro-choice.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.
Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was among 70 people who had their prison sentences commuted by President Trump early Wednesday, just hours before the end of the president's term in office.\n\nThe commutation had been long sought by Kilpatrick, 50, who has served roughly seven years of a 28-year sentence for public corruption crimes on which he was convicted in 2013.\n\nAs a result of President Trump's decision, Kilpatrick will be released from prison early.\n\nSeventy-three other people, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president.\n\nWhat was his road to commutation?\n\nKilpatrick, a Detroit native and Democrat, was a Michigan state representative from 1997 to 2002 before serving as the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008.\n\nTRUMP PARDONS STEVE BANNON, LIL WAYNE, DOZENS OF OTHERS; ALSO COMMUTES SENTENCES\n\nThe former mayor's downfall began when the Detroit Free Press published text messages between him and his female chief of staff that appeared to show he lied during a police whistleblower trial while denying an affair between the pair. He resigned from office in 2008.\n\nKilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison in 2013 after he was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, extortion, and tax crimes related to shaking down contractors and rewarding his allies. The government called the scheme the Kilpatrick enterprise.\n\nHe has maintained his innocence and been fighting his sentence ever since. However, all of his appeals have failed over the years.\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals had denied his original appeal of his conviction and sentence in 2015, according to Detroit's WDIV-TV.\n\nHe filed another motion in 2017 to vacate his prison sentence, which was denied by a district court judge, the station reported.\n\nHe later asked Trump for a presidential pardon and clemency in a blog post back in 2018.\n\nBy God's grace, I have received a pardon from Him, through Christ Jesus. I pray that I will receive the opportunity for Pardon/Clemency from the President of the United States as well, he wrote on the Free Kwame Project website, according to FOX 2 of Detroit.\n\nEX-DETROIT MAYOR KWAME KILPATRICK WILL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON THIS WEEK, SISTER CLAIMS\n\nIn 2019, he was denied again by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, reports said. The U.S. Supreme Court even refused to hear his case, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nLast year, rumors spread that he was going to be freed early and allowed to live in home confinement in Georgia, the paper reported.\n\nIn November, Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett and family members said Kilpatrick would be released -- after claiming in May that he would be out due to the coronavirus. Both never happened.\n\nIn a February letter to President Trump, the Ebony Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to combating mass incarceration, argued that Kilpatrick's lengthy sentence was not appropriate for his crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKilpatrick has been incarcerated at a low-security prison in Louisiana and was originally scheduled to be released in January 2037 before Trump's commutation order was announced early Wednesday.\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.
The Mega Millions lottery is still looking for a winner to claim the second-largest grand prize in the game's history.\n\nThe pot has grown to rarified territory, with the jackpot reaching an estimated $850 million after no winner was declared during Friday's drawing.\n\nMEGA MILLIONS $750M JACKPOT: HERE'S THE TAX HIT\n\nLottery winners can either opt for a cash option -- a one-time, lump-sum payment -- or an annuity paid out over the course of about 30 years.\n\nThe cash option is estimated at about $628.2 million.\n\nNot only does this mark the second-largest prize in the game's history, but it's also the third-largest prize in American lottery history.\n\nTo date, the world-record Powerball jackpot is still $1.586 billion, which was claimed in January 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the Mega Millions record sits at $1.537 billion, which was claimed two years later in October of 2018.\n\nThe numbers that were drawn Friday night were 3, 11, 12, 38 and 43 as well as the gold Mega Ball of 15.\n\nAlthough no one hit the big jackpot, there were more than 4.6 million winning tickets at all prize levels, officials said. Eight tickets even matched the five white balls and won the game's second prize of $1 million.
Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\n\n\nMigrant caravan member cites Biden's pledge to suspend deportations for 100 days as reason for traveling to US\n\nA migrant traveling with a caravan that left Honduras on Friday told a reporter he was headed to the U.S. because soon-to-be President Joe Biden is giving us 100 days to get to the U.S.\n\nThe migrant, seen in an interview shared by The Hill, did not provide his name but said he was from Roatán, a tourist island off the northern coast of Honduras.\n\n\n\nHe appeared to be citing Biden's pledge to place a 100-day moratorium on deportations – one of several items on his agenda that will reverse some of President Donald Trump's signature policies.\n\n\n\nThe migrant told a reporter he was fleeing a bad situation that was made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, hurricanes, and a president who is not helping the people.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted, the migrant said it was to get to the U.S. because they're having a new president.\n\nHe's gonna help all of us, the migrant said of President-elect Joe Biden. He's giving us 100 days to get to the U.S. to get legal status and get a better life for our kids and family.\n\nBiden has promised a pathway to legal permanent residency for those in the country illegally and a suspension on deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

She said the president had other agendas while in the White House and hopes that one day it becomes known who exactly the president was beholden to and who pulls his strings.\n\n\n\nI would love to see his phone records to see if he was talking to Putin the day the insurgents invaded our Capitol, she said.

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has accused White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner of a political hit job by engineering his ouster from Trump's transition team following the 2016 election.\n\nChristie writes in his forthcoming book, Let Me Finish (excerpts of which were published by The Guardian on Tuesday) that while future White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was tasked with informing Christie of his dismissal days after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, Bannon made clear to me that one person and one person only was responsible for the faceless execution that Steve was now attempting to carry out. Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred a decade ago.\n\nThat's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005. The elder Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering and served 14 months in federal prison. As part of the plea deal, Charles Kushner admitted recording a sexual encounter between his brother-in-law and a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister in retaliation for what he believed was their cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nHOUSE DEMS TO PROBE IVANKA TRUMP, JARED KUSHNER AND USE OF PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS\n\nThe kid's been taking an ax to your head with the boss [Trump] ever since I got here, Christie has Bannon telling him.\n\nChristie, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate who endorsed Trump after withdrawing from the race, claims that Kushner pleaded with Trump in Christie's presence not to make him head of the transition team in April 2016.\n\nHe implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn't state one fact to back that up, writes Christie, who says Kushner's ire was based on very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.\n\nEX-TRUMP AIDE ADMITS HE MADE UP STORY ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE BEING SENT TO PICK UP MCDONALD'S\n\nChristie also describes being told by a high-ranking Trump staffer that the candidate's family was very upset about the possibility that Trump might pick Christie as his running mate, a role that ultimately went to then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Christie was also passed over for the posts of attorney general (in favor of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions) and chair of the Republican National Committee (in favor of Ronna McDaniel). Christie is particularly critical of Sessions, whom he describes as not ready for prime time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHaving been denied his choice of administration posts, Christie writes that he turned down offers to be secretary of labor, secretary of homeland security, ambassador to Italy and ambassador to Vatican City. Christie also turned down the role of special assistant to the president in the White House, which he says Trump offered him personally.\n\nLet Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics is due out Jan. 29.\n\nClick for more from The Guardian.
Teachers in Los Angeles public schools went on strike last week, holding 500,000 kids and their parents hostage as they demand more money for the lousy job their system does at providing an education.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) boasts of graduating about 80 percent of students. But only 60 percent of those who graduated actually completed the necessary coursework, reflecting an unfortunate practice of passing students who don't actually make the grade.\n\nIn 2017, only 40 percent of students in the school district met national standards for literacy. Only an abysmal 30 percent met math standards.\n\nIS THE LOS ANGELES TEACHER STRIKE REALLY ABOUT THE KIDS?\n\nWhile the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets. A study noted that were these expenses to be included, the per-pupil cost would more than double the official figure. In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools. The problem isn't money; it's government incompetence.\n\nNow the teachers' union is demanding still more money even as the number of students instructors have to teach declines. The district has lost 245,000 students over the past fifteen years. As education researcher Lisa Snell of the Reason Foundation noted, even as it was losing students, the number of total LAUSD employees grew by 5 percent over the last five years, primarily thanks to a nearly 16 percent increase in administrators. Snell also found that employee benefit costs increased 110 percent in just the last four years, and the school district's long-term debt liability jumped from $8 billion in 2007 to a whopping $25 billion in 2017.\n\nThat's more government bloat for less education.\n\nThe lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.\n\nTo the extent they are allowed, parents of LA's kids are voting with their feet, opting in ever-larger numbers to send their kids to charter schools. Some 138,000 Los Angeles students now attend charter schools, which deliver unambiguously better results. Naturally, the teachers' union hates this competition. In addition to seeking higher salaries as part of their strike demands, they also want more regulations to stifle the growth of charter schools.\n\nThis presents a conundrum for politicians in Los Angeles, a one-party town in a one-party state dominated by Democrats. Do they stand with parents and taxpayers or with government unions? If history is any guide, they'll side with the government unions.\n\nOverall, the crisis is par for the course in California. Government unions demand ever higher benefits, especially fat pensions that vastly exceed what is available to private sector workers. Politicians who depend on votes and donations from the government unions are all too eager to say yes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat is one reason why California has ended up with government debt that is at least $1.3 trillion and may actually be closer $2.3 trillion. The state's pension liability alone is $1 trillion. Plus California is still racking up new liabilities for pet projects like former Governor Jerry Brown's $100 billion high-speed train to nowhere. The new governor, Gavin Newsome, has promised to provide health care for illegal immigrants, which won't be cheap. And yet with the nation's highest top income tax rate, there are few feasible new sources of revenue.\n\nThe best solution for Los Angeles in this strike would be to emulate New Orleans, which when its public school system failed, decided to convert all its schools to charters. Better still would be vouchers that allow students to attend private schools. Surely anyone who spends five minutes at the DMV or Post Office understands that the private sector does things better than government. Education is no exception. But don't expect common sense to prevail in California.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM CHRISTIAN WHITON
There's a health care reform idea making the rounds and garnering significant attention these days. It is the very plausible sounding Medicare-for-all. Who could argue with expanding a program that America's seniors generally like and indeed have come to rely on? After all, if it's good enough for the grandparents, isn't it good enough for everyone else?\n\nWell, just as not every shiny thing has value when you're panning, this idea truly is fool's gold.\n\nCensus data shows a majority of Americans obtain their health insurance from their employers (56 percent). This is followed by Medicaid (19.3 percent), Medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase coverage (16.0 percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent).\n\nTRUMP HAS BROKEN FREE OF OBAMACARE'S GRIP, BUT MORE REFORMS CAN AND MUST BE MADE\n\nIt's important to note that the current Medicare program is not self-sufficient. Payroll taxes collected from workers and employers and all of the premiums paid by those enrolled cover only about half of Medicare's costs. Taxpayers subsidize the rest.\n\nWhen it comes to those with employer-provided health plans, a 2018 survey released by America's Health Insurance Plans shows 71 percent are satisfied with their current coverage. Why then would anyone advocate expanding a program headed for insolvency in 2026 according to the Medicare Board of Trustees, while simultaneously upending the employer provided plans that Americans like?\n\nMedicare-for-all threatens to make the same exact mistake ObamaCare made – expanding health care coverage over controlling health care costs. But think for a moment. Why do millions of Americans, even after years of ObamaCare, still lack health insurance? The answer is simple: It is too expensive.\n\nNumerous experts have estimated the cost of Medicare-for-all, including former Medicare Board of Trustees member Charles Blahous. He estimates the cost to the federal budget at $32.6 trillion. The Urban Institute estimated $32 trillion over10 years as well. Medicare-for-all would double the size of federal government spending. Even a doubling of corporate and individual income taxes would fail to cover its costs.\n\nBut cost is just one issue. Medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal. It would replace the Medicare tailored exclusively for seniors with a one-size-fits-all plan that would even wipe out the current and popular Medicare Advantage plans, with enrollees responsible for 20 percent of the cost.\n\nBesides paying more for health care, patients would undoubtedly receive inferior care. Extensive wait times seen in countries like Canada and the U.K. would now be the norm in the U.S. Current wait times in Canada are 47 weeks for neurosurgery, 38 weeks for orthopedic surgery, and 29 weeks for ophthalmology, to name just three.\n\nAnd, with current Medicare payments already 40 percent below private payments, more hospitals would close if this payment scheme were thrust on the entire system. The current physician shortage would worsen as reimbursement rates and pay were capped to control costs. Anyone who ever lived through or read about war time rationing would see a return to the ugly side of an economy of shortages.\n\nMore incremental and market-based approaches are achievable at much less expense, and with the potential to truly control costs, which is the main problem in the U.S. health care system. The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) supports expansion of health savings accounts (HSAs) with their triple tax advantages, more transparency with prescription and medical procedure pricing, and eliminating the middle men when it comes to drug pricing.\n\nAMAC has been a strong advocate of The Good Samaritan Charitable Services Act, which would allow doctors to treat up to 20 patients free of charge (pro bono) in exchange for a small tax deduction (capped at $50). Billions in annual Medicaid costs would be saved, and families would have a doctor/patient relationship rather than using expensive emergency rooms as their primary source of health care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's important to have all the facts. Some polls show support for Medicare-for-all. But when those polled are informed of the doubling of taxes required to fund such a scheme, support collapses. No wonder advocates choose not to discuss costs.\n\nJust remember, not everything that is shiny and superficially attractive has value. Or as William Shakespeare put it, All that glitters is not gold.\n\nJeff Szymanski works in political communications for The Association of Mature American Citizens.
On a day when New York's governor did an about-face and embraced mobile sports betting as a way to deal with financial losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, a company that tracks gambling legislation and performance predicted that revenue from legal sports betting could reach $3.1 billion in 2021 and as much as $10 billion within five years.\n\nVIXIO GamblingCompliance issued a report Wednesday projecting that at least six and as many as 14 additional states will legalize or expand sports betting in 2021. That fits with projections by numerous analysts that nearly half the country may have legalized sports betting by the end of this year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe company estimated that revenue from sports betting would reach $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion this year, an increase of as much as 100% over the $1.55 billion it estimates will have been generated from sports betting in 2020 (December figures have not yet been reported from most states).\n\nBy 2025, that figure could hit $10 billion, the report said.\n\nSports betting revenue represents money remaining after sportsbooks pay off winning bets and other expenses. It is separate from — and much less than — the total amount wagered on sports, which is called handle. States collect taxes on the amount of money their sportsbooks retain from sports betting, not on the total amount wagered.\n\nThe report came as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed his long-held opposition to mobile sports betting, opening the possibility of a lucrative new market in one of the nation's most populous states. It also could take a big bite out of New Jersey's leading position in the national sports betting market; about 20% of New Jersey's sports bets are placed by New Yorkers crossing the state line.\n\nAt a news conference, the Democratic governor proposed having New York run sports betting operations to maximize tax revenue.\n\nAt a time when New York faces a historic budget deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current online sports wagering structure incentivizes a large segment of New York residents to travel out of state to make online sports wagers or continue to patronize black markets, he said. New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting, we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nHe called on the New York State Gaming Commission to issue a request for proposals to select and license a sports operator or platform to offer mobile sports wagering in the state.\n\nYaniv Sherman, head of commercial development at 888 Holdings, a sports betting company, welcomed a possible full-scale entrance of New York to the national market.\n\nNew York has always been the critical, strategic and much-anticipated component of any U.S. online gambling agenda, and it represents one of the top three states in terms of economic potential, he said. It's no surprise that this is moving on the back of budget deficits in states like New York, and I think it's a great way of bringing tax dollars from offshore operations to the city and state coffers.\n\nLikewise, Adam Greenblatt, CEO of BetMGM, said his company is eager to enter New York's expanded market, saying Cuomo's move has the potential to bring leaking tax dollars back to New York from offshore books and nearby states.\n\nSara Slane, a gambling analyst and former official with the American Gaming Association, predicted New York quickly would become a top-tier state in the sports betting market.\n\nGov. Cuomo's embrace of mobile sports betting immediately positions New York to soon lead all other states and generate significant revenue for state coffers, she said. New York, with a population of nearly 20 million, dwarfs any other state with legal betting and should have no problem regularly topping $1 billion a month in wagers.\n\nNew York, like most states, expects to have a smoking crater where its budget used to be due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. That is expected to play a large part in additional states considering or enacting sports betting legislation this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe report predicted an aggressive campaign to legalize online sports betting in Texas this year, with team owners allied with DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM to press for legalization. That would require a constitutional amendment and a stateside referendum.\n\nIt forecast renewed legislative efforts to enact sports betting in Massachusetts, Georgia, Ohio and North Carolina, among others, while noting that sports betting efforts in Florida and California remain complicated by the impact they would have on tribal gambling operations and rights.
In its common definition, the job of president of the United States is to deliver peace and prosperity. Donald Trump is doing well on both fronts, so let's impeach the bastard!\n\nAs insane as it sounds, that and only that is what many Democrats have in mind. Impeachment, or death by a thousand investigations, is the heart of their plan.\n\nFor proof, eliminate their desire to remove Trump from office and see if you can pinpoint anything else with broad Dem support. Some advocate for open borders, others for tax hikes or Medicare-for-all, but ending the Trump presidency ASAP is the glue holding the party together.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt unites the leadership with the rank and file, including many of the socialist-leaning newcomers. Its migration from the far-out fringe to a daily talking point among party faithful and their national media lapdogs represents a breathtaking development.\n\nThe implications are staggering — and a potential disaster for America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN ON THE NEW YORK POST.
A majority of voters support a proposal floated by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to dramatically increase the highest tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to as high as 70 percent.\n\nAround 59 percent of registered voters support the idea, according to a Hill-HarrisX survey, which was conducted Jan. 12-13 after the New York Democrat set off a nationwide debate with her comments on CBS's 60 Minutes that she would support the increase to fund her climate change plan.\n\nThe proposed tax hike would affect those making $10 million or more, she said.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ QUESTIONS TRUMP'S WEALTH AFTER PRESIDENTIAL SWIPE\n\nThat doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said during the interview.\n\nHARRY REID SWIPES AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TAX HIKE PROPOSAL, SAYING AMERICANS WON'T ACCEPT 'RADICAL CHANGE QUICKLY'\n\nWomen supported the proposal by 62-38 percent and men favored it by 55-45 percent, according to the Hill. Southerners back the concept by a 57 to 43 percent margin and 45 percent of Republican voters also viewed it positively.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the 60 Minutes interview, Ocasio-Cortez referenced tax rates returning to levels seen in the 1950s and 1960s, when the richest Americans were taxed at up to 90 percent.
For the first time in prime time since President Trump took office, all eyes are on the Oval Office.\n\nTrump is preparing to deliver his first-ever evening address from the storied room in the White House's West Wing at 9 p.m. ET, amid a protracted partial government shutdown over funding for his proposed southern border wall, Meanwhile, Democratic leaders have been prepping an immediate response, while top Republican senators made clear they don't know exactly what to expect.\n\nWith the nation's second-longest government shutdown in history entering its 17th day and rhetoric reaching an apparent inflection point, media prognosticators and political analysts on Tuesday raised a series of pivotal but unanswered questions. Will some networks choose not to air Trump's speech in full, or attempt to fact-check his statements live?\n\nAnd will Trump, as he has suggested repeatedly in recented days, announce that he will use his emergency powers to build the wall even without congressional funding?\n\nHow will Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handle their unusual, nationally televised tandem response to Trump's remarks?\n\nThe White House requested eight minutes to make Trump's case on television. It invited representatives from cable news outlets to a White House lunch with Trump ahead of the address, a gesture that is typically reserved for the lead-up to State of the Union speeches.\n\nRegardless of what transpires, negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration says an illegal immigration crisis is worsening by the day.\n\nThe number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.\n\nBORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN: MASSIVE INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS CROSSED BORDER ILLEGALLY IN 2018\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News that he doesn't know what Trump will say during his prime-time address. But Graham added that Trump ideally will not use his presidential emergency powers to order the military to construct a border wall, saying that passing a spending bill in Congress is the better way to tackle the issue.\n\nSouth Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, said he doesn't think the emergency declaration is the right move and that I prefer that we get this resolved the old-fashioned way.\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-.Ky., who met with Vice President Mike Pencc on Capitol Hill earlier in the day, did not answer when asked by Fox News on Tuesday whether he thought declaring a national emergency would be a good idea. But in a statement and remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell emphasized his support for the White House's aggressive tack.\n\nCAN TRUMP USE EMERGENCY POWERS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL?\n\nIn light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.\n\nHouse GOP leaders, after speaking with Pence, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, seemed similarly aligned.\n\nGOP Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, reiterated to Fox News that he thinks a congressional compromise -- rather than emergency military spending -- is the best way to build the wall.\n\nAnd House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the president may take whatever action he needs to fund the wall.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway seemed optimistic, giving a thumbs-up sign to reporters after the meeting.\n\nAfter a sit-down with Democrats over the weekend, the White House issued a series of budget demands, including a new request for $800,000 for humanitarian needs. But mostly Trump still wants his wall, which Democrats describe as immoral as well as no solution to illegal immigration.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, the White House said Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown. That shutdown exemption would break from past practice and could be challenged.\n\nEmphasizing that he's not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\n\nPelosi, for her part, has also sparred openly with the White House. She reportedly engaged in a tense confrontation with Nielsen on Wednesday in the Situation Room, with the California Democrat interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her I reject your facts.\n\nLeaning on Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing anxious about the impact of the shutdown, Pelosi said the House would begin passing individual bills this week to reopen shuttered federal agencies, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Tuesday night promised to be a historic night and a kind of political prime-time prizefight, television viewers who were hoping to have a less political evening still have options.\n\nIf you're looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9pm EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for 8 minutes on Instagram live, porn star Stormy Daniels, whose protracted legal battle with the president has dominated national headlines, wrote Tuesday afternooon on Twitter.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Alex Pappas, Jason Donner, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
In these last hours before the Jan. 5 runoff for the U.S. Senate seats in Georgia, I have only one message.\n\nVote as if America depends on it – because it does.\n\nJan. 5 is the most consequential runoff election in American history.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: MY PREDICTIONS FOR NEXT 10 YEARS — I EXPECT THESE BIG CHANGES\n\nIf Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win, the Republican majority in the Senate will be empowered to moderate the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration. It will be able to stop virtually every radical appointment to government and proposal for legislation.\n\nIf the two radicals, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win, then Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will be able, with the help of Vice President Harris (who will serve as president of the Senate), to push through radical appointments and legislation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurthermore, the difference in service to Georgia communities between Perdue-Loeffler and Warnock-Ossoff is enormous.\n\nWarnock has already proven he will be attentive to radicals and those in the Black community who agree with him (but not those who disagree with him). However, since Warnock describes people who want to cut taxes as baby killers in the tradition of King Herod, it is difficult to see how he can serve the majority of Georgians, who prefer lower taxes to higher taxes.\n\nSimilarly, Warnock is openly, proudly and noisily for abortion on-demand – even in the ninth month – and for tax-paid abortions. It is hard to see how he is going to reach out and work with the millions of Georgians who are pro-life.\n\nOssoff will clearly be focused more on the San Francisco values of Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., than on the issues that matter to Georgia. Ossoff raises far more money in California than in Georgia. It was no accident that he and Warnock had their first joint fundraiser in a restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nIn fact, both Ossoff and Warnock raise the overwhelming bulk of their money from non-Georgians, and they are clearly the candidates of liberals and radicals across the country.\n\nSymbolically, it was revealing when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at his press conference just before Christmas that he could not finalize his city budget (which is more than $3 billion in deficit for this year alone) until the Georgia Senate races were decided. The mayor is hoping an Ossoff-Warnock victory will open the way for New York City to reach into Georgians' wallets to bail out his bankrupt administration.\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5. To boycott the election is to surrender America's future.\n\nBy contrast, we know from six years of Perdue's hard work that he has helped Georgians across the state. In town after town, there are people, companies and causes that Perdue has helped. He fought to cut taxes for every Georgia family. He voted to strengthen and train – not defund – our police officers. He worked to roll back unnecessary and expensive regulations on Georgia's farmers. And he supported the CARES Act to help Georgia fight the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nSimilarly, it is clear from her first year in office that Loeffler has a clear focus on Georgia. She has been crisscrossing the state helping solve problems and cutting red tape in the federal government to get aid to Georgia communities and businesses. In the Senate, she fought for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helped return agriculture and manufacturing jobs to Georgia. She has fought against radical pro-abortion proposals. And her work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has helped ensure Georgia's veterans get the health care they deserve – and the training and education they need to succeed after their military service.\n\nBoth Sens. Perdue and Loeffler have clear records of voting conservative and standing firm for the values of more freedom, more jobs, lower taxes and less bureaucracy. Their records are a clear contrast with the Warnock-Ossuf record of radicalism.\n\nThe choice is clear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5. To boycott the election is to surrender America's future.\n\nThe fate of America will be affected by the outcome of this runoff.\n\nYou can – and you must – make a difference.\n\nTo read, hear and watch more of Newt's commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH
Embattled New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took aim at the city's wealthiest residents on Thursday, calling for taxes that will redistribute the wealth and fund recovery efforts following the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDe Blasio outlined his revitalization plans during his final State of the City address. The mayor argued that higher taxes on the rich would generate revenue to aid an overhaul of a local economy reeling from the pandemic.\n\nWe're going to work constantly for a fairer economy, and that means we must tax the wealthy and we must redistribute the wealth of this city to those who do the work, de Blasio said in the address. Even during the height of the pandemic, we saw the stock market boom. We saw 120 New York billionaires grow their net worth by $77 billion.\n\nDe Blasio called for wealth distribution even as he faces criticism from local business leaders over his handling of the pandemic. Advocates for New York City's restaurant industry and local small businesses have argued that Democratic leaders imposed strict lockdowns and failed to provide adequate support, contributing to hundreds of closures.\n\nProgressive New York lawmakers, including de Blasio and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have repeatedly called for increased taxes on the rich as a means to aid struggling Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned the state could raise taxes to address a historic budget crunch without additional federal aid. An estimated 70,000 net residents left New York City from the start of the pandemic in March until last December, costing an estimated $34 billion in lost income, according to a study from analytics firm Unacast.\n\nDe Blasio said his administration would join the fight for higher taxes for the wealthy and a new billionaire's tax, adding that initiatives would give us the resources that can build a recovery for all of us.\n\nAside from his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, de Blasio detailed the launch of a recovery tax credit for small businesses as well as a loan program for entrepreneurs attempting to recover from the pandemic.\n\nHe touted the success of his Open Restaurants program for outdoor dining, which he said allowed the city to bring those restaurants back and save 100,000 jobs. Indoor dining is currently banned in New York City, though it is expected to restart soon.\n\nThe mayor spoke at length about his plans to combat climate change, arguing that New York City has to lead the way in ending the use of fossil fuels. De Blasio pledged to commit $50 billion in city pension resources toward renewable energy investments over the next 15 years while pulling any remaining funding for fossil fuel companies.\n\nNew York City will add two-way bike lanes to the Brooklyn and Queensboro Bridges, add bike boulevards throughout the five boroughs and open more streets to pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese are the kinds of changes that allow us to move out of the era of fossil fuels and the era of the automobile and into a green future as part of our commitment to the New York City Green New Deal, de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio said New York has set a goal of vaccinating five million city residents by June and of fully reopening schools by September. Additionally, City Hall plans to use federal stimulus funds to create a City Cleanup Corps, which de Blasio likened to a program from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program during the Great Depression.\n\nDe Blasio will exit the mayor's office at the end of 2021 due to term limits.
PHILADELPHIA -- Kevin Walter and his wife, Melissa, opened their dream brewhouse in the Callowhill section of Philadelphia less than a year ago. But for the past month they, like other craft brewery owners, have been on edge as the federal government shutdown has turned off the tap for many breweries across the nation.\n\nWithout having our labels approved we can't produce new beer, which means we can't sell new beer, Walter said. And selling new beer is sort of a craft brewers niche, it's what our customers want.\n\nThe shutdown affecting more than 800,000 federal workers has frozen activity for the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the government entity that regulates alcoholic beverages.\n\nSENATE PANEL RELEASES TEXT OF BILL TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDED WALL MONEY\n\nSo for more than 30 days, Love City Brewing and roughly 7,000 local and independently owned breweries nationwide have been squeezed – new releases have been placed on hold, interstate shipments have been halted and grand openings pushed back.\n\nNew, now, next is what keeps us going, Walter said.\n\nBob Pease, president of the Colorado-based Brewers Association, a not-for-profit trade association, said the industry cannot afford the squeeze.\n\nThe margin of error is so small for these entrepreneurs that the prospect for economic hardship is likely and may be significant during this shutdown, Pease said.\n\nBrewers are increasingly nervous that they will lose money if brewery openings and seasonal beers are delayed much longer in the dispute over President Donald Trump's demand for a taxpayer-funded wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe shutdown that began Dec. 22 pinches primarily craft brewers, which offer wider varieties of beer and selections that change constantly. The biggest brewers are largely unaffected because they already have government approval for their top national brands.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS BEER DISTRIBUTOR LOSES UPWARDS OF $2K/ DAY OVER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nUncertainty is going to cause small and independent breweries to not hire people, cancel seasonal releases, or – even more frightening – lay off workers, said Pease.\n\nAccording to a report by the Brewers Association, small and independent craft brewers account for more than 135,000 jobs in 2017, which is an increase of 6,000 from the previous year. Small and independently owned craft breweries account for 98 percent of all U.S. operating breweries.\n\nPlacing owners like Walter in a bind.\n\nWithout label approval from the treasury department, Love City Brewing can't release new canned beers—a function he said is essential to the business' growth.\n\nIf we can't have a portion of our seasonal product in cans, then it's going to be very difficult for us to compete, Walter said.\n\nThe pain is also being felt across town at Dock Street Brewery in West Philadelphia. A veteran brewhouse known for its outlandish beer formulas, like goat brain-brewed beer that is an ode to the Walking Dead series, has already missed two new launches and may have to reschedule or scrap its entire winter product lineup.\n\nIt's just a shame because it's January and people would maybe like some entertainment to get through the winter, said Marilyn Candeloro, manager of Dock Street Brewery.\n\nCandelora said the formulas have to be approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau before the brewhouse can move forward with new labels.\n\nIt's the artist and the printer who would have made the label, the distributor who would have sold the beer and the consumer who would like to drink it, said Candeloro.\n\nBrewers said that even after the shutdown ends, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau could be saddled with a months-long backlog in approval requests.\n\nSmall business is the backbone of America's economy, and brewers are a part of that backbone, Pease said. So for owners not to be able to innovate and live out their dream due to due to difficulties at the federal level – that is just incredibly frustrating.
Mike The Situation Sorrentino has apparently received quite the bit of fan mail after reporting to prison earlier this week.\n\nThe Jersey Shore alum's wife, Lauren Pesce, reached out to her husband's Twitter followers Thursday, thanking them for their show of support.\n\nAnd part of that support has come through the mail as Sorrentino has received thousands of letters, she tweeted.\n\n'JERSEY SHORE' STAR MIKE 'THE SITUATION' SORRENTINO CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS WITH WIFE BEFORE PRISON\n\nMike would like to thank all of his fans worldwide for the unbelievable outpouring of love & support. We speak everyday & he's doing great, Pesce wrote. He's received thousands of letters, he won't be able to respond to everyone but wanted to express his gratitude to each and everyone of you.

If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,\n\ntheir party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If\n\neither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, Mitch\n\nMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Biden\n\nadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already cast\n\ntheir votes in these crucial races.\n\n\n\nMeantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\n\nGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,\n\nwe'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator Kelly\n\nLoeffler.\n\n\n\nBut first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on the\n\ncampaign trail -- Peter.\n\n\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, early voting data shows\n\nRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's where\n\nPresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run up\n\nthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, a\n\nvisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next\n\nchapter in American history.\n\n\n\nDOOCY (voice-over): Republican candidates agree, but for different\n\nreasons.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we're\n\ngoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Raphael\n\nWarnock.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered for\n\ninvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\nWARNOCK: Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should be\n\nsitting in that seat.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantining\n\nafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusing\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.\n\n\n\nPERDUE: This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involved\n\nwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: We have two United States senators who, when they learned about\n\nthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first call\n\nwas to their broker.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDOOCY (on camera): Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people that\n\nthey come across.

Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.\n\n\n\nJoining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nSEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, on\n\nas well. He declined.\n\n\n\nThank you for being here.\n\n\n\nIt's a little cold for Atlanta.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's okay, it's going to warm up.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, that's right.\n\n\n\nSenator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- we\n\nare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 million\n\nGeorgians have already voted.\n\n\n\nWhere did you and your team see this race right now?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get\n\nout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is on\n\nthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast between\n\nthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, government\n\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nWe know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going\n\nto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is\n\nnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run\n\nhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of\n\nchange.\n\n\n\nRadical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that would\n\nfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We are going to talk about that in a minute.\n\n\n\nAre you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing\n\nchallenge to the election?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to know\n\nthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure that\n\nthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.\n\n\n\nBut from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over the\n\nlast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that in\n\nearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffs\n\nand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see a\n\nrecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will win\n\nif our voters turnout.\n\n\n\nBAIER: This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten other\n\nRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh\n\nHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn't\n\nan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not on\n\nthat list.\n\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,\n\nand I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia and\n\nall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objective\n\nright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottom\n\nof what happened in these elections.\n\n\n\nWe know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's what\n\nwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.\n\nHe's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, he\n\ntweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here in\n\nGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and\n\ninvalid.\n\n\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came down\n\nto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for David\n\nPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.\n\n\n\nHe's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going to\n\ntell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, because\n\nthis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.\n\n\n\nWe won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose the\n\nfuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish the\n\nfilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raise\n\nour taxes, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\nGeorgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but\n\nJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you say\n\nwhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybe\n\nspecifically from Georgia?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one of\n\nthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for this\n\npresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are going\n\nto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking very\n\nclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called\n\nthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.\n\nSenators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasing\n\na statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.\n\n\n\nThey failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in\n\ncourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. I\n\nacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had\n\nirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this\n\nelection.\n\n\n\nIs he right?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a way\n\nthat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's what\n\nI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.\n\n\n\nBut the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on\n\nTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that next\n\nstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,\n\nand then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for how\n\nthese elections were handled.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturn\n\nany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 open\n\ninvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen too\n\nmuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases that\n\nhave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, where\n\nthey haven't found that evidence.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.\n\nWe need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the\n\nintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protect\n\nthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,\n\nand that's what I'm looking at right now.\n\n\n\nThis is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the\n\n5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the\n\ncampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you know\n\nyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack on\n\nyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: When she heard about the\n\ncoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her own\n\nwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 million\n\nworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he says\n\nover and over again on the trail?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, this is a political attack that has been completely\n\ndebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.\n\nThe mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed\n\nbecause it's completely debunked.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So it didn't happen?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,\n\nthis is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer for\n\ntheir radical policies to change America.\n\n\n\nThe radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are that\n\nhe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. He\n\nwas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. He\n\nwon't answer those questions.\n\n\n\nThat's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'm\n\nhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounce\n\nMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attacked\n\nour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.\n\n\n\nHe said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised Fidel\n\nCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out\n\nof step with Georgia's values.\n\n\n\nBAIER: A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump may\n\nhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to not\n\nsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Then\n\nby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which he\n\nthen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which you\n\noriginally supported and voted for.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.\n\nHe's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in the\n\nmilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and our\n\nnational security.\n\n\n\nBut, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure that\n\nGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter\n\nif we don't win on the 5th.\n\n\n\nLook, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.\n\nRaphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the\n\nmilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run health\n\ncare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.\n\n\n\nThat's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'm\n\nfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying how\n\nimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a big\n\ndefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.\n\n\n\nHow would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out\n\nof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don't\n\nknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue to\n\nstand with our men and women in the military.\n\n\n\nRaphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. He\n\nsaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's veto\n\non the NDAA?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.\n\nThose are what's on the ballot right now.\n\n\n\nI'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest\n\nstate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have fought\n\nfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we are\n\ngoing to continue to do that.\n\n\n\nBut if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded and\n\nworse.\n\n\n\nBAIER: I won't belabor it but that's not a yes or no whether you would\n\nsustain the veto or not.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's right.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK, you're not answering that.\n\n\n\nListen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said voters\n\nin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimited\n\npower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote to\n\nkill the filibuster.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to take\n\nGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.\n\nHe's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, it\n\nwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he would\n\nabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally change\n\nthis country, pack the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMy opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions\n\nabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court with\n\nliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule of\n\nlaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everything\n\nthat's under attack right now by the left.\n\n\n\nSo we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we\n\nwon't get a second chance.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.\n\nThis is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of the\n\nU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militias\n\ninside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forces\n\nare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.\n\n\n\nWhat should the response be if that happens?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he's\n\nmade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for the\n\nfirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerous\n\nJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.\n\n\n\nSo we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's our\n\nfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to this\n\npresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSenator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you\n\nvery much for your time.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Thank you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nUp next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake in\n\nthese runoffs.\n\n\n\nPlus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on to\n\ncontest the election results -- as FOX News Sunday continues from the\n\nGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,\n\nmany of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not been\n\nheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak up\n\nfor my constituents in this process.\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): This is just grossly responsible by Senator\n\nHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in our\n\ndemocratic process.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object to\n\ncertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday and\n\nthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.\n\n\n\nIt's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason\n\nChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for The Wall Street\n\nJournal, and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.\n\n\n\nJason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOP\n\nsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point and\n\nelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority to\n\nconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputed\n\nstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission\n\n'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a\n\nchange in their vote if needed.\n\n\n\nYour thoughts on this move?\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, if they're going to ask\n\nCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's no\n\nreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.\n\nThat's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and\n\nI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House who\n\nare concerned about it.\n\n\n\nNow, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I\n\ndon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because\n\nthere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated and\n\nlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the House\n\nare doing.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer\n\nwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see\n\nenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure\n\nis still on Trump allies.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, let's just take the\n\nvarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and as\n\nsuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, the\n\nRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the people\n\nchoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people's\n\nright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nThis is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it's\n\nshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.\n\nWhy not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you\n\npointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than\n\n90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this and\n\nfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of these\n\nelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities might\n\nhave existed.\n\n\n\nNothing that would change the results of the election, but it does\n\nundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to the\n\ncredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If the\n\nDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, Bret. I think you're\n\nabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and House\n\nmembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.\n\nWhat we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these members\n\nare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from their\n\nconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,\n\ntaking a stand and defending the president and we know the president has\n\nbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wanting\n\npeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\nAnd so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sort\n\nof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you're\n\nseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they are\n\nup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024\n\nand how this might play for them then.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the votes\n\neventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6th\n\neventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it's\n\nwritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go\n\nthere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there are\n\nmillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair\n\nand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they express\n\nthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?\n\n\n\nI don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,\n\nyou know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for us\n\nas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't think\n\nit will pass.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others are\n\nsaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this is\n\nin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this and\n\nthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any one\n\njudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congress\n\nand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States of\n\nAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.\n\nThey actually posed this question to Congress.\n\n\n\nAnd so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want to\n\nobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's not\n\njust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we do\n\nthink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicans\n\ngoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and to\n\ncome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for the\n\nparty?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at this\n\njuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as you\n\nmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.\n\n\n\nWell, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sort\n\nof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\nBut he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to say\n\nas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal to\n\nPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out any\n\nagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulus\n\nspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president's\n\nveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellow\n\nRepublicans.\n\n\n\nSo, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at\n\nthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's about\n\nRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't think\n\nthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing to\n\nchallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you're\n\ntalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracy\n\ntheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about American\n\npolitics when it doesn't go our way.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president can\n\ntake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.\n\n\n\nPanel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.\n\n\n\nComing up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus about\n\nwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strange\n\nbedfellows.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Trump is right in saying that's not enough. We\n\nneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on this\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the relief\n\nchecks stand next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in and\n\nlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who has\n\nserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but her\n\npath to victory is a narrow one.\n\n\n\nJoining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, Hakeem\n\nJeffries.\n\n\n\nCongressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\n\n\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think divided\n\ngovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator\n\n-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all the\n\nHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of the\n\nlegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Biden\n\nis the next president of the United States of America, believing that he\n\nhas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy to\n\naddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, as\n\nthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, is\n\ngoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for him\n\nand those who didn't.\n\n\n\nAnd here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well\n\nas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf of\n\nthe American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for\n\nthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosi\n\nwill lose?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United States\n\nHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name into\n\nnomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she's\n\ndone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leader\n\nthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials and\n\ntribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, has\n\nhelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing in\n\nthat capacity.\n\n\n\nBAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but how\n\ndoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,\n\nand steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow path\n\nbecause of the votes that you have?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believe\n\nin the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the\n\naspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with the\n\nUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tent\n\napproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people is\n\nincredibly important.\n\n\n\nWe've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over the\n\nlast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues\n\nlike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First Step\n\nAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the United\n\nStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreement\n\nthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with President\n\nTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the American\n\npeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as he\n\npushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.\n\n\n\nAnd so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in a\n\npractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. That\n\napplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. That\n\napplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's a\n\nRepublican or a Democrat.\n\n\n\nBAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --\n\nthe House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules package\n\nfor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena and\n\ninvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to\n\n-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, he or she\n\nwould become member or delegate or resident commissioner. Father\n\nand mother would become parent, while brother and sister would\n\nbecome sibling.\n\n\n\nAre these the things that are the priority going after the Trump\n\nadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk about\n\ngender-neutral terms?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crush\n\nthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans who\n\nare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good of\n\neveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first\n\n100 days. That will continue to be our focus.\n\n\n\nThis is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century\n\ncontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And so\n\nthat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focus\n\nover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadly\n\npandemic behind us.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of government\n\nat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's a\n\nDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And we\n\nhave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on any\n\nexecutive branch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward with\n\nrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\n\nWhen we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our\n\nconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we took\n\nthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to be\n\nfocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health care\n\nchallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring good\n\npaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be our\n\nguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden and\n\nKamala Harris to build back better for the people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutral\n\nlanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from the\n\nelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking they\n\nwere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that say\n\nthey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that this\n\nis an example of that. How would you respond to that?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusive\n\nas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the House\n\nat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,\n\nthat would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason why\n\nwe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, six\n\nyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think that\n\nthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the most\n\ninclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possible\n\nway of the American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the direct\n\npayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,\n\nbeginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then the\n\nnegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this new\n\neffort to get more direct payments.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate America\n\nreceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put\n\nthe schmooze on is so pathetic.\n\n\n\nI would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they\n\nwill be going out soon.\n\n\n\nWho is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnell\n\nand the Senate Republicans.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 direct\n\npayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was being\n\nheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin and\n\nSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.\n\n\n\nSo people looking at that scratch their heads.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is that\n\nMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust to\n\nthe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in the\n\nHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those direct\n\npayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting in\n\na tremendous way.\n\n\n\nNow, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democratic\n\nside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth of\n\ndebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1\n\npercent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was not\n\ngood public policy in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nI think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we're\n\nproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be part\n\nof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and the\n\nafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That's\n\nwhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join the\n\nAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many House\n\nRepublicans in getting this done.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on this\n\nholiday weekend. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with the\n\nBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to the\n\ncritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats and\n\nRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what can\n\nhappen in government.\n\n\n\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men and\n\nwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'll\n\nappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack\n\nReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of the\n\ndefense spending bill.\n\n\n\nAnd we're back with our panel.\n\n\n\nCatherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heard\n\nSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about\n\nthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.\n\n\n\nAs you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more about\n\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it was interesting, Bret,\n\nhow senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,\n\nobviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need President\n\nTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicans\n\nknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a huge\n\nturnout for Election Day.\n\n\n\nI think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it was\n\na notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we've\n\nseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot of\n\nsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest the\n\nelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to do\n\nthat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buck\n\nhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisan\n\npiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concerned\n\nabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of the\n\nSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently after\n\nJanuary 20th.\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,\n\nthe margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or two\n\nsenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. And\n\neven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her life\n\nto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,\n\nbut she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But every\n\nsingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that and\n\nreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.\n\n\n\nI think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislation\n\nif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservative\n\nmove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, that\n\nthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates to\n\nget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? I\n\nmean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of the\n\nmoderates?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderates\n\nactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the party\n\nhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the\n\nsquad, and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over the\n\nbarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, under\n\nNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday and\n\nhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the two\n\nand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two and\n\nits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that Mitch\n\nMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block much\n\nof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,\n\nthese radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold of\n\nthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may have\n\nto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderates\n\nbecause his margins are smaller.\n\n\n\nOn the House side, I think that's also the case.\n\n\n\nNow, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or not\n\nshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or\n\nnot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. But\n\nshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, even\n\nwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be a\n\nvery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmer\n\nRepublican majority in the Senate.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's going\n\nto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four members\n\nshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.\n\n\n\nLUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we move\n\nforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on the\n\nidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he has\n\nrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go back\n\na very long way.\n\n\n\nBut he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,\n\nyou know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- you\n\nknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities and\n\nparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remains\n\nto be seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes,\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I think\n\nRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but get\n\nout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicans\n\nhave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --\n\nthe wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousand\n\nlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Do\n\nthey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show up\n\nbecause they're angry?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.\n\nI think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You've\n\neven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. But\n\nthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the big\n\nconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.\n\nEvery vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or the\n\nother.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all. We'll see you next\n\nSunday.\n\n\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. Alan Alda played a wise guy on the\n\nTV series M*A*S*H. Now he's sharing some wisdom in a fascinating second\n\nact.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, he brought laughter to generations as Hawkeye Pierce on the TV\n\nclassic M*A*S*H. Now he's bringing his lifelong passions for science and\n\ncommunication to his hit podcast.\n\n\n\nHere's Chris Wallace with his Power Player of the Week.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nALAN ALDA, ACTOR AND PODCASTER: What we really need now, more effective\n\ncommunication, not only about COVID, but we need to communicate with each\n\nother better about the things we value.\n\n\n\nI have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just a TV doctor.\n\n\n\nI like to think of you as (ph) people.\n\n\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (voice over): Alan Alda has been\n\ncommunicating brilliantly for 84 years now.\n\n\n\nALDA: Please, please, you're too kind.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: As Hawkeye Pierce on the legendary TV show M*A*S*H, he gave\n\nvoice to a generation questioning authority.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not through here.\n\n\n\nALDA: Then we'll disregard the rumor.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Now he's teaching scientists how to share their discoveries with\n\nthe rest of us.\n\n\n\nALDA: I think to a great extent our lives depend on whether or not we\n\nunderstand the science that's being delivered to us and whether we trust\n\nthe people who are talking with us.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: A decade ago he founded the Alda Center for Communicating Science\n\nat Stony Brook University and he found his improv skills as an actor\n\ntranslate to this very different stage.\n\n\n\nALDA: You're not just reciting a lecture at somebody, you're actually\n\ntalking to them. You're -- you're -- you're speaking to them the way you\n\nwould to a -- to a friend.\n\n\n\nI hope you get a chance to listen to my new podcast.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: This passion for communicating also led Alda to start a hit\n\npodcast, now in its ninth season.\n\n\n\nALDA: I have conversations with people who are, many of them, icons in the\n\nculture, but it's all conversation.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): What is the secret to communicating?\n\n\n\nALDA: You know, ironically, I think the secret to good communication is\n\nlistening.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Alda has embraced tech and social media and talks\n\nopenly about how he's now dealing with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): I understand that your staff has a nickname for you.\n\n\n\nALDA: They call me the world's oldest millennial.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Of course for most of us, Alan Alda will always be\n\npart of that unruly gang on M*A*S*H. One hundred and six million people\n\nwatched the 1983 finale, still a record for a scripted show.\n\n\n\nALDA: I look back with amazement, people who we way not born yet when we\n\nwent off the air, are writing to me and telling me that -- how much it\n\nmeans to them.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Almost 50 years later, the bonds among the cast remains strong.\n\n\n\nALDA: There's a kind of funny video that I posted of me showing Mike\n\nFarrell, who I acted with on M*A*S*H, how to download the podcast.\n\n\n\nALDA: There it is. There it is.\n\n\n\nMIKE FARRELL, ACTOR: Alan Alda.\n\n\n\nALDA: And he slowly gets it.\n\n\n\nALDA: Now I'm subscribing to Clear and Vivid.\n\n\n\nFARRELL: I'm subscribed.\n\n\n\nALDA: I'm so excited.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Last year, Alda posted an old video that went viral, of him tap\n\ndancing with his granddaughter.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): How do you feel about your life these days and what's\n\nyour attitude going forward?\n\n\n\nALDA: I plan to keep figuring out what's -- what's worth doing and having\n\nfun and laughing right up until the last.

It's past time for the media to begin asking President Obama tough questions about the IRS conservative targeting scandal. After all he was involved, publicly, from the beginning.\n\nLast Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.\n\nAnd it is an ugly story indeed.\n\nWhat was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) no longer operative.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nInstead, we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party, beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009, that is empowered, encouraged, and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington, but also through outright targeting by the White House, Congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media.\n\nIn fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a threat to democracy.\n\nConsider President Obama's aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups' applications for tax exemption.\n\nOn August 9, 2010 the president warned of attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don't know who's behind these ads and we don't know who's paying for them . . . you don't know if it's a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don't want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, President Obama once again warned that some unidentified foreign-controlled entity could be providing millions of dollars for attack ads. Less than one week later, he complained that nobody knows the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups and he claimed such groups were guided by seasoned Republican political operatives and potentially supported by some unidentified foreign controlled entity.\n\nOn October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with benign sounding names a problem for democracy; the next week he complained about individuals who hide behind those front groups, called such groups a threat to our democracy, and claimed such groups were engaged in unsupervised spending.\n\nNext, consider the IRS's actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting, it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.\n\nWho are your donors?\n\nWhat is the political activity of your family and associates?\n\nWhat are the passwords for your websites?\n\nAfter all, according to the president, you're only afraid to answer these questions if you've got something to hide.\n\nThe demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy foreign involvement in the Tea Party groups, a charge incredible on its face, but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups, a threat to our democracy.\n\nWhen the president of the United States declares these groups a threat to our democracy is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting, intimidation, and governmental intrusion?\n\nOne grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a threat to democracy potentially run by political operatives or foreign-controlled, and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.\n\nWas the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.\n\nA president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?\n\nNow that is a threat to democracy.

president trump is deranged, unhinged, dangerous, and deserving of prosecution, house speaker nancy pelosi says in an interview scheduled to air sunday night on 60 minutes.\n\nthe san francisco democrat sat down for a conversation with lesley stahl of the cbs news program last week following wednesday's siege of the u.s. capitol by a crowd of protesters.\n\nis anybody running the executive branch of the government? who is running the executive branch? stahl asks in a preview clip released by cbs, implying that trump may have abdicated his position in the waning days of his term following criticism over the capitol security breach.\n\nwell, sadly, the person who's running the executive branch is a deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the united states, pelosi asserts in response.\n\nand we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him. but he has done something so serious that there should be prosecution against him.\n\npelosi: capitol rioters chose their 'whiteness' over democracy\n\npelosi, 80, of course, is a frequent target of ire from president trump and other republicans, along with sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., the democrats' leader in the other chamber of congress. the gop typically regards democratic policy proposals as unnecessary, expensive, overly restrictive – or some combination thereof.\n\n'fire pelosi'\n\nat a trump rally near the white house that preceded the capitol siege, rep. mo brooks, an alabama republican and vocal trump supporter, wore a red cap saying fire pelosi, when he addressed the crowd on wednesday.\n\nin separate remarks saturday, in an online meeting with her san francisco constituents, pelosi characterized the capitol siege in racial terms, accusing the participants of having chosen their whiteness over a regard for american democracy.\n\nit has been an epiphany for the world to see that there are people in our country led by this president, for the moment, who have chosen their whiteness over democracy, pelosi said, according to the associated press.\n\n'nothing is off the table'\n\nlater in the 60 minutes clip, stahl then inquires whether lawmakers have declared the 25th amendment of the constitution – which outlines steps for removal of a sitting president – off the table in their conversations about how to react to trump after the capitol riot.\n\nno, it isn't. nothing is off the table, pelosi answered.\n\nwhat is the 25th amendment and how does it work?\n\nin another cbs preview clip, pelosi describes her experience inside the capitol as protesters were gathering outside and then entering the building.\n\ni was pulled from the podium, just literally pulled from the podium, pelosi says, presumably referring to capitol security personnel.\n\nthe volatile situation saw lawmakers – pelosi among them – seeking cover inside the building as protesters ran roughshod through hallways and even into lawmakers' offices.\n\nthey were vocally saying, 'where's the speaker? we know she has staff. they're here someplace. we're going to find them, pelosi tells stahl, though it was unclear whether the speaker was referring to security personnel or to members of the crowd.\n\nnews coverage of the siege included at least two widely distributed photos linked to pelosi: in one shot, a man is seen carrying a podium that authorities said was from pelosi's office, and in another shot a different man is seen seated inside pelosi's office, with his left foot up on one of the desks.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nboth men have reportedly been arrested in connection with the siege:\n\nthe man seen carrying the podium has been identified by authorities as adam christian johnson, 36, who was apprehended in pinellas county, fla. the justice department said johnson has been charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; one count of theft of government property; and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on capitol grounds.\n\nthe man seen seated in pelosi's office has been identified by authorities as richard barnett, 60, of gravette, ark. he has been charged with violent entry and theft of public property, among other offenses, and was expected to be extradited to washington after his arrest in arkansas, authorities told fox news.\n\nfox news' audrey conklin and louis casiano and the associated press contributed to this story.
like millions of victims of rampant gun crime in brazil, claudio sotero júnior is clear about what he wants: his own gun.\n\nhis store near são paulo selling bodybuilding supplements has been robbed at gunpoint six times since he opened it in 2006. three years ago, the 41-year-old had to give up teaching kickboxing classes to pick up his wife from work every day after gunmen robbed and sexually assaulted her at a bus stop.\n\nif it weren't for brazil's strict firearms legislation, he said, he'd buy a glock pistol to keep at work, and guns for his wife, sister and parents to defend themselves in what has become the world's most murderous country.\n\nbrazil racked up nearly 64,000 homicides in 2017, the highest overall number in the world. over 70% of those were committed with firearms, widely available to criminals on the black market. here in são paulo, a megalopolis of 12 million people, over a quarter of residents say they have been held up at gunpoint at some moment in their lives, according to a study this year by the city's business school insper.\n\nit's not fair, we've become hostages in our own country, said mr. sotero júnior. we can't take it anymore.\n\nnow, brazil is set to embark on an experiment that will determine what happens when you loosen gun restrictions in a country battling an overpowering wave of gun crime.\n\nto read more from the wall street journal, click here.
according to new york governor andrew cuomo, his leadership during the covid-19 pandemic has been worthy of many rewards: a new york times bestseller on leadership, a covid mountain poster he commissioned to be made and sold, an emmy, a ted kennedy award and a birthday party that you could attend virtually for $1,000 with a check made out to the andrew cuomo reelection campaign.\n\nif you ask those who lost loved ones in nursing homes, as my family did in 2020, his leadership has been a failure starting with his march 25 order to put covid positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days, and the subsequent cover-up of the total number of seniors we've lost since then.\n\nif cuomo had not spent valuable time promoting and celebrating himself for months, missing meetings with the white house in the fall and instead had prepared for the massive vaccine roll-out here in new york, maybe we wouldn't have the mess and mass confusion that is currently happening across the state.\n\none of the biggest problems we're facing right now is the complicated hierarchy that's been created designating who gets the vaccine first, and the very strict fines that are being implemented for hospitals who gave shots to anyone not on a prioritized list.\n\ncuomo's nursing home coronavirus policy: admin refuses record requests for study absolving him on deaths\n\neven the new york times has been getting tough with its headlines on what was happening:\n\nnew york's strict vaccine guidelines forced one clinic to throw away doses after it couldn't find eligible people\n\nwhy 300 doses of vaccine sat unused in freezer for 2 weeks…\n\nonce the vaccine distribution plan began, people started to notice who took priority first, and who wasn't being included. new york city mayor bill de blasio noticed that some first responders and those over the age of 70 were not at the front of the line:\n\nwe are not allowed by state law to give a single shot to a single new yorker over 75. he announced in a tweet.\n\nthe mayor went on talk shows and social media to ask why his own father wasn't allowed to get vaccinated yet and listened to many senior citizens raising their voices as to why they couldn't be prioritized for the vaccine since they were clearly the ones who needed it most.\n\ncuomo's book touting 'leadership' during pandemic released just before huge spike in covid cases, pundit notes\n\nthe shaming worked, and suddenly, cuomo announced that the elderly and city workers were now included. he said in a press conference on friday:\n\non monday, you can start to schedule appointments. pharmacies will start coming online, some on monday, more on wednesday…\n\nbut the governor never officially said when they could begin or how the registration would happen.\n\nny gov. cuomo's tone shifts after months of coronavirus lockdowns\n\nover the weekend we started to see reports about what a massive undertaking this distribution is and who might have a problem signing up.\n\nin a series of tweets new york city comptroller scott m. stringer wrote that the process of making appointments for the vaccination is complicated and buggy. especially for people over 75:\n\nthe @nychealthy site has a multi-step verification process just to set up an account, and then a six-step process to set up an appointment. along the way, there are as many as 51 questions of fields in addition to uploading images of your insurance card.\n\nall of this will be particularly challenging for populations that struggle with digital literacy and digital access – who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and who need to vaccine the most.\n\nnew york assemblyman ron kim, who is the chairman of the aging committee tweeted in response to stringer's tweet:\n\nfirst, it should be a two-step verification process to vaccinate older adults. but fixing hospital vaccination screening process is not the issue. why did the governor punt this to underfunded hospitals in the first place? why didn't the governor trust local protocols?\n\nkim told me in a text that he had informally surveyed some doctors and asked them why they thought the governor decided to trust hospitals to vaccinate the population. he says they overwhelmingly told him it's to make private hospitals look good.\n\ncritics mock ny gov. cuomo's sudden denunciation of lockdowns, suggest trump hacked his twitter account\n\nbill hammond is the senior fellow for health policy at empire center and has been one of the biggest advocates on transparency with the cuomo administration.\n\ni asked him in a text why this is so hard to do.\n\ngetting 8.3 million new york city residents organized to do anything is going to be hard. i'm struck by the lack of preparation. they could have foreseen the need for a registration system months ago. as it is, they seem to be managing things on the fly.\n\nhammond says he can see why they would want people to register for an appointment, to avoid crowding at vaccination sites. but if you're going to do that, it needs to be as simple as possible.\n\nideally, there would be one system for the city, and maybe the whole state. instead, it looks like we will have three.\n\nclick here for complete coronavirus coverage\n\ni then asked him why the governor decided to put this all on the shoulders of the hospital system.\n\nhere's his answer:\n\nhe evidently decided [that] they and their members (who are after all very smart and capable organizations) were better prepared to handle this job than city and county officials. the city's website rollout is probably the kind of thing he was worried about. but hospitals can't do everything. they have no particular experience of running mass vaccinations.\n\nthere are many reports showing every county in new york state has been planning and rehearsing this process of mass vaccinations for years.\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\nhammond thinks the preparations never included setting up websites, and that it's better handled statewide. but, the governor should've known how hard this would be from the beginning.\n\nhe should have been working on exactly these issues since the summer or early fall. not involving the counties — who had already done some the prep work — seems like a major mistake, he told me.\n\nadd this to the list of the many mistakes the governor has made over the last 10 months, but won't answer for. he seemed to escape widespread criticism of his lethal executive order in march and the thousands of seniors who subsequently died. but maybe now people are taking notice:\n\nchris @masterjohn wrote:\n\nif cuomo's march directive forbidding nursing homes from preventing readmission of then infected covid-19 positive patients didn't convince you he hates old people, maybe the 51 step process they take to get vaccines with millions of dollars in fines will convince you.\n\nvoices for seniors, a group of grieving families that advocate for accountability, change and reform for our seniors, responded on twitter:\n\ngovernor cuomo and dr. zucker have made it clear: they feel our seniors are disposable. there's no other explanation for their continued and criminal mismanagement of everything covid; from nursing home policies to vaccine distribution.\n\nand now, with so many lives to try to save, maybe the governor should spend some time truly leading.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nbecause if the governor didn't learn this lesson in the spring, our most vulnerable need to be at the front of the line so that we can protect them and hopefully save their lives.\n\nafter all the loved ones we lost, it's the least he can do for the ones who are still with us.\n\nclick here to read more from janice dean
as the third day of the ongoing impeachment trial of president trump wrapped up in the senate chamber, most of the drama was elsewhere -- with one witness for the democrats accusing a republican senator of defamation and slander after she questioned his patriotism and implicated him in a scheme to take down trump from inside the white house.\n\nthe off-field spat began thursday evening on twitter, when tennessee gop sen. marsha blackburn quoted the commanding officer of lt. col. alexander vindman as saying that vindman was a political activist in uniform.\n\nvindman, a national security council official, testified during house democrats' impeachment inquiry last year that trump's ukraine dealings left him in a state of shock, and democrats were quoting from vindman's remarks during the senate trial on thursday. vindman has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower who flagged trump's fateful july 25 phone call with ukraine's president -- a claim that republicans have questioned, because under cross-examination, vindman apparently admitted to leaking the contents of trump's call to the whistleblower.\n\nat the time, california democratic rep. adam schiff, presiding over the house impeachment inquiry, shut down gop attempts to press vindman as to whom he had leaked information about trump's call, saying it would potentially reveal the whistleblower's identity.\n\nblackburn tweeted as schiff spoke on thursday evening: adam schiff is hailing alexander vindman as an american patriot. how patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of russia, america's greatest enemy? ... alexander vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the president's july 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' over a policy dispute with the president! how is that not vindictive?\n\nschiff, in major reversal, admits he should have been clear about his own contact with the whistleblower\n\nit makes sense that alexander vindman leaked the july 25th phone call to his friend (aka the 'whistleblower'), blackburn continued. they both have lots in common: —held the same nsc job —liberals who worked under obama —wanted to take out trump.\n\nthe whistleblower's attorney, mark zaid, has openly recruited potential informants from within the intelligence community since 2017, when he declared that a coup has started against trump and predicted that impeachment would follow. zaid also attempted to solicit prominent actors to raise awareness to his efforts to oust trump, which began years before trump's call with ukraine's leader that ultimately led to his impeachment. zaid has further acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with a prominent 2020 democratic presidential candidate, but has not commented on specifics.\n\nvindman's legal team fired back within hours.\n\nthis difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose, david pressman, a lawyer with boies, schiller & flexner llp representing alexander vindman, said in a statement obtained by fox news. lieutenant colonel alexander vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country. he believes in our country. and he believes in our country's great institutions, including the united states senate.\n\ningraham investigation: more to uncover concerning bidens, burisma\n\npressman added: that a member of the senate – at a moment when the senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility – would choose to take to twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. while senator blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, lieutenant colonel vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\n\nspeaking to the ingraham angle late thursday, blackburn doubled down, saying that she has spoken to many members of the military who have a problem with the way vindman circumvented the chain of command to try to undermine trump's foreign policy.\n\nwe honor the service of every man and woman in uniform, blackburn told anchor laura ingraham. you look at what his commanders said. he has a problem with his judgment. that's been pointed out. he had one commander who said he is a political activist in uniform. he has had problems with going outside of his chain of command, which is what he did here.\n\ni talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, blackburn went on. they have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. what we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. we want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.\n\n'coup has started,' whistleblower attorney promised in 2017 tweets\n\nat one point during his impeachment testimony last year, vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by republican ohio rep. brad wenstrup. vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about trump's july phone call with the nsc's tim morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. but, under questioning from wenstrup, morrison confirmed that vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that vindman testified morrison was unreachable.\n\nmorrison further testified he had heard others express concern that vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. asked about that allegation, vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.\n\nmeanwhile, it remained unclear whether vindman -- or any other witnesses -- would appear at the senate trial, with trump attorney jay sekulow telling reporters he didn't expect democrats would present a compelling enough case to justify that step, but that it was still too early to discuss the issue.\n\nchief justice roberts admonishes both sides, as first day of impeachment trial erupts into shouting match after midnight\n\non the whole, senators generally seemed somewhat more alert on thursday, the third full day of the ongoing senate impeachment trial and the second full day of the democrats' opening arguments in the case.\n\nit was a long day, alaska gop sen. lisa murkowski, a key moderate swing vote, told fox news as the day wrapped on thursday. i was one pooped puppy.\n\nshe said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. on wednesday, murkowski said she was offended when democratic impeachment manager jerry nadler, d-n.y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from chief justice john roberts.\n\non his way out of the senate on thursday, though, nadler said he was confident.\n\ni think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, nadler told fox news. the evidence is overwhelming. the president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. and as i said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say. it won't be refutations of the evidence; there won't be any new evidence, there will just be criticisms of the house managers, of our procedures, all irrelevant to the charges against the president.\n\nfrom the senate gallery on thursday, senators could be seen sitting in their seats for longer periods and intently taking what appeared to be more detailed notes than they were the previous two days. multiple senators told fox news they believe that's because senators are more rested today after the session on tuesday drifted into wednesday, before adjourning at 1:50 a.m. et.\n\nthe day brought few new arguments, as democrats focused primarily on the abuse of power impeachment article instead of the obstruction of congress charge. democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former vice president joe biden did anything improper in dealings with ukraine, and that president trump sought a political investigation of biden by ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.\n\nthere was no basis for the investigation the president was pursuing and pushing. none. he was doing it only for his own political benefit, said rep. sylvia garcia, d-texas.\n\nsimilarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by trump and his allies that ukraine meddled in the 2016 u.s. election. although democrats -- and some news outlets, including the associated press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the u.s. election. additionally, a 2017 investigative report by politico found extensive efforts by ukrainians to hurt trump's presidential campaign.\n\nimpeachment backfire? key moderate republican says nadler's aggressive remarks have 'offended' senate\n\ntrump put himself first, ahead of u.s. policy and the national interest, schiff, acting as democrats' lead prosecutor, told the senate.\n\nadded new york rep. hakeem jeffries: the decision to grant or withhold an oval office meeting with [ukrainian] president zelensky had serious security concerns for both ukraine and the united states.\n\nyesterday, trump and even some left-of-center commentators mocked schiff for suggesting that trump must be removed by the senate because the 2020 election is already compromised. schiff also implied russia might invade the united states.\n\non thursday, during his closing remarks, schiff changed the argument somewhat. invoking vindman's statement that here, right matters, schiff said that trump needed to be removed because he was dangerous and trusted his personal attorney over the intelligence community.\n\nadditionally, schiff said trump could not be trusted in the event that russian hackers hypothetically attempted to publicize internal documents related to potential biden corruption.\n\nearlier in the day, democrats were laughing along as schiff joked that trump had made a religious man out of vladimir putin,'' a reference to a comment by putin last november: thank god,'' he told an economic forum in moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the u.s. elections anymore; now they're accusing ukraine.\n\ni was one pooped puppy. — alaska gop sen. lisa murkowski\n\nthe theory that blames ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges. trump is accused of seeking the ukraine investigation — and a probe of joe biden and his son hunter — for his own political benefit while holding back congressionally approved military aid as leverage.\n\nschiff warns russians could invade the u.s., says 2020 election is compromised so senators need to remove trump now\n\nthe white house and some congressional republicans have raised questions about hunter biden's lucrative job on the board of a ukrainian natural gas company, and joe biden's successful efforts to force the firing of a corrupt ukrainian prosecutor. biden was overseeing ukraine policy as vice president while hunter made big money in ukraine, and hunter got the job after testing positive for cocaine in the navy reserves.\n\nduring the house impeachment proceedings, a career state department employee testified that he had flagged hunter biden's apparent conflict of interest at the time but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office.\n\nsen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., vowed that hunter's actions would soon play a large role in the trial.\n\ni know a lot about the trump family and their dealings in russia, graham said. i don't know anything about the biden connection. you're going to hear more about that.\n\nas senators sat through endless hours of arguments on impeachment, they found a new outlet to focus their attention: fidget spinners.\n\nsen. richard burr, r-n.c., handed out the toys to his colleagues before thursday's trial proceedings began. a fidget spinner is a small toy designed to be spun between the fingers, relieving stress or boredom.\n\ninside the chamber, restless lawmakers struggle to pay attention as senate trial drags on\n\nburr was seen playing with a blue spinner while listening to arguments by rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., an impeachment manager.\n\nother senators, including sen. tom cotton, r-ark., and pat toomey, r-pa., were also seen with spinners on their desks.\n\nwhile senators are pledged to silence during the trial proceedings — and deprived of their phones and other electronics — they are speaking out during breaks in the action.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., meanwhile, rebutted republican senators who lamented they heard nothing new from house prosecutors. republicans voted nine times this week to block the democrats' proposed amendments for new witnesses and documents.\n\nif they want new stuff, there is plenty of it,'' schumer said at a news conference before thursday's session. as the [impeachment] managers made clear, a lot of the documents are sitting there, all compiled, all ready to go, with simply a vote of four republicans to subpoena them.''\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ndemocrats are expected to wrap up their arguments when the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. et friday, with trump's legal team set to make its case for up to three days beginning saturday. sekulow deflected rumors that the defense may wrap up in a single day.\n\nwe're going to use a sufficient amount of time to defend our case and point out the inconsistencies of their case. we're not going to run out the clock,'' he said. i am confident that whether it is [completed] saturday or monday or tuesday that the case will be made defending the president. i have no doubt.''\n\nfox news' chad pergram, marisa schultz, caroline mckee, mike emanuel, thomas firth, andrew o'reilly, jason donner, and adam shaw contributed to this report, as well as the associated press.
cap-and-trade energy tax legislation appears stalled, at least for now, in the u.s. senate. but that doesn't mean the cap-and-trade energy tax isn't imminent.\n\nsenate environment committee chairwoman barbara boxer hasn't even introduced the bill yet; new senate agriculture committee chairwoman blanche lincoln has declared the house bill dead on arrival; and there are several other cross-cutting controversies that divide democrats on the bill. the obama administration is unfazed. they are moving full steam ahead with an even more costly regulatory scheme in the name of global warming�shoehorning the regulation of greenhouse gases into the 1970 clean air act, a bill passed before anyone had ever thought of global warming and that couldn't be less suited to the task.\n\ndriving the push for this massive power grab and circumvention of the elected branches is a key white house official who avoided senate confirmation by being installed not as epa director, but instead as white house climate czar: carol browner.\n\nlong before the supreme court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, massachusetts v. epa, that the epa has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the clean air act, browner (then epa director under president bill clinton) had her general counsel, jonathan cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the epa possessed such a power. at the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that congress would never allow. now it's happening, and browner is right at the center of it.\n\nmary nichols, the chair of the california air resources board, has confirmed that browner was the lead white house negotiator in establishing new automobile emissions standards, which for the first time rely on epa's presumed authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the 1970 clean air act. nichols told the new york times that browner quietly orchestrated private discussions from the white house with auto industry officials. we put nothing in writing, ever,� nichols said.\n\nleft unchecked, browner will move beyond automobiles to epa's entire staggering 18,000-page blueprint for regulating the u.s. economy. it will eventually regulate everything that moves (light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, motorcycles, planes, trains, ships, boats, tractors, mining equipment, rvs, lawn mowers, fork lifts, and just about every other piece of equipment that has a motor) and lots of things that don't (any building over 100,000 square feet could be pulled in, along with smaller carbon dioxide emitters, like restaurants, schools, and hospitals that have commercial kitchens with gas burners).\n\nit's bad enough that the epa is moving ahead with plans to pursue expensive global warming regulations instead of leaving the complex issue to congress, the branch of government constitutionally tasked with making laws. it's made much worse by the fact that the effort is being led not by lisa jackson, the duly confirmed and therefore accountable administrator of the epa, but by carol browner, the unaccountable, unconfirmed white house climate czar.\n\nbrowner was made a czar so that her powers could be more sweeping than they would be in any single official appointment�witness her cross-agency role in the secret automobile emissions regulations�and to avoid the scrutiny of senate confirmation, which would have been difficult for browner. since leaving the clinton administration she has moved further left, even becoming one of the 14 members of the socialist international commission for a sustainable world society� on whose web site she was listed as a member as recently as january 5, the day she was named white house climate czar.\n\n\n\nthis commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis. it's far outside the political mainstream and would have presented serious problems for centrist democrats facing a confirmation vote.\n\nit's one thing for president obama to surround himself with the advisers he'd like to have, but it's another to bestow on them sweeping powers to broker secret negotiations and push forward vast new regulations that could cost american families thousands of dollars.\n\nfortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the u.s. senate stand on allowing carol browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. sen. david vitter of louisiana has introduced an amendment (sa 2440) to the department of the interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for browner's policy directives. any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just carol browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.\n\nmr. kerpen is director of policy for americans for prosperity. he can be contacted through philkerpen.com. follow him on twitter and facebook. his free two-minute podcast is available daily.
president donald trump's national security adviser, john bolton, says the u.s. military withdrawal from northeastern syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the islamic state group, and turkey assuring the safety of kurdish fighters allied with the united states.\n\nbolton, who is in israel to reassure the u.s. ally of the trump-ordered withdrawal, says there is no timetable for the pull-out of american forces in northeastern syria, but insists it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nbolton said on sunday that the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nhis comments mark the first public confirmation the drawdown has been slowed, as trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of defense secretary jim mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.

disappointing! sick! outrageous! pro-trump protesters inside the u.s. capitol must stand down at once!\n\nit's hard to express my shock and sadness at seeing america's legislative palace breached, a door to the u.s. house broken, and senators and house members hunkering down, apparently in gas masks. most astonishing is to see those involved in this violence not waving antifa flags but, instead, trump and maga banners.\n\nit's only jan. 6, but the 2021 nobel prizes for unforced errors and a suicidal leap from the moral high ground go to the pro-trump protesters marauding through the halls of the people's house.\n\ngop politicians condemn violence at capitol, call for an end to riots\n\nit would be bad enough if the acts of terrorism now being perpetrated by this mob were underway while house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., banged her gavel and shut down any objections to electoral college votes that many of my fellow trump fans believe are tainted by ballot irregularities.\n\non the contrary, 180 degrees, the house and senate were debating republican objections to arizona's electoral college votes. sen. ted cruz r-texas, was making his case to his colleagues, with his usual eloquence.\n\nrep. andy biggs, r-ariz., head of the freedom caucus, rose to state his concerns about his own state's electoral college votes. he even presented something that should not have existed: a stack of voter registrations that were recorded after the grand canyon state's statutory deadline. this is precisely the sort of evidence that the president's supporters have wanted for weeks to be aired in public.\n\nthus, the sheer mind-blowing stupidity of the buffoons who stormed the capitol. they attacked congress exactly as it was doing precisely what these people wanted done. this would be akin to antifa breaking through the windows of the capitol just as a democratic u.s. senate voted on final passage of vermont socialist sen. bernie sanders' medicare-for-all legislation.\n\ndumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!\n\nwith guns drawn on the u.s. house floor (!), and reports of one person shot, this is the most vicious breach of the capitol since the british army attacked in 1814, during one of the most ominous moments of the war of 1812.\n\nin an astonishing act of self-sabotage, these idiots now have made it enormously difficult for those of us who admire president trump for his enormous domestic and international policy victories.\n\ninstead, any discussion of the highest median household income in american history, the lowest poverty rate ever, the complete liquidation of isis, and two covid-19 vaccines in nine months will be answered with, oh, you mean the boob whose people assaulted the u.s. capitol?\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthese un-american anarchists have performed an enormous disservice to president trump, the america first movement, the more than 74 million voters who cast our ballots for him in november, and our beloved united states of america.\n\nthose intruders in the capitol need to back off, evacuate, go home, and ponder the evil that they did.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthe capitol police and district of columbia metropolitan police should arrest everyone who is in violation of local and federal laws. and the suspects should be prosecuted and, if convicted, imprisoned for the maximum terms allowed by law.\n\npresident trump did the right thing wednesday afternoon. he issued a video statement from the white house via twitter and told his overzealous backers to beat it. they should heed his words at once: i know how you feel. but go home and go home in peace.\n\nclick here for more from deroy murdock
it's official. by executive fiat, president obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the united states.\n\nhow did we get here? didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?\n\nif obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the fifth amendment. he is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nconsider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. a year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, actually, i don't. three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, the notion that somehow i can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.\n\nwell, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. why the metamorphosis? what changed? the law and the constitution are still the same. which leaves obama. when it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. he never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.\n\npresident obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that congress failed to act. no, mr. president, congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.\n\nthere is a difference. a determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. this is how the framers constructed our system of government. congress considers and debates a great many bills. not all of them pass. this is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. it constitutes a prudent and calculated process.\n\nbut the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. he wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. he well knows he is exceeding his power. in 2011, he said, i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the (immigration) on my own. but that's not how our system works. that's not how our democracy functions. that's not how our constitution is written. he was right. it was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.\n\nnow, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, obama is twisting the law, ignoring the constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. for years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, i'm president, i'm not king. apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. in truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.\n\nrecently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, well, actually, my position hasn't changed. after the laughter died down, the washington post fact checker gave obama an upside-down pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.\n\nthe president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. here are three ways this is happening:\n\n1. distorting prosecutorial discretion\n\npresident obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.\n\nin past decisions, the u.s. supreme court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. it is subject to restrictions. the doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. it applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.\n\nby contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.\n\nit is true that president ronald reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. but his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law congress had already passed. his exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, president george h. w. bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by congress. the point is instructive. the actions by reagan and bush are not a supporting precedent for mr. obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.\n\nhowever, president obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. it has become his political gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with congress. he contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. he treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.\n\n2. usurping legislative authority\n\nour constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. congress is vested with writing laws and the president is charged with executing those laws. this is especially true when it comes to immigration.\n\nat the end of the 19th century, the supreme court declared that congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. derived from article 1, section 8 of the constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. as the high court observed, over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete.\n\nyet president obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. in so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. he is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.\n\n3. breaching his sworn duty\n\npresident obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. article ii, section 3 requires that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. he cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. to infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. president obama admitted as much when he said, the fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that i have to enforce. he was specifically talking about immigration laws.\n\nin 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.\n\nif president obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? after all, he has frequently threatened, where congress won't act, i will. what is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? or to act where congress has declined or refused to act? can he abolish certain tax laws because congress chooses to keep them? can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? if so, why even have a legislative branch of government? what's the point of a constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?\n\nmen like madison, jefferson and adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. they knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. they knew that absolute power corrupts.\n\nand they feared future presidents like mr. obama.\n\nin the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. they held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. even lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the civil war were grounded in the constitution and the rule of law.\n\nbut, like the title of his autobiography, mr. obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. it is no more evident than now.

as a consumer of political content, i'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and tv segments analyzing the importance of the georgia senate run-off elections on tuesday. control of the senate means, in no uncertain terms, that president-elect joe biden and vice-president-elect kamala harris will be able to bring their agenda to life… or not.\n\nit was central to both biden's primary and general election campaigns that he was the candidate best suited to be able to work with republicans and i believe that's very much the case.\n\nhe has decades long relationships with key gop officials, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and has shown throughout his career that he is very effective at reaching across the aisle to work on bipartisan legislation.\n\nbut for all of biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that republicans have no interest in working with him. biden can make all the overtures he wants, mcconnell has been clear. he sees democrats as the enemy.\n\ndonna brazile: gop senate candidates in georgia are trump puppets who act like contestants on 'the apprentice'\n\nit follows that divided government isn't good enough. in order for anything to be accomplished in washington, and i mean anything, mcconnell cannot remain in control.\n\nit's underrated and often forgotten just how sick americans are of the inaction in washington. congress enjoys an approval rating in the low teens on a good day and voters overwhelmingly believe representatives are more concerned with themselves and playing politics than what's best for americans.\n\nneed evidence? look no further than the drama over the covid-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the gop still blocked it. they can't even work together with democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.\n\nthere will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the american people soon after biden's inauguration. if democratic senate candidates raphael warnock and joe ossoff are in d.c., that will be possible. if republican sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue win on tuesday, mcconnell will block that desperately needed assistance.\n\nthis is about so much more than covid assistance, though. if democrats hold a senate majority, biden should be able to make progress on key issues like the economy, health care, immigration and climate change.\n\nthese are policy areas where there is broad agreement amongst americans.\n\nnearly two thirds of americans favor increased taxes on the wealthiest americans. that includes 77% of democrats and 53% of republicans. and over two thirds support an increase in the federal minimum wage. while a majority of republicans don't support a $15 minimum wage, there is broad support for a raise beyond the current rate of $7.25.\n\nthe affordable care act currently enjoys a 53% favorability rating as compared to just 34% who oppose it in the latest kaiser family foundation polling. nearly 75% believe that it's important that people with pre-existing conditions remain protected.\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\non immigration, americans broadly support legal status for daca kids. recent polling shows 75% hold this position. they also believe immigrants are good for the country, this includes a majority of republicans, and bring with them a strong work ethic and talent.\n\nand on climate change, nearly two-thirds of americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change. they also want the government to go further to reduce greenhouse gases, restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthese aren't democratic positions, they are american positions. but only one party will ensure they come to life: the democrats. these are all positions and policies biden will be able to tackle if democrats also control the senate.\n\na win for warnock and ossoff is a win for american priorities.\n\nclick here to read more from jessica tarlov

'if his past statements are any indication,' then trump's speech 'will be full of malice and misinformation,' the democratic leaders said monday night in a joint statement calling for democrats to be given equal airtime. as the shutdown of roughly a quarter of the government stretched into its 18th day, both sides remained staunchly opposed to each others' proposals for a deal to fund nine federal departments.\n\n\n\nbraun, manchin try to stop congress from getting paid during shutdowns - indianapolis star: in his first act as a u.s. senator, indiana republican mike braun is expected to introduce a bipartisan bill that would prevent members of congress — including himself — from being paid during government shutdowns. currently, lawmakers are still paid when they are unable to pass spending bills by the deadline, while most federal workers are not. the latest partial government shutdown is now in its third week, as democrats and president donald trump continue to clash over border security on the country's southern border. trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall. braun's bill, co-authored by west virginia democrat joe manchin, would also prohibit retroactive pay for lawmakers.\n\n\n\ntrump changes rules to let tax refunds flow during shutdown - wsj: the internal revenue service will pay tax refunds even though the agency is subject to the federal government shutdown, after the trump administration reversed a longstanding policy. monday's decision removes one of the biggest potential pains for many americans from a prolonged shutdown. even if the impasse over a border wall lasts into the income tax-filing season scheduled to start jan. 28, the administration's move will let hundreds of billions of dollars flow to households. the administration is trying to make the shutdown as 'painless as possible consistent with the law,' russell vought, the acting director of the white house office of management and budget, told reporters. 'we're going to continue to take steps like that to mitigate the impact,' vice president mike pence said of the tax refunds.\n\n\n\npence diminished - the atlantic: according to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as trump's friction with congress has increased, pence's clout has suffered. two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that pence was leading the trump administration's negotiations on border security. yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending pence to a meeting that trump himself said would yield nothing. this, coupled with the moments over the past month when trump has publicly undermined pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.\n\n\n\nshutdown stories: florida prison guards pay the price - nyt: a federal prison here in florida's rural panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during hurricane michael in october, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in yazoo city, miss., more than 400 miles away. since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. as of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip. 'you add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said mike vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union. if nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in washington…\n\n\n\nwilliamson: you ain't seen nothing yet - national review: this is what happens when a relatively small group of federal workers don't get their paychecks. imagine what it is going to look like when the social security checks stop coming. around 2038, less than 20 years out, total spending on the major entitlements — social security, medicare, medicaid — plus interest on the debt will exceed all federal tax revenue. put another way, come 2038, if we put every dollar uncle stupid collects in taxes toward social security, medicare, medicaid, and interest on the debt, all of that money combined will not cover those expenses. fiscal armageddon is coming.\n\n\n\nthe rulebook: crushing it\n\nthe several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts. – james madison, federalist no. 47\n\n\n\ntime out: cheers\n\nsmithsonian: ['drunk history,' the comedy central show whose sixth season premieres january 15] features guests, often celebrities, telling historical tales while drinking with host derek waters and a cast re-enacting the stories as they're told, lip-synching to the narration. … waters first got the idea for 'drunk history' when his friend 'new girl' actor jake johnson drunkenly tried to tell him a story about otis redding's 1967 plane crash death. when waters told another actor friend, michael cera of 'arrested development' fame, about it, they decided to shoot an episode with cera playing alexander hamilton in a retelling of his fatal duel with aaron burr (this was, it should be noted, eight years before hamilton's off-broadway debut). the clip blew up online with the help of cera's star power, on the rise in 2007 thanks to superbad and juno; it's gotten more than 7.5 million views on youtube to date.\n\n\n\nflag on the play?

pamplona, colombia – a little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. it's the only thing she has to call her own.\n\nboys nearby play soccer with an empty soda bottle. men, reduced to tears, hide away in makeshift tents, counting pennies to feed their families.\n\nit first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, todd chapman, the u.s ambassador to ecuador, told fox news. people don't leave their children behind because they want to. it is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.\n\nthe depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just latin america - with little end in sight. it's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to moises rendon, associate director and fellow for the center for strategic and international studies (csis).\n\nyou have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. combine all these aspects together, and venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.\n\nresponse for venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.\n\nneighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.\n\nin most towns and cities across latin america, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.\n\nand for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable venezuelans. officials refer to those leaving venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.\n\nalthough more than 3.3 million venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in ecuador – have applied for asylum.\n\nmany just can't feed their children so their focus is on just getting a job, anything until they can go home again, explained unhcr's representative in ecuador, maría clara martín. i have rarely seen a venezuelan who says they don't want to return.\n\nother professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various ngo and un bodies are endeavoring to address.\n\nsantiago chavez, ecuador's vice minister of mobility, said there are more than 300,000 venezuelans currently living in ecuador, with about three-quarters having entered in an irregular – otherwise illegal – way.\n\nthe effort that ecuador is having to do here is proportional to germany allowing a million syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, chavez said. ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.\n\njobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. antonio ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of caracas and opposition leader now exiled in spain, told fox news more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.\n\nwhile fleeing to another nation provides some hope, most resort to street selling.\n\nat the resting house in quito, ecuador a group of 20-something former students and professionals take turns selling cookies in different parts of the street.\n\ni've only been able to send money home to venezuela on two occasions, lamented yondel alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. my wife is in colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in venezuela. my other children are with my mother in venezuela and i have to stay in ecuador to try to work.\n\nthe impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to chile or colombia, while others ventured to peru or argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.\n\nit's really rough what the migrants have gone through. everyone is frustrated, depressed, said marcelo viteli, the general manager of the resting house where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.\n\ninside latin american 'amazing race' star's dramatic escape from venezuela\n\ntrump administration walking back obama-era foreign policy mistakes in burma\n\nit wasn't so long ago that colombians were fleeing en masse to venezuela – then the richest nation in latin america, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. while the tables have abruptly turned, most colombians are eager to return the generosity.\n\nan array of colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.\n\nat one small hut near the border town of cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the samaritan's purse donation mound.\n\nfurther along the winding road, colombian local marta duque – who opened the home to help venezuelans after feeling a deep sense of sadness for what they were enduring – say she, too, has been threatened with fines and being arrested, given the hazard of having scores of migrants pouring out into the streets.\n\nbut she refuses to give up and shut down. i have to help because i understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, duque said.\n\none young mother, marisela, cradles her young son on duque's floor, and encourages him to take deep breaths.\n\nhe is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. life there is chaotic in every sense. i hope to get him medicine in colombia. but without government change, there is no going home.\n\nthe acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to venezuelans, but to the region at large. the country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across latin america.\n\nthe migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in may this year. a second wave hit in october, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.\n\npeople who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. now they have absolutely nothing, said victor bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in colombia. in just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. something must be done. the humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.\n\nboth government and non-governmental professionals tending to the regional calamity concurred that this year there has been a profile shift in those fleeing.\n\nin the first few years of the meltdown, which gained momentum in 2015, those with some finances and education were able to buy plane tickets out. but as the situation has slowly deteriorated, those from poorer backgrounds started to escape.\n\none u.s government official closely monitoring the case told fox news that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.\n\nexperts surmise that at least one in 10 leaving venezuela now are disabled, and have pointed to an uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing international borders – mostly boys between the ages of 15 and 17. but many don't have documentation.\n\nultimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.\n\nbut with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.\n\nwe are trying to establish programs that can be of benefit to both ecuadorians and venezuelans, and address the welfare concerns of both, said the international organization for migration (iom) ecuador's chief of mission, manuel hoff.\n\nin several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.\n\nyet the end game is unclear. all signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after january 10, when maduro begins another presidential term. though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.\n\nso maduro will after jan. 9 be deemed illegitimate in the eyes of most international players – including the united states – which has been mulling designating venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism alongside iran, north korea, syria, and sudan.\n\nyet venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of cuba, iran, china, russia and turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. turkish president tayyip erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against venezuela, and this year turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from venezuela. and russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.\n\nthe maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the us- and us-supported political foe for waging economic war.\n\nover the past fiscal year, the united states has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the department of state and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional venezuela contingency. in september, the u.s. pledged a further $48 million. moreover, the department of defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.\n\nthe number of venezuelans fleeing is expected to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, according to the united nations, in what has become the largest exodus in modern latin american history.\n\nthe u.n high commissioner for refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.\n\nit is forecasted that colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected peru will have 1.4 million venezuelans by the end of 2019. ecuador, brazil, as well as other countries in the southern cone, central america and the caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in venezuelan arrivals.\n\nthe un is projecting that at least two million more venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.\n\nnonetheless, chapman, the american ambassador in ecuador, underscored the u.s is committed to the cause, and said the trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.\n\nwhat has been shocking to me is i am seeing parallels to other places i have worked – afghanistan and mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. people have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. it is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the venezuela crisis all the more important.
overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, house democrats on thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.\n\nalthough planned portions of the rules relating to the house's handling of obamacare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of new york democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez's opposition to the measure.\n\nthree republicans supported the democrats' rules, including pennsylvania rep. brian fitzpatrick, and new york reps. john katko and tom reed. in addition to ocasio-cortez, hawaii democratic rep. tulsi gabbard and california rep. ro khanna voted against the rules package.\n\non wednesday, ocasio-cortez vowed to join khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by house speaker nancy pelosi. that rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\n\nthe pay-go principle, ocasio-cortez charged in a tweet wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nwe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. but, pelosi deputy chief of staff drew hammill fired back, tweeting: a vote against the democratic rules package is a vote to let [director of the office of management and budget (omb)] mick mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing democratic initiatives and funding increases.\n\npay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nother rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through september 30 of the budget year once the house adopts a budget. the so-called gephardt rule had offered the house much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the house and senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.\n\nthe rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. the select committee on the climate crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when democrats last controlled the house. but, the house rules give the panel until march 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.\n\nand, although hats have been barred in the house chamber for more than a century, a new house rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. that means the rules will still preclude democratic florida rep. frederica wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the house floor -- but democratic minnesota rep. ilhan omar, a muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.\n\nadditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.\n\nportions of the rules had also provided that the house has the authority to defend obamacare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.\n\ndem introducing impeachment articles against trump on first day of new congress\n\nmeanwhile, house democrats thursday night debated a combined spending bill to end part of the government shutdown.\n\nthe house late thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the department of homeland security until feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. but the bill does not include any new wall money, and senate republicans and the white house have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. five republicans voted for the bill.\n\nanother piece of legislation proposed and debated by democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through sept. 30. that bill, which the white house has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. et, with seven republicans joining democrats to vote yea. the measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.\n\nin a news conference thursday night, pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since dec. 22 amid demands from the white house that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.\n\nhowever, pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.\n\nwe sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told reporters. the president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. and we will do that. and we will have a discussion. pelosi then interjected to remind hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. et, and joked that trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.\n\ntrump met with pelosi and other senior democrats at a contentious meeting on wednesday in the white house situation room, which included senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., interrupting homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen within five seconds, according to republicans at the meeting. the sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new congress was seated thursday.\n\nthe message is very simple: this is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, new york democratic rep. nita lowey, who chairs the house appropriations committee, said afterward.\n\nwatch: trump holds surprise press conference with border patrol union\n\nshortly after pelosi's historic return to the house speakership, trump made his first-ever appearance in the white house briefing room to congratulate pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.\n\ntogether with officials from the national border patrol council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, trump insisted that we need protection in our country.\n\ni promise you, if you interview border patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, brandon judd, the president of the border patrol union, told the media after trump's introductory remarks. i worked in naco, ariz., for ten years. we didn't have physical barriers in naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. we built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... we need those physical barriers and we appreciate president trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.\n\ntrump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional democrats. in a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on capitol hill, pelosi on thursday evening formally invited trump to deliver state of the union speech in congress on jan. 29.\n\nfox news' chad pergram and samuel chamberlain contributed to this report.
china believes president-elect joe biden represents a new window of hope for the country's relationship with the united states, according to state media.\n\nbiden's critics have expressed concern that he will take a friendlier stance toward china than president trump as tensions between the two rivals have risen after a trade battle and the spread of covid-19.\n\nchinese foreign minister wang yi told state media outlet cgtn last week that a new window of hope is opening with the incoming administration.\n\nthe biden administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with china, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation, wang said.\n\nbiden national security adviser attacked trump in interview with chinese state-run media\n\nhe added that the u.s. and china have run into unprecedented difficulties in the past few years, and some american politicians see china as the united states' so-called biggest threat, leading them to base china policy on serious misconceptions.\n\nsuch a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail, wang said.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nu.s.-china tensions have escalated under the trump administration due to a yearslong trade war between the two countries amid u.s. accusations of intellectual property theft, cyberattacks, fentanyl exports to the u.s. and other crimes; criticism related to the coronavirus pandemic; and china's human rights record with regard to muslim minority populations in its northeast region and hong kong.\n\ntrump has implemented strict sanctions on china since taking office and blacklisted dozens of chinese companies accused of facilitating human rights abuses against the country's uighur population.\n\nhunter biden in 2017 sent 'best wishes' from 'entire biden family' to china firm chairman, requested $10m wire\n\nchinese president xi jinping in november congratulated biden on winning the 2020 election, according to state media outlet xinhua.\n\nchinese president xi jinping on wednesday sent a message to joe biden to congratulate him on election as u.s. president, xinhua reported without adding further detail.\n\nbiden is expected to review the trump administration's china tariffs once the president-elect takes office, according to the wall street journal, though he has said he would not immediately remove tariffs.
japan on friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland china rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.\n\nfollowing an online uproar over the government's treatment of dr. li wenliang, 34, the ruling communist party said it was sending an investigation team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case.\n\nget fox business on the go by clicking here\n\ntwo docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in hong kong and japan.\n\nbefore friday's 41 confirmed cases, 20 infected passengers were escorted off the diamond princess at yokohama near tokyo. about 3,700 people have been confined aboard the ship.\n\nprime minister shinzo abe announced thursday that japan will deny entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship — holland america's cruise ship westerdam, on its way to okinawa from hong kong — because of suspected virus patients found on board. the seattle-based operator denied anyone had virus.\n\nchina's coronavirus outbreak kills 638, infects more than 31,400 as world struggles for a cure\n\nabe said the new immigration policy takes effect friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into japan.\n\nthe ship with more than 2,000 people was currently near ishigaki, one of okinawa's outer islands, and was seeking another port, said overseas travel agency official mie matsubara.\n\neveryone is starting to reject the ship and we are getting desperate, she said. we hope we can go somewhere so that passengers can land.\n\nat least four other cruise ships, two foreign and two japanese-operated, are headed to japan by the end of the month, transport minister kazuyoshi akaba said, urging port authorities around the country to turn them away.\n\ndr. li had worked at a hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak in the central city of wuhan. he was one of eight medical professionals in wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others when the government did not, writing on his twitter-like weibo account that on dec. 3 he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to sars, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak that the government initially tried to cover-up.\n\ntrump speaks to china's xi on phone about coronavirus and trade\n\nli wrote that after he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he was visited on jan. 3 by police, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to having spread falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued.\n\na copy of the statement signed by li and posted online accused him of making false statements and seriously disturbing social order.\n\nthis is a type of illegal behavior! the statement said.\n\nli wrote that he developed a cough on jan. 10, fever on jan. 11 and was hospitalized on jan. 12, after which he began having trouble breathing.\n\nhe also wrote that he had not in fact had his medical license revoked, a reference to the sort of extrajudicial retaliation the communist authorities meet out to rights lawyers and others seen as troublemakers.\n\nplease rest easy, i will most certainly actively cooperate with the treatment and seek to obtain an early discharge! li wrote on jan. 31. he posted again on feb. 1, saying he had been confirmed as having the virus.\n\non friday, the global times, a communist party newspaper and usual staunch defender of the authorities, reported that many said the experience of the eight 'whistleblowers' was evidence of local authorities' incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus.\n\nit quoted zeng guang, chief epidemiologist at the chinese center for disease control and prevention, as telling the paper's editor that we should highly praise the eight wuhan residents.\n\nthey were wise before the outbreak, zeng was quoted as saying. the paper also cited online voices saying local authorities owe li an apology. it quoted one posting as saying, we lost a hero. if his warning could send an alarm, the outbreak might not have continued to worsen, the posting said.\n\nlooking back, his professional sense of vigilance in particular is worthy of our respect, the paper said in an editorial.\n\nthe police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation's highest court. we have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors, a posting on the court's weibo account said.\n\nmeanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. doctors said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.\n\nchina's state media said friday that president xi jinping urged the u.s. to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with president donald trump.\n\na people's war against the virus has been launched, xi was quoted as saying by broadcaster cctv, using timeworn communist terminology. we hope the u.s. side can assess the epidemic in a calm manner and adopt and adjust its response measures in a reasonable way.\n\nbeijing has complained that the u.s. was flying its citizens out of wuhan but not providing any assistance to china.\n\nthe white house said trump expressed confidence in china's strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the outbreak.\n\nwuhan has built two new prefabricated hospitals in recent weeks and is adapting gymnasiums, exhibition centers and other spaces for patients were milder symptoms. thousands of additional military and civilian medical workers have been sent to the city.\n\nstill, those inside that quarantine area encompassing a population of around 50 million speak of a medical system completely overwhelmed.\n\nchen jiaxin, 22, told the associated press by phone from wuhan that his father fell ill on jan. 28 but had to return home because no hospital would accept him. when he called for an ambulance after his father's fever spiked on thursday morning, chen said he was told 400 people were waiting ahead of him.\n\nwe were just told to wait and wait, chen said.\n\nclick here to read more on fox business\n\ntesting of a new antiviral drug was set to begin on a group of patients thursday, the official xinhua news agency reported. the drug, remdesivir, is made by u.s. biotech company gilead sciences.\n\nwith the development of a vaccine months, or years, away, researchers are experimenting with the re-purposing of existing drugs used to treat viruses such as hiv.
democratic leaders are doubling down on accusations that president trump's description of a crisis at the u.s.-mexico border is manufactured, as the president prepares to visit the front-lines on the heels of his oval office address to the nation.\n\nthe response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.\n\ntrump plans to meet with congressional leaders once again in the situation room wednesday afternoon, ahead of his planned trip to the southern texas border on thursday. but past meetings have resulted in both sides digging in, with trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and democrats saying they won't entertain the discussion until congress passes and trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies.\n\ntuesday night's primetime address saw both camps drifting even further apart, with trump declaring a humanitarian and security crisis and vowing to protect america, so help me god – and democratic congressional leaders saying trump is working to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\n\ndems accuse trump of 'malice' after border speech\n\nspeaking wednesday on fox news' america's newsroom, democratic national committee chairman tom perez echoed senate minority leader chuck schumer's language.\n\nthis whole border security crisis … it really, i believe, is a manufactured crisis, he said, adding that it's distracting from issues like health care and education.\n\nthe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat; they are a humanitarian challenge, house speaker nancy pelosi said in the joint democratic rebuttal alongside schumer.\n\ntrump and his allies say democrats, many of whom supported border security measures in the past, are only bucking the calls now because of knee-jerk opposition to his administration.\n\nbut perez maintained that democrats believe in meaningful border security, and also believe a wall is not smart policy.\n\ntrump declares crisis at border\n\nhow the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. the mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on congress and the white house to forge a deal in the coming days.\n\nyet trump told congressional leaders the standoff could last months, even years, as he demands washington take action to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and criminals crossing the border.\n\non tuesday, trump underscored cases of americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including california police cpl. ronil singh, who was murdered the day after christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. the suspect had multiple prior arrests, and republicans have charged that california's sanctuary laws -- which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities -- led to singh's murder.\n\namerica's heart broke the day after christmas when a young police officer in california was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border, trump said. the life of an american hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\n\nhe asked, how much more american blood must be shed before congress does its job?\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\npelosi responded: president trump must stop holding the american people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\n\nfox news' gregg re and samuel chamberlain contributed to this report.

a u.s. judge on friday blocked the trump administration's most sweeping set of asylum restrictions less than two weeks before president-elect joe biden takes office.\n\nthe rules had been set to take effect monday. the court order has limited immediate impact because the government has largely suspended asylum at the u.s.-mexico border during the coronavirus pandemic, citing public health concerns.\n\nstill, letting the rules take effect would have been felt by some who can still claim asylum and make it significantly more difficult for all asylum-seekers once pandemic-related measures are lifted.\n\npresident trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.\n\ntrump extends restrictions on work visas, says pandemic still disrupts 'american livelihoods'\n\nthey sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. the restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the u.s.\n\nu.s. district judge james donato in san francisco sided with advocacy groups who sued, saying acting homeland security secretary chad wolf lacked authority to impose the sweeping rules.\n\ndonato, who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by president barack obama, wrote that wolf's appointment violated an established order of succession. he said it was the fifth time a court has ruled against homeland security on the same grounds.\n\nthe government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, donato wrote. this is a troubling litigation strategy. in effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.\n\nmexico seeks help to get covid-19 vaccines for migrants in us\n\ndonato said his ruling applies nationwide because limiting its reach would result in a fragmented and disjointed patchwork of immigration policy.\n\nit was not immediately clear if the trump administration would make an emergency appeal. the justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late friday.\n\naaron frankel, an attorney for plaintiffs, has called the rules nothing less than an attempt to end the asylum system.\n\nasylum is a legal protection designed for people fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership to a social group. any foreigner who steps on u.s. soil has a legal right to apply for asylum, according to u.s. asylum law and international treaty obligations.\n\nthe rules would narrow the types of persecution and severity of threats for which asylum is granted. applicants seeking protections on the basis of gender or those who claim they were targeted by gangs, rogue government officials or non-state organizations would likely not be eligible for asylum.\n\nimmigration judges would be directed to be more selective about granting asylum claims and allow them to deny most applications without a court hearing.\n\nas border numbers increase, cbp chief says us faces 'full-blown crisis' if trump-era policies end\n\nthey also would have weighed several new factors against an applicant's ability to win protections, among them failure to pay taxes. criminal records would still count against an asylum-seeker even if their convictions were expunged.\n\nunder pandemic-related measures in effect since march, about nine in every 10 people stopped at the border are immediately expelled on public health grounds. the rest are processed under immigration laws, which include the right to seek asylum.\n\ndonato took issue with how people came to lead the department of homeland security. wolf became acting secretary in november 2019, replacing kevin mcaleenan, who was also in an acting role. courts have ruled that wolf improperly leapfrogged to the top job from his position as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans.\n\ndonato, like other judges, said mcaleenan, who had been customs and border protection commissioner, also was promoted to the top homeland security job out of order, making his handover to wolf have no legal effect whatsoever.\n\nhomeland security has been without a senate-confirmed secretary since kirstjen nielsen resigned in april 2019.\n\nwhile the trump administration faced a legal setback, it's already instituted a raft of policies restricting asylum, including making asylum-seekers wait in mexico while their claims are heard in u.s. court.\n\nbiden is expected to reverse some of trump's restrictive asylum measures, including the remain in mexico policy, but recently said his administration would need probably the next six months to re-create a system that can process asylum-seekers to prevent a flood of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nalso friday, the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in richmond, virginia, ruled against the administration's policy that gave state and local governments the right to refuse to resettle refugees.\n\nthe three-judge panel said trump's executive order that required both state and local entities to give their consent before allowing refugees to be placed in their areas would undermine the 1980 refugee act. that law set by congress was designed to allow resettlement agencies to find the best place for a person to thrive while working with local and state officials.
tens of thousands of embryos are stuck in limbo in fertility clinics, leftovers from pregnancy attempts and broken dreams of parenthood.\n\nsome are outright abandoned by people who quit paying storage fees and can't be found. in other cases, couples are struggling with tough decisions.\n\njenny sammis can't bring herself to donate nearly a dozen of her extras to research. she and her husband agreed to do that when they made their embryos 15 years ago, but her feelings changed after using some of them to have children.\n\ni have these two gorgeous, smart people who came from this process, sammis said. these embryos are all like seeds that could become potential people. that reality to me was all abstract when they were in the freezer.\n\ntank failures at two clinics in ohio and california last year revealed hidden issues with long-frozen embryos, including some from the 1980s when ivf began. a few years ago, medical groups developed sample consent forms clinics could use for new patients, spelling out what could happen to unused embryos. but that hasn't resolved what to do with ones made long ago.\n\nanti-vaxxers among top 'threats to global health,' who says\n\nit's a real dilemma for these clinics, said rich vaughn, a los angeles lawyer who headed the american bar association's assisted reproduction committee for many years. we don't quite know what to do with them and everyone's afraid to act for fear they'll be sued if people surface decades later and want their embryos.\n\nthe number is growing as more couples try ivf and because of changes in how it's done. the old way was to mix eggs and sperm in the lab and transfer multiple fresh embryos to a womb, hoping at least one would lead to pregnancy. now, couples usually freeze many embryos, test for health problems and transfer the most viable one at a time to avoid multiple births. that often means leftovers once the desired family is complete.\n\nhow many embryos are in storage isn't known — centers don't have to report that. one study estimated there were 1.4 million in the u.s. researchers think 5 to 7 percent are abandoned, though it's as high as 18 percent at some clinics. some define that as a year of no contact or storage payments after reasonable efforts to find the owners; others draw the line at five years. some clinics search social media and hire investigators to find owners when abandonment is suspected.\n\nit has vexed our field from the start, said dr. mark sauer, a fertility specialist at rutgers robert wood johnson medical school who is on the ethics committee of the american society of reproductive medicine.\n\nit also has vexed couples, many of whom never expected so many leftovers. sara raber of new york's long island had five extras after conceiving two children.\n\nbaby born 3 years ago has gone home from hospital at last\n\nyour goal in the beginning is just to get pregnant, so making a lot of embryos seems necessary because you don't know how many tries it will take, she said. but disposing of extras brings a finality to family building that's different for ivf couples than it is for those who conceived naturally.\n\nyou're making a conscious decision not to have a baby anymore, said her husband, howard raber. that's what makes it hard.\n\neven after the rabers agreed to donate theirs to research, which usually means to a fertility clinic to let staff practice ivf, the paperwork sat on her desk for months, sarah raber said.\n\nin arlington, virginia, sammis is having a similar struggle. i get to the point of signing the papers and i just can't deal with it, she said.\n\nsammis said a friend who couldn't decide what to do with her embryos moved away and didn't give the fertility center her forwarding address ... that was her way of dealing with it.\n\nwhen couples have abandoned embryos, it was largely because they did not want to be responsible for making a very difficult decision. they would rather let the program do it, sauer said.\n\ncolorado reports state's first pediatric flu death of season\n\nandrea braverman, a health psychologist at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia, said it's not an easy choice. a study of 131 couples in canada found that one third had not returned for frozen embryos after five years. another study found that up to 70 percent of couples delayed a decision for at least five years and many changed their minds about what they thought they'd do after they had ivf.\n\nthis is a fluid decision. it is not a one-and-done, braverman said.\n\ndr. craig sweet, who runs a fertility clinic in fort myers, florida, knows the problem well. about 18 percent, or 300, of his clinic's frozen embryos are abandoned, some for 25 years. a study he did found that couples were more likely to abandon embryos if they had stored them a long time, had a low education level, already had many children or owed the clinic money.\n\none of his patients with more than a dozen leftover embryos forged her husband's signature on forms giving permission to use them because she wanted more children and he did not. the plan fell apart when the clinic insisted on seeing him personally.\n\nthings happen. life happens, divorce happens, depression, financial changes — many things can lead a couple to disagree about using embryos, sweet said.\n\nthe courts view an embryo as something between person and property, said susan crockin, a reproductive law expert at georgetown university. when it's in the lab as opposed to being in a womb, people have equal rights to it and most courts will not allow one member of a couple to use an embryo over the other's objection, she said.\n\nthe actress sofia vergara and her ex-fiancé nick loeb fought over frozen embryos they made, but a court said vergara could not be forced to procreate against her wish and denied loeb use of the embryos after the couple split.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nstates may try to rewrite legal precedents. last april, arizona's governor signed legislation allowing one member of a divorced couple to use embryos created during a marriage even if the ex-spouse doesn't want a child.\n\nclinics try to avoid being in the middle.\n\nwhat we tell couples is that if you're divorced, nobody gets to transfer the embryos until we get something from a court that says who has control of them, said dr. richard t. scott jr., scientific director of reproductive medicine associates, one of the nation's largest clinics with centers in new jersey, pennsylvania and florida.\n\nin 2005, sweet began requiring patients to agree not to destroy unused embryos. he also started embryo donation international to provide embryos to couples willing to use them to have children. he accepts embryos from 62 facilities in north america and has more than 400 available; 50 to 60 were used in 2017, he said.\n\nit just didn't make sense to us that people were discarding perfectly normal, useful embryos, he said.\n\nhis ivf coordinator, rebecca ruano, had 18 leftover embryos after the birth of her twins, and agreed to donate the extras to people unable to have children. i was not willing to destroy or donate them to science. we worked too hard for them, she said.\n\nfrozen embryos remain viable for decades as far as anyone knows. last year, the national embryo donation center in tennessee reported a birth using an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nsweet supplied a chicago woman an embryo that had been frozen for 17 years and made one request:\n\nwhen the baby is born, he said, i want you to see if you can register the kid to vote.

the u.s. conference of catholic bishops (usccb) issued a stark condemnation of president biden's abortion agenda on the day of his inauguration, arguing that he would advance moral evil on the preeminent priority for the faithful.\n\ni must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, said los angeles archbishop jose gomez, who serves as the usccb's president. of deep concern is the liberty of the church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.\n\nhis comments came amid a broader debate about u.s. politicians, like house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., who identify as catholic but pursue policies that conflict with church teaching. biden, during the campaign, reversed his decades-old position on the hyde amendment, which blocks most taxpayer funding for abortions. he's also pledged to codify roe v. wade, a move that conservatives say would allow abortion up till the moment of birth.\n\nsome roman catholics sounding alarm about biden administration, conflicts with moral teaching\n\nprior to biden's inauguration, he and pelosi attended a mass held at st. matthew's cathedral in washington, d.c. it's unclear whether they took communion but archbishop wilton gregory said beforehand that he wouldn't deny biden the sacrament.\n\nduring the campaign, then-candidate biden was denied communion by a south carolina priest and in august, cardinal raymond burke, the former head of the archdiocese of st. louis, said the former vice president shouldn't receive communion and wasn't a catholic in good standing.\n\nfor years, biden supported the hyde amendment with the rationale that religious americans shouldn't have to pay for procedures they fundamentally oppose. he similarly argued that americans shouldn't be forced to embrace his faith's view of abortion. he appeared to personally flout church teaching, however, when he officiated a same-sex wedding ceremony in 2016. he also picked a health and human services secretary who previously sued nuns for opposing obamacare's contraception mandate.\n\nregardless, gomez welcomed biden and said it would be refreshing to engage with a president who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions.\n\ngomez added in wednesday's statement that abortion is not only a private matter, it raises troubling and fundamental questions of fraternity, solidarity, and inclusion in the human community. it is also a matter of social justice. we cannot ignore the reality that abortion rates are much higher among the poor and minorities, and that the procedure is regularly used to eliminate children who would be born with disabilities.\n\nbiden launches ads touting his faith after cardinal says he's 'not a catholic in good standing'\n\nboth the catholic catechism and some clergy have indicated that politicians have an obligation to support anti-abortion legislation. the section of the catechism discussing abortion says that the procedure and infanticide are abominable crimes.\n\nafter gomez's statement, chicago cardinal blase cupich called it ill-considered, alleging that bishops only received it hours before it was released and was crafted without involvement from the body's administrative committee.\n\nthe internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and i look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the gospel, we can build up the unity of the church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis, cupich said.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\npope francis, meanwhile, called on biden to work towards a society that respected every human's rights.\n\nat a time when the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses, he said, i pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice.

kirk douglas, one of the most famous american leading men of the mid-20th century remembered for his dimpled chin, chiseled features, and virile hollywood roles, died wednesday at the age of 103, his family announced.\n\nit is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and i announce that kirk douglas left us today at the age of 103, kirk's son, michael douglas, wrote in a statement shared to social media.\n\nhe continued: to the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\nbut to me and my brothers joel and peter he was simply dad, to catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife anne, a wonderful husband, he added.\n\nmichael concluded his post by writing: kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet.let me end with the words i told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. dad- i love you so much and i am so proud to be your son.\n\nthe statement did not indicate exactly how or where he died.\n\nkirk douglas says wife anne saved his life twice\n\nthe 75-year-old actor also shared photos of his late father which included several sweet family photos.\n\na world war ii veteran who survived a helicopter crash, a stroke, and two knee replacements, douglas literally rose from rags to riches -- his father was a ragman -- and starred in over 80 films, including, perhaps most famously, spartacus. he remained in the public spotlight well into his old age, if not as an actor then as a producer, author, and blogger.\n\ndouglas was born issur izzy danielovitch on dec. 9, 1916, to russian jewish parents in amsterdam, new york.\n\n\n\nhis family was poor, and he claimed to have worked more than 40 jobs -- including stints as a professional wrestler, a waiter, and a janitor -- before becoming an actor.\n\nmichael douglas reveals plans for dad kirk douglas' 103rd birthday\n\n\n\nloans, scholarships, and sweet-talking propelled the aspiring performer through st. lawrence university and, eventually, the american academy of dramatic arts in new york city, where he studied alongside lauren bacall and his future wife diana dill, who would give birth to his first and most famous son, michael, in 1944.\n\n\n\nafter two small roles on broadway under his new stage name, kirk douglas, and a few years in the navy during world war ii, he made his on-screen debut with a part in 1946's the strange love of martha ivers at age 30.\n\nkirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come — michael douglas\n\n\n\nhowever, his big break came in 1949 when he starred as an ambitious boxer in the film noir classic champion, which earned him his first of three oscar nominations for best actor.\n\n\n\nthe role cemented douglas' steely image, and with his distinctive raspy voice and piercing eyes he continued to take on intense, often cocky, characters in his films. he was once quoted as saying i've made a career of playing sons of b---hes.\n\ncatherine zeta-jones gushes over kirk douglas\n\n\n\nhe played a ruthless hollywood producer in the bad and beautiful (1952) and portrayed vincent van gogh in lust for life (1956).\n\nthrough his own company, bryna productions -- named for his mother -- douglas also produced and starred in the kubrick-directed paths of glory (1957) and, more famously, in spartacus (1960).\n\ndouglas' decision to give screen credit to spartacus' blacklisted screenwriter dalton trumbo -- one of the hollywood ten who testified before the house un-american activities committee in 1947 -- helped bring an end to entertainment industry mccarthyism.\n\nafter a divorce from his first wife in 1951, douglas eloped with german-born publicist anne buydens in 1954, and despite affairs with fellow stars joan crawford, marlene dietrich and pier angeli, among others, he retained a reputation as a family man, increasingly devoted to his wife as he grew old.\n\nof the secret to his long-lasting marriage, douglas told fox news in 2017: [date night is] the same as it's been throughout our marriage. we spend what we call the 'golden hour' together at around 6:30 each night. we'll sit and talk and laugh and share our day and our thoughts with each other.\n\nas his film career waned in the 1980s -- and his son's career took off -- douglas focused on philanthropy, charity work, and his role as goodwill ambassador for the us state department, a post he has held since 1963.\n\n\n\nhe received the presidential medal of freedom in 1981, the jefferson award for public service in 1983, and the french legion of honor in 1985.\n\n\n\nthough he never actually won an academy award, douglas was granted an honorary oscar in 1996 for 50 years as a creative and moral force in the motion picture community.\n\ndouglas wrote three novels and several memoirs about his career, his newfound spirituality -- he embraced judaism, the faith in which he was raised, after surviving a helicopter crash that killed two others in 1991 -- and his struggle with depression and regaining his speech after suffering a stroke in 1996.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\n\n\nin 2003, douglas finally starred alongside his son michael, as well as his first wife and grandson cameron, in it runs in the family, a movie about a dysfunctional multi-generation family trying to reconcile their differences. it earned disappointing box office figures and cool reviews.\n\nhe fared much better with critics at age 92, when he delivered sold-out performances of his one-man show, before i forget, presenting anecdotes about living through hollywood's golden age and self-deprecating meditations on his achievements.\n\n\n\nhe is survived by his wife of 65 years (married may 29, 1954) anne buydens, their son peter douglas, two sons from his first marriage -- michael and joel douglas -- and seven grandchildren.

as a journalist, falling in love with a person you are covering is about as taboo as it gets. add in the fact that the subject of such affection is a person who once earned the title the most hated man in america, and you've got one big story to either share or conceal. as former bloomberg journalist christie smythe tells me, it is in fact, a crazy story.\n\ni sat down with smythe for her first tv interview since revealing her love affair with martin shkreli in a tell-all article published in elle magazine in december. shkreli is best known as pharma-bro, the former drug company ceo who is currently serving seven years in the low-security allenwood low federal correctional institution in pennsylvania for two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy.\n\nshkreli earned the nickname after raising the price of the life-saving hiv drug daraprim by 5,000% overnight, sparking outrage and earning him the moniker for what was called his callous nature in making the dramatic price increase.\n\nreporter quits job, leaves husband after falling for jailed 'pharma bro' martin shkreli\n\nsmythe describes her budding relationship with shkreli as something unimaginable at first saying, i mean, from where i started and where i ended up, it's like no one would believe that. if you wrote fiction about it, no one would believe it. but, i've been a journalist for 15 years. i've covered business and legal issues mostly. i graduated from the university of missouri. i did a fellowship at columbia. you know, i have a solid journalism education. i got into covering courts after moving to new york in 2008.\n\nsmythe began covering brooklyn federal court for bloomberg news in 2012, which is how she ended up reporting on shkreli. she says, he was the villain everybody hated. so, of course, when he was arrested for securities fraud charges, massive story. my biggest story ever. that was how i got into the story. like that was my first introduction to him.\n\nshkreli gave tabloid writers and business reporters plenty of fodder through the course of his trial, creating headlines as he rolled his eyes through testimony, and live-streamed at home after court, drinking the occasional beer.\n\nsmythe was one of the reporters who broke the story of shkreli's arrest in 2015. she says that over time the two fell in love and that shkreli is simply misunderstood, saying, he's just a very, very eccentric person. it doesn't play well in public, especially in negative light. he is phenomenally intelligent and charismatic, but also has no emotional intelligence and very little common sense and is very awkward. and if you combine all of those things, you get kind of this public relations disaster.\n\ntrump signs executive order to lower drug prices in fight against big pharma\n\nsmythe says her marriage was already having difficulties and her attention to shkreli only made things worse. but, she says, she didn't cross the line when it came to covering him.\n\nher former employer disagrees. in a statement, a bloomberg news spokesperson said in part, ms. smythe's conduct with regard to mr. shkreli was not consistent with expectations for a bloomberg journalist. it became apparent that it would be best to part ways. ms. smythe tendered her resignation, and we accepted it.\n\nafter smythe left her job she says that's when things between the two heated up, and her marriage cooled off, telling me, after i left my job at bloomberg and i was kind of on the way out with my husband, with my ex-husband, we were planning to split up. i visited martin in prison and i just simply told him that i loved him.\n\ni asked smythe if there was any sort of soft launch into the romantic conversation, to which she replied, no, once you're in, you're in. smythe says that's when shkreli told her that he loved her, too.\n\nthere is only one photo of the two together, taken during a visitation day inside the prison. smythe says that over the course of his imprisonment the two have shared letters, spoken on the phone, exchanged emails and even talked about having a life together once he is released from custody. smythe added that shkreli also told her he wanted to have children with her, too. she told me, we talked about me freezing my eggs and after he suggested that that could be a possibility, i said, 'ok, sure, i'll go ahead and try, i'll look into it and see about that' and i did it and i'm really glad i did it. i mean, if things work out with martin, great. if they don't, i feel like i've preserved that option for myself.\n\n'pharma bro' martin shkreli denied prison release to research coronavirus cure\n\ni asked smythe what she has to say to people who have told her she's been brainwashed and that shkreli is using and manipulating her. she said she would tell them, you don't know what you're talking about, you don't know me and what an incredibly willful and independent person i have been since childhood. and you don't know martin. martin is not a brilliant manipulator when you get to know him.\n\nsmythe says she's also had to confront criticism about how shkreli treated other female journalists, even calling him out for some of the comments he made online and says she doesn't support any form of harassment but says she believed shkreli saw some of his comments as justified responses.\n\naccording to smythe, the relationship hit a snag after covid hit and the elle article was published. she says their relationship started to break down and the two stopped speaking. as of this writing, smythe says they are back on speaking terms and have been corresponding through emails and phone calls.\n\nas for what's next, she says they are figuring things out.\n\ni would love martin to get out, she said. i would love him to start working on something productive that helps the world. and i'd like to play some sort of role in helping him get there. that's my dream.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\njust this week, a federal judge denied shkreli's second request for an early release, rejecting his claims that the prison's lockdown due to covid-19 has put a strain on his mental health. in the 12-page ruling, the judge said shkreli didn't make an extraordinary and compelling reason to modify his sentence.\n\nso for now, smythe waits for shkreli's release. i asked her if she felt like she threw it all away in the end, as some of the post-elle magazine headlines have suggested. smythe told me, no, that was their interpretation. obviously, they wanted to heighten the drama and the contrast of where my life was before and where it is now. so i understand those choices. but no, i didn't throw anything away. i chose a different path. and it wasn't for martin specifically. martin definitely was a catalyst, but helped kind of propel me in that direction. but, you know, i chose freedom, essentially.

in her ingraham angle monologue on monday, host laura ingraham said democrats are misuing american servicemembers for political theater just months after they roundly condemned donald trump for considering deploying national guardsmen to quell left-wing riots in major cities across the country.\n\ningraham played a montage of top democrats, including former san antonio mayor julian castro and sens. kirsten gillibrand of new york and richard blumenthal of connecticut claiming at the time that trump was misusing military and government assets for his own advantages.\n\nfast-forwarding to present day, ingraham pointed to how district of columbia mayor muriel bowser will hold national guard troops in washington until at least march.\n\nthousands of troops were called to action in town earlier this month in advent of president biden's inauguration.\n\nthose democrats have had a change of heart, she said, adding that bowser's plan calls for 5,000 guardsmen to stay in the district -- down from about 25,000 called upon following capitol unrest and ahead of biden's ceremony.\n\ndid they really think that insane animal skin guy was planning to return to d.c. with other furry friends to make a stand? she said, referring to now-indicted q-anon shaman jacob jake angeli chansley of arizona.\n\nthis is political theater directed by democrat leadership. they are using the military to ratchet up the drama of their kangaroo impeachment trial of former president trump, the host said.\n\nit allows them to play the victim despite evidence of any serious on-going threat. it furnishes them with a back door way to execute their next agenda item: purging the military of any political opponents.\n\ningraham went on to explain that, according to the hill, democrats seek to use the national defense authorization act (ndaa) to address purported extremism within the pentagon and related agencies.\n\nthe broader and more opaque the language, the easier it is to cancel military members and other government personnel who don't call in line politically or even culturally, she said.\n\nmost people would agree that generally dangerous extremists should not be allowed to serve and join the military. we don't want members of isis in our ranks and obviously kkk, of course not. that's not who the democrats are talking about.\n\ningraham went on to point out a recent comment from white house press secretary jennifer psaki, who said biden ordered the office of the director of national intelligence to execute a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the fbi and dhs on domestic violent extremists.\n\nthis assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations, said psaki.\n\ningraham warned that it is worth considering what ngos psaki is referring to.\n\nwhat non-governmental organizations is she talking about that will report on their fellow americans? the aclu, black lives matter, planned parenthood? anti-gun rights organizations?\n\npresumably, they think anyone who disagrees with their far-left goals are extremists. from what we have already heard the biden administration say, it's clear that they are going to use the power and surveillance of the u.s. government to keep tabs on a lot more people than we ever would have thought would have been embedded in government agencies as domestic terrorists.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nyes, law-abiding americans whom the party in power think are getting out of the line.\n\nwhat if someone complains on facebook that the federal government wastes money or says roe v. wade should be overturned. or what if they are conservative baptists and believe sex outside of marriage is immoral? will they now be considered extremists or even terrorists? we deserve to know, she continued.\n\nyou see where this is destined to lead. it is not to a freer and more united america.

farrah fawcett was destined to be a star.\n\nthe future charlie's angels icon was in her freshman year studying microbiology when she was named one of the 10 most beautiful coeds on the university of texas campus. it was 1968.\n\nfarrah fawcett maintained close bonds with family, friends after becoming famous\n\nas a result, her photos were sent to various agencies in hollywood before it caught the eye of agent david mirisch. he took two years trying to convince a young fawcett to leave behind texas for hollywood. by junior year, she finally agreed.\n\ncloser weekly reported she was quickly signed by screen gems to a contract that paid her $350 a week.\n\nher father was shocked, wondering what she was doing to make so much money a week, mike pingel, fawcett's former assistant who currently runs charliesangels.com, told closer weekly. … fans have told me when they saw her in those commercials, they were like, 'who is that girl?' she just had the 'it' girl look.\n\nfawcett was soon in demand for tv guest roles for shows such as i dream of jeannie, myra breckinridge and the flying nun, just to name a few. but it was a poster that would forever change her life.\n\n'charlie's angels' star jaclyn smith reflects on battling breast cancer\n\naccording to the publication, fawcett was approached in 1976 by pro-arts, inc. to become their newest pinup. fawcett agreed and 40 rolls of film were shot by photographer bruce mcbroom, the choice coming down to the famous one of her in the one-piece red swimsuit. that image reportedly remains the best-selling poster in history. the sultry image is currently enshrined at the smithsonian.\n\nthe combination of that poster with 'charlie's angels' was a phenomenon that was hard to escape, said pingel. something like 12 million boys plus had that poster on their walls, so it's hard to avoid the big smile, big hair and that bathing suit.\n\nit was also that same year when jill munroe came calling.\n\ncloser weekly noted that fawcett and then-husband, the six million dollar man star lee majors, often played tennis with producer aaron spelling, which led to her being cast as the heavenly blonde bombshell in the 1976 movie charlie's angels, which spawned the series that ran from that same year until 1981.\n\ncheryl ladd explains why she nearly turned down role\n\ncharlie's angels was based on a wealthy mystery man named charlie who ran a detective agency featuring three beautiful women (fawcett, kate jackson and jaclyn smith). it was an immediate hit.\n\n… these three women were not only breaking the ceiling of being three leads on their own show, but they were number one in the ratings, pingel explained. it was just lightning in a bottle. … the funny thing is that many of them told me that they were working so hard all the time, they had no time to really understand what was going on until they had a break. then they would go out in public and be mobbed. and they all had stalkers; people were trying to break into their homes. [co-star] cheryl ladd said, 'one day i was nobody and the next day everything i ate was something interesting to someone.\n\nbut despite the show's success, fawcett was ready to spread her wings even further. the guardian reported that after season 1, she left.\n\nat that point, i think she was like, 'i'm pretty good at doing something like this,' said pingel. farrah was wanting to expand her acting. the progression came and at the end of the first season, she wanted more as an actress. people are going to hate me for saying this, but she was done with the 'cookie-cutter' jill munroe, the beautiful girl that episode after episode did the same thing.\n\npingel added fawcett also knew her worth.\n\nsuzanne somers talks 'three's company' firing\n\neven in '77 she knew the power of her imagery and what money can come with that, and what she's worth as far as that's concerned, he explained. they were only offering her 2.5 percent of the merchandise. at that point, she already had her own poster coming out; she knew she wanted much more than that for her image and her rights. and that's why she didn't sign the contract. she kept saying to them, 'can we renegotiate this?'\n\ncloser weekly noted fawcett was allowed to leave the show but was contractually obliged to make guest appearances six times, which she did. ladd, who played munroe's sister kris, would go on to replace her.\n\nnot only did fawcett stayed busy professionally, but she was also focusing on her personal life. her marriage to majors lasted from 1973 until 1982. and while her relationship with actor ryan o'neal was on again/off again for a number of years, they welcomed a son, redmond james fawcett-o'neal, in 1985. fawcett and o'neal remained together in the last decade of the star's life.\n\npingel said he had zero regrets working alongside the star.\n\nwhen i was being asked to even interview for the job, i was like, 'i don't really want this job, because i don't want farrah fawcett to be yelling at me at some point,' he admitted. and at some point that is gonna happen, because you're an assistant. but honestly, we had such a great rapport in our working relationship. … she was just a down home country girl. very sweet, but the smartest businesswoman i've ever met. she knew the value of her and she wasn't going to take anything less than what she valued herself for.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nfawcett passed away in 2009 at age 62 from anal cancer. pingel said it's still difficult to think about his former boss all these years later.\n\nit's tough for all of us who were very close to her, he explained. because she had such a way about her. such sweetness and just a genuine, amazing person. she's gone way too soon; she had so much more to offer… it's been 10 years this summer, and it's still hard to even wrap my head around the fact that she's no longer her. i know that's a weird thing to say. believe it or not, i'll be in a store and i'll see something and still be like, 'oh, farrah would love that. i should call her.'\n\nshe was a boss. she was a friend. she was an angel, added pingel.\n\nbut fawcett's legacy lives on. closer weekly noted the farrah fawcett foundation was designed to help with patient care and financial assistance for those battling cancer.\n\nback in april 2018, jaclyn smith told fox news she still cherishes fond memories from her times on charlie's angels.\n\nwe had laughs, we had so many laughs, said the now-73-year-old. angels in chains, being chained together. eating lunch together. it was an education and it was eye-opening because each girl was so unique with her own personality and style. and these are my friends today. that bond is what i really remember.\n\nthe friendship is what i treasure from that. the friendship. aaron spelling was so dear to me. he's somebody i miss. he was a personal friend, as well as the producer of that show and the creator. we've lost some people. john forsythe, what a gentleman. david doyle. and of course farrah [fawcett]. it's bittersweet to think back.

the marriage of britain's queen elizabeth ii and prince philip has lasted for over 70 years — yet it hasn't escaped rumors of alleged affairs.\n\nbritish author ingrid seward, who is also editor-in-chief of majesty magazine, has been covering the royals since the 1980s and has written over 20 books on the subject. her latest one, my husband and i: the inside story of 70 years of royal marriage, analyzes the lasting union between elizabeth, 92 and philip, 97.\n\nin the book, seward investigates allegations of philip's affairs that have lingered for decades. as previously reported by town & country, the duke of edinburgh has been linked to numerous women, most notably pat kirkwood in the '30s and '40s, a stage actress whose legs were coined the eighth wonder of the world.\n\nphilip and kirkwood reportedly met on seven different occasions, the first of which philip went to her dressing room before a performance in london in 1948. that initial meeting purportedly led to dinner and dancing until dawn. elizabeth, who was then a princess, was eight months pregnant with prince charles at the time.\n\naccording to the u.k.'s mirror, kirkwood denied claims of any illicit relationship with prince phillip until her death in 2007 at age 86.\n\nin my research, i never got a conclusive answer, seward told fox news about all the rumors. there's so much gossip about philip and his affairs, but all the women that deny it, that have been picked out of possibilities of having affairs — well, most of them are dead now. … and philip himself obviously denies it.\n\nin 2012, the telegraph reported royal biographer and historian michael thornton had custody of the letters between philip and kirkwood. thornton claimed he wasn't allowed, by the terms of kirkwood's will, to show the letters to anyone except the person who will be chosen as philip's official biographer after his death.\n\nhowever, the publication noted nothing in the letters confirmed anything improper occurred between the prince and the showgirl.\n\nthe telegraph added it was photographer baron nahum who introduced his pal philip to kirkwood at the london hippodrome, where she was headlining in the revue starlight roof. thornton claimed kirkwood was reportedly upset that philip never released an official denial of the affair to protect her reputation.\n\nkirkwood reportedly wrote to philip, … if there had been some support from your direction, the matter could have been squashed years ago, instead of (my) having to battle a sea of sharks single-handed.\n\nphilip replied, short of starting libel proceedings, there is absolutely nothing to be done. invasion of privacy, invention and false quotations are the bane of our existence.\n\nkirkwood reportedly went on to tell one journalist: a lady is not normally expected to defend her honor. it is the gentleman who should do that. i would have had a happier and easier life if prince philip, instead of coming uninvited to my dressing room, had gone home to his pregnant wife on the night in question.\n\nin addition to kirkwood, philip has also been linked to other actresses, including helene cordet, merle oberon and anna massey. people magazine previously reported rumors persisted that philip was actually the father — not the godfather — of cordet's two children. she called the paternity gossip ridiculous and claimed they were fathered by french fighter pilot marcel boisot.\n\nno one is saying anything [about these stories] and probably won't until after the queen dies, said seward. no one will say anything because anything would be very hurtful to her if indeed they were true. but, there are lots of stories. you can't ignore it.\n\nin 2017, netflix's the crown implied philip may have had an affair with russian ballerina galina ulanova in the 1950s. however, people noted there is no evidence that a relationship ever occurred.\n\npeople have often said, 'he must have been unfaithful,' but there is no solid evidence for that, said the show's historical consultant robert lacey to the publication. when you've seen the episodes, you get the feeling why people made that supposition. but there is no evidence for it.\n\nthere was one woman who rocked the royal household — and it wasn't an alleged mistress.\n\nseward revealed that despite tabloids claiming philip never welcomed his former daughter-in-law princess diana when she said i do to his son charles in 1981, the pair did connect before her seemingly fairytale marriage fell apart by rumors of his infidelity.\n\nhe did everything he could to help her, said seward. and he wrote these very charming letters saying, 'i too was an outsider and it's very difficult to marry into this family.' … but when the marriage started to fall apart, she became very difficult. and his tone got harsher. and at the end diana says… that she hated him.\n\nshe absolutely hated him. but to begin with they had a very good relationship. it just deteriorated as diana's marriage deteriorated. philip's reasoning for this was that her actions were derogatory to the monarchy. … [he felt] if people are reading all these stories, they will lose respect for the royal family and that's what worried him. and sadly, by the end, she wasn't on speaking terms with him.\n\ndiana and charles officially divorced in 1996. in 1997, diana passed away at age 36 after suffering from injuries she sustained in a paris car crash.\n\ndespite all the gossip and scandals elizabeth and philip had to face over the years, their bond endured.\n\nit's quite extraordinary really, said seward. … in those days, it wasn't quite so unusual to have a young girl fall in love with someone and stay in love with them. but she never really looked at anyone else once she met him. he was just gorgeous. he was so handsome, tall, blonde and very funny. and you know, women love funny men.\n\n… i think women just adored him because he was such a handsome specimen. … and he has an amazing charm when he wants to use it, an amazing charm. he's a very interesting character. … whatever he may have done in his private life, no one has really put their finger on that. he's always put his duty to the queen first.

the following is a look at the faith of the top 2020 democratic presidential candidates:\n\npete buttigieg: episcopalian\n\nformer mayor of south bend, ind., pete buttigieg was baptized catholic but says he did not consider participating in the church because he is gay. he eventually settled on the episcopal church, the american branch of anglicanism and a progressive branch, which voted to allow same-sex marriages.\n\ni was reluctant to talk about (religion) for a long time, buttigieg told cnn. but after he married his husband, chasten glezman, at the cathedral of st. james, and declared his candidacy, he has pointed to his faith on the campaign trail.\n\nhe questioned whether president trump believes in god, called vice president mike pence a cheerleader for the porn-star presidency, and condemned conservative christians as moral hypocrites for supporting the trump administration.\n\namy klobuchar: congregationalist\n\nminnesota sen. amy klobuchar said she is a congregationalist, a member of the united church of christ, and her husband is catholic.\n\nfaith is very important to me, it helped me get through my dad's addiction. i think everyone should be able to practice whatever religion they want in this country, klobuchar said during a cnn town hall. that's the united states of america. or not practice religion. but for me that's a very important part of my life.\n\nbernie sanders: jewish\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders told the new york times he is proud to be jewish but is not actively involved in organized religion.\n\ni am jewish, sanders told the times' editorial board when asked whether he believes in god. i am proud to be jewish. i was bar mitzvahed from the kings highway jewish center, a long time ago. i am not actively involved in organized religion.\n\nsanders says he believes in god and freedom of religion in contrast to president trump, whom he says practices discrimination by restricting immigration from a number of muslim-majority countries.\n\njoe biden: roman catholic\n\nformer vice president joe biden has not been shy about his roman catholic faith, with which he has always identified.\n\ni find great solace in my faith, biden told npr in 2017. i happen to be a roman catholic, a practicing catholic … i found that, for me, the externalities of my faith bring me a sense of peace. … my son died, and he had this set of rosaries on and i've been wearing it since and i will wear it till i die. … i'm not saying when i pray the rosary god's gonna help me — it's just solace.\n\nthe former senator was denied communion at

life, his advisers and other observers say. he believes in god, but is more likely to be found at church for a political event than temple for worship. he grew up among very few jews in medford, massachusetts, but his family maintained some traditions, such as a kosher kitchen and hebrew school.\n\na member of the temple emanu-el, the upper east side reform synagogue, bloomberg didn't raise

practices.\n\ngabbard, the first female combat veteran to run for president, said her faith was put to the test while she served in iraq. she married her husband, abraham williams, in 2015 in a traditional vedic wedding ceremony.
last month, chinese leader xi jinping reportedly made china's wealthiest man jack ma disappear. here at home, twitter ceo jack dorsey made the president of the united states disappear. both of these moves were shows of strength. and the parallels between them should shake every american to their core.\n\nsilicon valley tech giants like twitter and facebook are now, undisputedly, the most powerful companies in the history of the world. the dutch east india company wielded a private militia, but it still couldn't control what people said and read.\n\nas of today, president trump will have access to neither the nuclear codes nor a twitter account. but our new class of unelected corporate monarchs now controls whether and how americans can hear any democratically elected president in the future.\n\njudge andrew p. napolitano: free speech, the first amendment and our modern tech-filled world\n\nthis is the power of the 21st-century leviathan, far more insidious than anything thomas hobbes imagined. it's the unholy marriage between big government and big business, through which corporations operate as the extended tentacles of the state.\n\nit's the birth of woke capitalism – a toxic new brew of profit-seeking and wokeism. it's a cultural revolution perpetuated not just by politicians, but by the leaders of big corporations – especially in silicon valley.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\ndon't private companies get to decide who uses their platforms? yes – if they're actually behaving as private companies. but in reality, today's corporate behemoths in silicon valley are effectively doing the work of big government under the cloak of private enterprise to evade constitutional constraints. here's how the game works.\n\nfirst, congress endowed big tech with the special corporate privilege of section 230 of the communications decency act that immunizes technology companies from any liability in state court for censoring or otherwise regulating user content.\n\nsecond, liberal congressmen threatened those same companies at hearings for the last year saying that if they fail to remove hate speech from white nationalists, they would be punished.\n\nthird, liberal lawmakers congratulated social media companies after they go on to censor content that democrats don't like.\n\nfourth, tech titans took their most aggressive actions of all just as democrats are poised to have control of the white house, the senate and the house of representatives for the first time in over a decade.\n\nand fifth – of course – silicon valley billionaires made staggeringly one-sided campaign contributions to those same democratic candidates as a show of good faith, and to remind them where their bread is buttered.\n\nin 2020, keeping money out of politics ceased to be a liberal mantra. instead, blending profits with politics became the new progressive way. consequently, we have devolved from a three-branch federal government to one with a headquarters in silicon valley and a branch office in washington d.c., and with no pesky constitutional term limits for jack dorsey and facebook ceo mark zuckerberg.\n\nhopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every american.\n\nthe great challenge for today's conservative movement isn't to simply dismantle big government. it's to dismantle the powerful henchmen of big government in the private sector. they can fire you, tarnish your reputation, excise you from the internet and cancel your identity. you can either speak your mind freely or enjoy the comforts of modern life. but you can no longer safely do both.\n\nconservative solutions must be prudent, not merely reactionary. enacting regulations out of spite will only favor big business leaders who deftly capture the regulatory process. likewise, repealing section 230 would be a boon to big tech in the long run. the statute was a bad mistake but repealing it now would simply empower silicon valley's titans against smaller startups since larger companies can better withstand legal liability.\n\ninstead, the right first step is to work through the last institutional bastion that we can trust – our court system – to recognize that state action dressed up as private business is still state action. the first amendment applies to big tech censorship, a view supported by certain supreme court precedents.\n\nhopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every american – in their places of work and their sites of worship, at the dinner table and on the internet.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nno doubt this will be difficult for both populist conservatives and classical free-market conservatives to swallow. but to borrow from dorothy in the wizard of oz, we're not in 1980 anymore. the problem isn't just big government; it's the woke-industrial complex. defeating that monster should be the defining challenge of the new conservative movement.\n\nif we succeed, the prize is worth winning: a revival of true democracy and true capitalism in america. to save both, we need to disentangle each from the other. the leaders who help the republican party understand this new reality will hold the keys to the gop's future – and more importantly, our country's future as well.\n\nclick here for more from vivek ramaswamy

people often ask what the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. would say today. no need to second guess. injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nsurely, the violence at the u.s. capitol would have broken his heart, as would the partisan witch hunts that seem to multiply daily.\n\nwe adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself, he once said. we will try to persuade with our words, but if our words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts.\n\nremembering martin luther king jr.\n\nmy earliest memory of my uncle was his marriage to coretta. i was the flower girl at the wedding, which took place on the lawn of my aunt's parent's house in marion, ala., in june 1953. i was almost 3 years old. my early memories were just like snapshots, yet i knew even then that i was a member of a family whose faith in god was the driving force.\n\nmy granddaddy, rev. martin luther king sr., and my grandmother, alberta williams king, instilled in their three children, christine, martin and alfred, that the king family legacy is one established by god, in faith, hope and love. it was that faith, that deep and consequential love of god, that brought my family to a level of leadership of the 20th-century civil rights movement.\n\nnonviolence is absolute commitment to the way of love. love is not emotional bash; it is not empty sentimentalism, uncle ml said. it is the active outpouring of one's whole being into the being of another.\n\nwe were also taught that forgiveness must be bestowed willingly, freely and without conditions. those were lessons we fell back on many times as we were called on to forgive, publicly and sincerely, the most heinous of crimes.\n\nit's true we lived in the spotlight, and many of the civil rights leaders passed through our homes on a regular basis during their journey. yet, in many ways, we were just a normal family. my daddy, rev. a.d. king, would wrestle with his older brother, uncle ml, while the family chuckled in the background. they were playful and joyful and growing up around them was a lot of fun.\n\ni have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nwhen uncle ml was assassinated in 1968, i was 17 years old and in the restive way of teenagers, i wanted to blame all white people. i wanted to give hate room to grow in my heart. but my mother and father and my grandparents and uncle ml reminded all of us that hate only begets more hate, and there should not be room in the world for animosity or mistrust or hostility.\n\nwhen my uncle was killed on april 4, 1968, i remember talking to my daddy about my feelings of hating white people. daddy rocked me in his arms and said to me, white people march with us, they go to jail with us, they pray with us, they live with us, and they die with us. white people didn't kill your uncle, the devil did.\n\nthe next year i was called to forgive again – not only those still-unknown people who had killed my uncle, but now they had killed my father. i had to forgive yet another injustice; including all those that had shrugged off my daddy's death and called it a suicide.\n\nduring this time from 1968 to 1974, much was happening in my life. i became engaged to be married in 1968, a bride in 1969, and a mother in 1970. still reeling from the brutal deaths of my daddy and uncle i experienced two abortions and a miscarriage. then on june 30, 1974, my beloved grandmother alberta king was murdered while playing the lord's prayer on the organ during sunday services at historic ebenezer baptist church in atlanta.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nback then i didn't think my broken heart was big enough to forgive and to go on loving my fellow men and women. but love and forgiveness were the king family legacy, and while that legacy sometimes felt like a burden, i see now how it is a gift.\n\ni have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nthat's what he would tell us today, and what i say whenever i am given an opportunity. this year, as we observe mlk day, i urge everyone to remember that it is designated not as a day off from work, but as a day on of service. we can all find something constructive to do in our communities, even if it's just shaking the hand of the neighbor who supported a different candidate. anything we can do to increase the peace is more than worth our efforts.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nlove, my uncle ml said, is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.\n\nwhen we learn to value the human personality, and understand that we are one blood and one human race, we can learn to live together as brothers and sisters and we won't perish as fools.\n\nclick here for more from alveda king

bernie sanders is on a roll. after a strong showing in iowa and new hampshire, and berning through nevada, the socialist senator from vermont is without a doubt the democrat front-runner.\n\nodds-makers are giving bernie a 55 percent chance of becoming the democrat nominee.\n\nwhich raises a legitimate question: do democrats actually want to win the white house in november?\n\npaul batura: ronald reagan warned us about bernie sanders – over 40 years ago\n\ni ask because it is generally agreed that ousting president trump will require winning back those blue-collar workers in swing states who crossed party lines to vote republican in 2016. sanders is most definitely not the most likely candidate to do that.\n\nthere's a reason that left-wing commentator chris mathews compared sanders' win in nevada to france falling to the nazis in 1940. for democrats, it's almost that dire.\n\nbut really, bernie is not alone. no candidate seems to be tailoring his or her message to those traditional democrats who rejected hillary clinton.\n\nremember them?\n\nfolks: this is simple. there are a great many longtime democrats living in toss-up states who didn't like the direction that president obama took the country. those voters, many of them union members, decided to take a flyer on neophyte candidate donald trump. why? because he talked about things that mattered to them – like jobs and manufacturing and trade deals. he also appealed to their patriotism and common sense, like putting america first.\n\nin the end, better job opportunities and higher wages were more important to them than climate change or gender neutrality or a whole bunch of politically correct drivel that democrats want to ram down the country's throat.\n\nthese are people who love their country, and don't buy bernie sanders and joe biden's claim that it is essentially racist. these are people who go to church and abhor the democrats' enthusiasm for legalizing full-term abortion. these are people who work hard, pay their taxes, and believe others should do the same.\n\nthese are not nutty people; they are the backbone of our country. and right now, they are looking at sanders and the other candidates who want to represent the democratic party – the party of their parents and grandparents – and saying: these folks do not care about me.\n\nthey would be right.\n\nfrom the outset of the campaign, sanders and elizabeth warren jumped on medicare-for-all, dragging others along with them, convinced that health care was the issue that would topple republicans. ironically, they might have been right. the gop has made a total hash of overhauling obamacare and proposing a better alternative, in part thanks to the late sen. john mccain, who single-handedly undermined the party's health-care initiative.\n\nsanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.\n\nbut the approach taken by bernie and other progressives was so extreme – demanding the end of private insurance – that, rather than galvanizing support for democrats, it fractured the party. astonishingly, the candidates who jumped aboard single-payer health care never stopped to think about how their plan would impact union workers, who would be the group most opposed to ending private insurance.\n\nfor decades organized labor fought for the best insurance programs money could buy, and they got them. companies preferred giving out lavish health-care and pension benefits to increasing wages, which would have a more immediate impact on their bottom line.\n\nthese days, the costs of those health-care plans are enormous, and the coverage is excellent – far better than would be available under bernie's nationwide government-run system. union workers are not stupid; they know this would be a loss for them, and they will resist it.\n\nremember that obamacare was to be paid for in part by a 40 percent tax on so-called cadillac plans – the high-end plans that unions enjoy. that tax was delayed twice by congress and finally repealed, so intense was the opposition from big labor.\n\nthat resistance hasn't changed. sanders found that out when the culinary workers in nevada failed to endorse him, even as he was the obvious front-runner in their state.\n\nit isn't just on health care that democrats have gone off the reservation. consider the candidates – bernie among them – vowing to ban fracking, and promising the end of fossil fuels. are they not aware that in critical swing states like pennsylvania and ohio thousands of workers are making lots of money working in the oilfields? that those states have hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues courtesy of oil and petrochemical development?\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\nthese realities do not impress sanders. he has a fantastical vision of what the united states should look like. he wants to give everyone free health care and free college and, like the ideologue he is, doesn't know or care where the money will come from.\n\nsanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.\n\nhis approach to solving illegal immigration is to rebuild honduras, guatemala and el salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries. he is a co-sponsor of the green new deal, which is a fable that only an aging socialist could love. he vows to eliminate the profits in the health-care industry, but hasn't explained how companies will invest billions in new drugs if there is no reward for doing so.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nduring the campaign to date, the media has treated sanders as an entertaining oddity, and has rarely challenged him. count on that to change in coming months, as his rivals fight his ascent and president trump goes after him. film clips of sanders defending communist countries, or defending his campaign against sexism, will become more prevalent. he may still succeed in winning the nomination, but the bernie bubble will burst.\n\nvoters will inevitably come to see him for the demagogue that he is, and president trump will beat him in november.\n\nclick here to read more from liz peek
new york city mayor bill de blasio said that moderate democrats never learned the lessons of 2016, calling for the party to embrace a bold liberal agenda in the run-up to the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nde blasio, during an interview on sunday, suggested that moderate voices in the democratic party are holding their colleagues back.\n\ngrowing number of 2020 democrats supporting 'green new deal'\n\nthere is still a lot of moderate voices in the party that did not learn the lessons of 2016 and are not listening to what people need in this country, de blasio told cnn's jake tapper on state of the union. so i want to push this whole party, and i want to inform this debate in this country about the fact that we could go a lot further, we could be a lot bolder than what we're doing now.\n\nde blasio's comments come as democrats already have been trending further left in policy proposals and as recent polling suggests they're responding to the wishes of the democratic base.\n\naccording to a new gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. that was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscored a steady increase over the years. among americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by 9 points, although that is down from 19 points in gallup's first poll in 1992.\n\nthe study provided further evidence that the democratic party is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate—particularly on health care, economics, and immigration.\n\nmost democrats identify as liberals for first time, underscoring leftward tilt of party\n\nlast week, de blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city – including illegal immigrants.\n\nbill de blasio announces guaranteed health care for all new yorkers, including illegal immigrants\n\nde blasio's announcement last week came after california's new democratic gov. gavin newsom outlined a similar health care agenda for his state, offering more benefits to illegal immigrants while protecting obamacare.\n\nmeanwhile, the new class of freshman democratic lawmakers includes many offering their own liberal proposals.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., has embraced 'medicare-for-all' and pitched a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive green new deal -- which aims to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expand energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable resources.\n\nthe plan also aims to eliminate poverty in the united states, and includes a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, according to a draft text of the plan that circulated around congress this month.\n\nthat plan has garnered support from at least eight declared or potential 2020 democratic candidates: rep. eric swalwell, d-calif.; sens. elizabeth warren, d-mass., cory booker, d-n.j., bernie sanders, i-vt., and jeff merkley, d-ore.; obama hud secretary julian castro; rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii; and former texas rep. beto o'rourke.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nmeanwhile, de blasio on sunday said he wouldn't rule out running for president in 2020.\n\ni never rule things out because you never know what life brings, he told cnn. but i'm focused on the work i'm doing now and getting this message out.\n\nfox news' adam shaw contributed to this report.
this is a rush transcript from the kelly file, november 14, 2014. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nmegyn kelly, host: constitutional lawyer jonathan turley who is a liberal has been warning against the dangers of executive overreach for over a year now even testifying before congress. watch.\n\n(begin video clips)\n\njonathan turley, constitutional attorney, dec. 3, 2013: you have the rise of an uber presidency. there could be no greater danger for individual liberty. and i really think that the framers would be horrified.\n\nturley, feb. 26: i believe we are now in a constitutional tipping point in our system. it's a dangerous point for our system to be in.\n\nturley, july 16: he has said that he's going to resolve the deadlock in congress, the division with congress, by ordering changes on his own terms as a majority of one. that's what makes it dangerous.\n\n(end video clips)\n\nkelly: joining me now, jonathan turley, constitutional attorney and professor at george washington university. good to see you again, professor.\n\nand so, you have spoken out about this through president bush's years and now through president obama's years and talked about the rise of an uber presidency. is the president in your view about to violate the separation of powers if he goes ahead and does this?\n\nturley: well, megyn, we're waiting for the details, but what i'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate separation of powers. supreme court has already ruled that this president has violated the separation of powers. they just took another case a week ago in the aca obamacare area about whether he had another violation in that area.\n\nand this certainly raises the same profile. the president's expressing frustration that congress is not doing what he thinks congress has to do. but of course he's a different branch. and we have three branches in this system. and no president can take on the powers of all three branches. and that's what he seems to be doing. he certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. he isn't being particularly coy about this. you know, he says this is what i wanted to get out of legislation. and i'm going to do it on my own. and that does become a government of one.\n\nkelly: right. i mean, he had control, the democrats of the house and senate, he didn't prioritize this. he didn't push for it. and when the democrats lost the house, years after he decided to push for it and he couldn't get it through. it's not like he's never believed that this is within congress' authority. he tried. congress said, no. and who are these congressmen? not just some random people who i don't know how they wound up in washington. they're the people's representatives. they get a vote. their vote was no. and now he's just so irritated, he said, well, too bad. i'm going to do it on my own. how can that be? how can that be allowed?\n\nturley: well, it's a very sad moment. but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward particularly after this election to defy the will of congress yet again. i can understand the frustration. these are obviously two parties that are not getting along. but as you said we do have a democratic process. we have a congress that is coming in with the full voice of the american people behind them. that's what an election is. now, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.\n\nwhat the president's suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution. we have a separation of powers that gives us balance. and that doesn't protect the branches. it's not there to protect the executive branch or legislative branch. it's to protect liberty. it's to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty. and i'm afraid -- go ahead. i'm sorry.\n\nkelly: right. this isn't about how you feel about what should be done about the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country. you can very much want a path to legalization for them. you could be behind the president's, you know, original plan submitted to congress that was passed by the senate. what this is about is what a president gets to do when an elected branch says, no to his agenda. and the framers decided that a long time ago.\n\nturley: well, i think that's right. and i think what i tell a lot of my friends on the democratic side is that we will rule the day that you help create this uber presidency. it's been developing a long time. but is reaching a very dangerous point. this will not be our last president. and you may not agree with the next one. but what the democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. they're creating a president who can go it alone. and to go it alone is something that is a very danger that the framers sought to avoid in our constitution.\n\nkelly: yes. i said last night to charles krauthammer, how will they like it if they get a republican president in there who says, you know what, i don't like these laws that prevent protests outside of abortion clinics, so i'm just going to use my discretion not to pursue any prosecutions against those people. and protest against abortion clinics grow so loud and so big that nobody can go into these clinics and get an abortion, well, so be it because that's a matter of my discretion.\n\ni mean, you have to be very careful what you wish for when empowering the executive.\n\ni want to ask you one other thing which is, what should republicans, or democrats for that matter, who object to what he is likely about to do, do in response?\n\nturley: well, it does sound like congress is going to aggressively assert its authority through legislation and other means. what congress and what the american people have to insist on from this president is a limiting principle. what the president is saying lacks a limiting principle. he's basically saying if these reports are correct that he can claim discretion to simply not enforce a federal law. well, that comes very close if doesn't cross the line of legislation. if a president can do that, as you've said, he can do that with environmental laws or anti-discrimination laws. the american people have got to force this issue and say, look, we may agree with you on what you're trying to do. but we don't agree how you're trying to do it.\n\nkelly: right. that's not the point. agreement on the underlying principle.\n\nand so, you know, if he goes ahead and does it, i mean, obviously the next president could undo it. that might cause all sorts of logistical problems. but, what, i mean, right now senator jeff sessions, who is going to take over as the budget committee chief, says, i'm going to try to deny the funding. i'm going to try to sort of take away his ability to issue temporary worker cards to anybody. but there's been some questions about whether that could work. there's a lawsuit already pending against him. there's a question whether that is feckless. some people have talked about impeaching the president. the republicans seem to feel that's too politically dangerous. so as a practical matter, is he just probably going to get away with it?\n\nturley: well, i hope that he does not get away with it if what we're talking about is a circumvention of the separation of powers. because that is the very thumping heart of our constitutional system.\n\nas for what congress can do, they have to use every resource available. you know, the president has made a mockery of the power of the purse. you can't just rely on that. it's like running a nuclear reactor with an on/off switch. it doesn't really do what people think it does. it's very hard to use appropriations to control a president who is engaging an overreach.\n\nbut you have a great array of option. and the congress appears to be exploring that. i think impeachment is the one that i would caution people not to look to in favor of some of these other options. i testified in the clinton impeachment, i represented the last judge impeached, it's not a road you want to go down unless there's any other option.\n\nkelly: i'm almost out of time. i've got to get this in quickly. to those who say many presidents have issued executive orders on immigration, none near this sweeping, what say you?\n\nturley: oh, this would be unprecedented and i think it would be an unprecedented threat to the balance of powers within our system.\n\nkelly: jonathan turley, great to see you, sir.\n\nturley: thank you, megyn.\n\nkelly: all the best, professor.\n\ncontent and programming copyright 2014 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. copyright 2014 cq-roll call, inc. all materials herein are

school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic are going to set an entire generation back, former michigan u.s. senate candidate john james warned on fox news primetime thursday.\n\ni believe that right now this is not a matter of democrat or republican, james told host katie pavlich. it's a matter of policies that work and policies that don't. it's a matter of what is best for our children and what is not.\n\nthe republican insisted that what is best for our children, according to the cdc and according to science, is in-person education.\n\nright now, we are in a situation where truancy is at an all-time high, the achievement is at an all-time low. and if you can't read, you can't work, james added.\n\ncalifornia board member compares reopening schools to 'white supremacist ideology' and 'slavery'\n\nwhat makes the closures even more harmful, james argued, is the fact that poor, disabled and minority children are most affected by them.\n\nsome of the people making these decisions still have black lives matter yard signs on their lawn, and they're perpetuating the most racially divided educational system since the jim crow era all over the country, he said. this is something that is is a basic civil right that's being violated, not just of black children, of all children, but black children are disproportionately negatively affected.\n\nmake no mistake, our education system was far from perfect before the pandemic in places like detroit, he added. the literacy level was far below, far below the national average. in fact, our state had to settle with former students who believe and i agree, that literacy is a basic civil right. i believe that a quality education means a basic civil right and anyone who stands in the way of that should be held accountable.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\njames argued that safely and sensibly opening is the democrat version of 'repeal and replace [obamacare]'.\n\nwhen you hear that from officials, they have no plan, and they have no plan because they're afraid of being wrong and they're afraid of being wrong because they care more about getting re-elected than they care about our children's futures, he explained. that's wrong. they should be accountable.

'understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, i spoke this morning with the chairman of the senate ethics committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,' burr said in a statement. the sales included stocks in hotels and restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. in his statement, burr said he had relied specifically on 'cnbc's daily health and science reporting out of its asia bureaus.'\n\n\n\nsenate newbie kelly loeffler also sold off stocks - daily beast: the senate's newest member sold off seven figures' worth of stock holdings in the days and weeks after a private, all-senators meeting on the novel coronavirus that subsequently hammered u.s. equities. sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the senate health committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the cdc director and anthony fauci, the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, on the coronavirus. … that first transaction was a sale of stock in the company resideo technologies valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. the company's stock price has fallen by more than half since then… it was the first of 29 stock transactions that loeffler and her husband made through mid-february, all but two of which were sales.\n\n\n\ninhofe and feinstein, too - ny post: two more senators made hefty stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic tanked global markets, records revealed as two other lawmakers who dumped millions in shares faced mounting calls to resign. sens. dianne feinstein and jim inhofe sold as much as $6.4 million worth of stock in the weeks before panic about the coronavirus sparked a worldwide selloff, according to disclosure filings… feinstein, a california democrat, sold $500,001 to $1 million worth of stock in a company called allogene therapeutics on jan. 31, less than a month before panic about the virus caused markets to plunge, senate records show. her husband sold $1,000,001 to $5 million worth of allogene shares on feb. 18, according to financial disclosures. and inhofe, an oklahoma republican, dumped as much as $400,000 worth of stock on jan. 27, records show. he sold shares in five different companies including apple, paypal and brookfield asset management, according to a disclosure report.\n\n\n\nadministration seeks to keep economic bad news under wraps - wsj: the trump administration asked states to abstain from releasing unemployment claims fig­ures prior to the publication of a national compilation of weekly u.s. jobless claims, according to a state labor department official. the official cited an email sent on wednesday from gay gilbert, an administrator at the u.s. labor department. ... the emailed message asked states to keep the numbers embargoed until the national claims figures are released each thursday, the state official said. the number of americans applying for first time unemployment benefits jumped last week in a spike tied to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing by 70,000 to 281,000, the fourth biggest weekly increase on record go­ing back to 1967. state level anecdotes suggest jobless claims could hit more than 2 million in next thursday's report, an unprecedented level, according to a note from goldman sachs.\n\n\n\nthe rulebook: rock solid\n\na firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. – alexander hamilton, federalist no. 9\n\n\n\ntime out: best political books list\n\nso it's been a week, and you're starting to get a little bit of ranch fever. okay, maybe a lot. you're following the good advice to keep some structure in your day, especially if there are younger ones around. you're attending to your intellectual, physical and spiritual needs, getting plenty of fresh air and going to bed before 11 o'clock. but you still feel the strains of isolation and loss of routine. so read a book! not just any book, but a world-class book that will hold your attention, expand your mind and transport you to someplace else entirely. there are lots of lists of great books out there for generalists. but what about political books? glad you asked... here is the halftime report's latest and greatest list of the best political books to read:\n\n\n\nshelley's heart by charles mccarry (1995) - this remains, by our lights, the best novel about washington and american politics ever written. when you realize how much of what mccarry wrote about politics was prophetic, it gets even better. it would be an engrossing thriller even without its political insights, but with them it's just… *italian chef kissing fingers emoji*\n\n\n\nall the king's men by robert penn warren (1946) - you know the king in this novel, willie stark, better as his real-world inspiration, louisiana's dictatorial governor of the 1930s, huey long. warren's writing is so good and his characters so real that you will practically smell the acrid cigar smoke and whiskey in the back room of slade's pool hall. if you never read it -- or never gave it a chance as required reading in school -- you owe it to yourself.\n\n\n\nbrave new world by aldus huxley (1931) - huxley's vision of a 26th century world free from want and dedicated to the pursuit of personal happiness fueled by prescription drugs must have seemed utterly bizarre to his contemporaries. but with each passing decade, his vision of a rigidly enforced social code and the dangers of a mob mentality have come to seem more and more prescient.\n\n\n\nthe gay place by billy lee brammer (1962) - brammer was a texas newspaperman who joined the staff of then-sen. lyndon johnson as he was reaching the pinnacle of his power in the senate. the book is a collection of three novellas that beautifully, achingly capture the world of hacks and flacks in post-wwii texas with all their human frailty. it was the only work brammer, a tragic figure himself, ever completed.\n\n\n\nbonfire of the vanities by tom wolfe (1987) - we know this isn't a political book, per se. but boy is it a great insight on the way the world of politics functions. wolfe's masterwork, set in the heady days of mid-1980s manhattan, provides amazing insight on the way racial politics, media muckraking, politicians' opportunism and cultural trends shape the way we are governed.\n\n\n\nflag on the play?

'these provisions will be enforced,' the governor said at a briefing in albany. 'these are not helpful hints.' they will take effect sunday night. even as he told new yorkers to stay indoors, mr. cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other.\n\n\n\nnewsom orders california's nearly 40 millions residents to stay home - sacramento bee: all californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, gov. gavin newsom ordered thursday. 'it's time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,' he said at an evening press conference. newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging californians to influence one another to do the right thing. 'i don't believe the people of california need to be told through law enforcement to home isolate, protect themselves,' he said. more than a quarter of the state's residents were already under some type of shelter in place or stay at home orders, including in sacramento county.\n\n\n\nfederal travel ban expands - usa today: the u.s.-mexico border will be closed to nonessential travel to further help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, president donald trump announced friday. 'as we did with canada, we're also working with mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,' trump said. 'these new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.' trump said that mexico is also suspending air travel from europe. secretary of state mike pompeo said the u.s. has taken 'two important steps' this week to curb the spread of the virus. he noted the border closure with canada, announced wednesday, would go into effect at midnight. he said the closure would last 30 days and reiterated the news trump shared that the border with mexico would also close.\n\n\n\ngovernors clamor for more federal controls - fox news: despite pleas from governors, members of congress and presidential candidates, president trump so far has resisted using his powers under the defense production act as officials look to ramp up the american medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. on wednesday, trump invoked the defense production act… but as of friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting wednesday that he only signed the act 'should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. hopefully there will be no need....' that has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (ppe) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. a potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple tv medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals.\n\n\n\nmcconnell sets monday deadline on stimulus deal - bloomberg: senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he wants the chamber to finish and pass a massive stimulus bill to bolster the economy by monday -- lightning speed for legislation expected to top $1 trillion. mcconnell, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived at the capitol friday morning for a blitz of bipartisan negotiations, with all sides stressing the need to act fast. 'i've tasked the bipartisan team to reach an agreement by the end of the day today,' mcconnell said at the capitol. getting a deal done friday would give bill drafters saturday to write up the text, with mcconnell planning to start the process for teeing up votes on monday. eric ueland, the white house legislative liaison, also stressed the need for speed. … he noted that mnuchin said he wants congress to complete action on the bill by monday 'to ensure that aid swiftly gets to the american people as well as to provide confidence with the american economy, and american markets.'\n\n\n\nplan has payments of $1,200 per person for middle class and poor - fox news: saying lawmakers 'need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,' senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the u.s. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. the draft legislation, obtained by fox news, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. the rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer's income exceeds the legislation's threshold. the amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. the irs would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return...\n\n\n\ncontinetti: coronavirus tests america's social capacity - free beacon: a few months after september 11, 2001, david brooks went back and looked at coverage of pearl harbor for an article in the weekly standard ('after pearl harbor,' december 10, 2001). … i revisited brooks's article this week while thinking about the differences between america during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and america during the wuhan coronavirus pandemic today. … what changed is the american ethos. expressive individualism replaced self-restraint. narcissism and the therapeutic sensibility triumphed over the reticence and sense of tragedy that comes from living in places and times where there is no safety net and death is a constant presence. the culture of debunking, revisionism, and repudiation informs education, entertainment, art, and occasionally sport.\n\n\n\ndem women under microscope as running mates\n\nnyt: [former vice president joe biden] has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. that has opened the path for democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. in discussions with the times since mr. biden's big primary victories on tuesday, 60 democratic national committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of mr. biden as his running mate — senator kamala harris of california, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. next up was stacey abrams, a former state house leader whose defeat in 2018 georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party. other popular suggestions included senator catherine cortez masto of nevada and representative val demings of florida. the democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including govs. gretchen whitmer of michigan and michelle lujan grisham of new mexico.\n\n\n\nbloomy transfers $18 million from campaign to dnc - politico: mike bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the democratic national committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. the money will support the dnc's 'battleground build-up 2020' program, the dnc's initiative in 12 swing states across the country. the money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. 'this will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help democrats win up and down the ballot,' dnc chairman tom perez said in a statement. 'the dnc has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure donald trump is a one-term president.' the massive transfer signals a change of plans for bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super pac to take on president donald trump in 2020.\n\n\n\nreally going out on a limb… gillibrand backs biden - wapo: sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) threw her support behind former vice president joe biden on thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the democratic nominee for president. 'he's the absolute best candidate to defeat president trump, and i think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the american people in a way that no one else has,' gillibrand said in an interview with the washington post.

senators on both sides of the aisle rallied to the defense of the late sen. john mccain, r-ariz., on wednesday, after president trump launched a fresh round of attacks against the senator's legacy this week.\n\ntoday and every day i miss my good friend john mccain, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., tweeted. it was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine american hero in the senate. his memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes.\n\nromney 'can't understand' why trump would bash mccain\n\nmccain was highly regarded by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for both his bipartisan approach to negotiation, his six-term service in congress and his military service -- where he served in vietnam and was held prisoner and tortured for more than five years.\n\nbut trump and mccain repeatedly sparred with one another. in 2015, after mccain had said trump's platform had fired up the crazies, trump had mocked mccain's imprisonment in the vietnam war, saying: i like people that weren't captured.\n\nbut since mccain's death last year of brain cancer, trump has not abandoned the feud.\n\ndonald trump's feud with mccain family escalates: 'i was never a fan'\n\ni was never a fan of john mccain, and i never will be, trump told reporters in the oval office on tuesday, citing in particular mccain's vote against the repeal of obamacare in 2017.\n\nhe campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare for years and then it got to a vote and he said thumbs down, trump said.\n\nover the weekend, he blasted mccain for giving to the fbi an uncorroborated dossier alleging that moscow held compromising information on trump.\n\nhe quoted former independent counsel ken starr as saying this was unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain.\n\nhe had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace! he tweeted.\n\nthat caused sen. mitt romney, r-utah, to say he can't understand why trump would go after mccain, whom he called heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god.\n\non tuesday, sen. johnny isakson, r-ga., told conservative outlet the bulwark that america deserves better and that nobody is above common decency and respect for people that risk their life for your life.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ni just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the mccain family deserves better, i don't care if he's president of united states, owns all the real estate in new york, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us, he said.\n\nmeanwhile, democrats joined in pushing back against trump's comments, with senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y. announcing wednesday that he intends to introduce a resolution re-naming the russell senate building after mccain -- calling him an american hero.\n\nfox news' liam quinn and the associated press contributed to this report.
call me a skeptic, but i'm quite certain that house speaker nancy pelosi's recent claim to the washington post that i'm not for impeachment of president trump doesn't match her actual position on the issue.\n\nthe california congresswoman is a crafty career politician who specializes in telling the american people one thing and doing the exact opposite. in fact, she's risen to the top of the liberal pyramid because she is an extremely gifted manipulator.\n\nin january, pelosi's own daughter alexandra described her mother as a political leader who could cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding.\n\npelosi says she's opposed to impeaching trump: 'he's just not worth it'\n\nin the case of the trump impeachment question, pelosi has it all gamed out in advance and this most recent misleading statement is just part one.\n\ntake a look at the manner in which pelosi disclosed her phony not for impeachment stance to her political allies at the post: i'm not for impeachment. this is news. i'm going to give you some news right now because i haven't said this to any press person before.\n\nfirst, telling journalists that you're about to bless them with news – so please pay attention – tells you all you need to know about how pelosi games the mainstream media.\n\nsecond, with her coaching tip, pelosi was essentially instructing the anti-trump washington post to blow the statement up and make sure everyone talked about it. it's a lovely example of a liberal politician colluding with the liberal media.\n\nbut make no mistake about it. part one of pelosi's plan has been a success because everyone is talking about her claim to not want to impeach the president.\n\nit was important for pelosi to get her anti-impeachment claim out. she wants to be viewed as someone who isn't an overzealous supporter of the left's crazed march to impeachment.\n\npelosi knows she can't be seen as following the lead of the unhinged rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich., in her quest to impeach the president, who tlaib described with an obscene term.\n\nthe democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.\n\nrather, the speaker of the house wants to be perceived as someone who is measured and comes around to support the witch hunt against the president after reviewing what she deems are facts.\n\nso while everyone is talking about pelosi's manufactured head fake, her investigative committee chairmen are loading their subpoena cannons and aiming them at anything or anyone close to president trump.\n\nlook no further than the house judiciary committee, which would hold impeachment hearings if they take place. chairman jerrold nadler, d-n.y., has issued 81 horribly overreaching document requests.\n\nmeanwhile, intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., has hired a former federal prosecutor to aid his desperate scattershot probe of the president.\n\nand oversight committee member rep. gerry connolly, d-va., makes wild witness comparisons to president nixon's aide alexander butterfield in the watergate scandal without one iota of evidence to back them up.\n\nthe democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.\n\npartisan investigations such as these should not be treated as legitimate exercises of congressional oversight. no one should participate in these taxpayer-funded witch hunts because the final report by special counsel robert mueller will put to rest many of the questions that democrats and their associates in the mainstream media have been hyperventilating over for two years – and its answers will not fit with their false narrative.\n\neveryone knows that pelosi – who was first elected to the house in 1987 – is an old-school machine democrat who rules from the top down with an iron fist. she recently warned vulnerable freshmen in her caucus who were voting with republicans that this is not a day at the beach. this is the congress of the united states.\n\nso does anyone think that pelosi would allow her committee chairs to go on these insanely partisan fishing expeditions without approval from the speaker's office?\n\npelosi went on to say in her interview with the post that she doesn't support impeachment because it divides the country. that's a topic pelosi knows a lot about. this is the same person who told the american people in 2017 that if the republican plan to repeal and replace obamacare passed, hundreds of thousands of people will die.\n\nrest assured, coming from pelosi, her comment on impeachment was a calculated political statement all the way. pelosi was simply getting out in front of what she knows will be a horribly divisive road to impeachment – one that she will be leading.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nwhen the time comes, pelosi will be able to say that she didn't want to move forward, but the so-called facts forced her hand. it's this type of political gamesmanship that the american people have come to loathe.\n\nlet's face it; pelosi couldn't even stand up to radical rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., over omar's anti-semitic comments. does anyone really think pelosi will stand up to the angry socialist mob over impeachment? who's she trying to kid?\n\nclick here to read more by david bossie
president trump, speaking at a fox news town hall in joe biden's hometown of scranton, pa., on thursday evening, openly suggested that the new democratic front-runner's repeated gaffes could be a sign of a competency issue -- honing a line of attack that republicans are expected to repeatedly deploy if biden becomes his party's nominee.\n\ntrump also wasted little time in criticizing ex-rival elizabeth warren's decision to drop out of the race only after super tuesday, saying she may have sabotaged bernie sanders' struggling presidential bid by siphoning the progressive vote.\n\nthe setting was more casual and conversational than trump's boisterous rallies, and afforded the commander-in-chief an opportunity to connect directly with voters on camera.\n\nnext image 1 of 15\n\nprev

won five, six, seven states, trump remarked. when you look at it, she did him no favors. that was not a good friendship. we started to see that during the debates, by the way. it became unhinged.\n\ntrump went on to argue that biden was damaged by the impeachment process that implicated his son hunter in apparent overseas corruption while biden was vice president. they aimed at trump and they took biden down, the president said.\n\nhere's a guy, who didn't have a job, unfortunately sadly the military was a very sad experience for him -- he goes out and gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt, he continued. just as bad, china -- i just made a great china deal ... his son walks out a china for a billion-and-a-half dollars for a fund.\n\nthe super tuesday results, trump said, had come as a surprise -- especially given what he suggested were biden's possible cognitive impairments.\n\ni'm all set for bernie, communist, trump began. and then we have this crazy thing that happened on tuesday, which he thought was thursday. but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the u.s. senate -- there's something going on there.\n\nhunter biden scandals explained: ukraine, cocaine and more\n\nthe president noted that he hadn't spoken to former president obama since the 2018 funeral for president george h.w. bush, in part because of lingering animosity about that administration.\n\ni sat next to him, i said, 'hello,' trump said, describing the funeral. then i said, 'goodbye' that's about it. i didn't like the job he did. i didn't like the job he and biden did. i didn't like the position he put us in. i didn't like what he did to our military. ... right now we have more ammunition than ever before.\n\nconcerning health care, trump said he was most disappointed that he hasn't been able to sell what a great job we've done. the president touted his administration's termination of the obamacare individual mandate, and said plans were now less expensive -- but that the carcass of obamacare remains a problem.\n\nwithout the whole thing with the individual mandate, it's a whole different ball game, trump said. he promised that the gop would come up with an alternative, but didn't offer specifics other than that pre-existing conditions would be covered.\n\nanchor bret baier noted that trump, when campaigning, had promised to erase the national debt within eight years -- but nevertheless had approved $4.6 trillion in new debt already.\n\ni'll always talk about it, because to me it's very important, trump said. the good thing about the debt is we're paying almost no interest. he added that more cuts would be coming but that it was crucially important to fund the military in the meantime.\n\nthey aimed at trump and they took biden down. — president trump, referring to the impeachment process\n\nthe town hall covered an array of other topics, including stock market turbulence and deregulation. out of the gate, trump defended his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying his decision to limit travel from china had averted a broader domestic crisis.\n\ni think people are viewing us as doing a very good job, trump told a questioner. this started in china. how it started, is a question. ... it's gonna all work out. everyone has to be calm.\n\nthe president pointed to something of a silver lining in the episode: people are now staying in the united states, spending their money in the united states, and i like that. you know, i've been after that for a long time. i've been saying, let's stay in the u.s., spend your money here. it's sort of enforced doing that.\n\ntrump later noted that he has always disliked the concept of shaking hands: if there was ever a time you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it, he mused, before lamenting that politicians unfortunately are required to shake some hands.\n\nresponding to the threatening statements directed at associate justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on wednesday by sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., trump said the comments amounted to a call for physical violence.\n\nif a republican did what schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, trump said to applause.\n\nthe media, trump argued, was a part of the democrat party to a large extent -- and we have to fight back.\n\nhe gave a similar answer when asked by a voter how he would bring us together. the voter noted that a relative had banished trump supporters from the family.\n\nsuccess as a country is the solution, trump said, suggesting that democrats would come to the bargaining table, if not the dinner table, if he won reelection.\n\nat the same time, trump said, when they hit us, we have to hit back.\n\nhours before the town hall, trump took his trademarked parting shots at warren and mike bloomberg, whom trump likened to an incompetent, undersized darth vader-style character from the 1987 parody spaceballs.\n\nbloomberg had compared trump to vader with a video from the movie star wars.\n\nelizabeth 'pocahontas' warren, who was going nowhere except into mini mike's head, just dropped out of the democrat primary...three days too late, trump wrote, referring to warren's previous claims of native american ancestry. she cost crazy bernie, at least, massachusetts, minnesota and texas. probably cost him the nomination! came in third in mass.\n\nthe fox news town hall was trump's first town hall of the campaign season. it was also trump's first discussion with baier and martha maccallum since interviews in june 2018 and april 2017.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nfox

a report that another provision of obamacare -- one that would cap out-of-pocket health care costs -- was being delayed brought a defiant challenge tuesday from a top senate republican, accusing the president of illegal and unconstitutional acts in changing laws without congressional approval.\n\nthe president doesn't get to write legislation, and it's illegal and unconstitutional for him to try and change legislation by himself, sen. rand paul, r-ky., told fox news.\n\nthe new york times first reported on tuesday that the administration is giving some insurers and employers a one-year grace period to adhere to the limit, which otherwise would have capped individual costs at $6,350 a year. the full requirement will go into effect in 2015, rather than 2014. the change means some employers -- namely, those with more than one benefit provider -- could use plans with higher limits or no limit at all on out-of-pocket costs during that period.\n\nthe grace period apparently was granted earlier this year, though was buried in reams of regulatory material and was not publicly reported until now. department of labor guidelines published in february had addressed the delay.\n\nthe confirmation comes weeks after the administration announced it was delaying a key insurance mandate -- the requirement on mid-sized and large businesses to provide coverage to full-time workers. the mandate, and the cap on costs, were both delayed for one year, in a move officials claimed was meant to give businesses more time to prepare.\n\naccording to the times, the decision to delay the cap on costs was made because many employers said they needed to upgrade their computer systems. the issue was they used different systems to administer both medical coverage and drug coverage, and they were not set up to aggregate all the money an individual spends out of pocket.\n\nas a consequence of the delay, some health plans in 2014 will be able to keep separate caps for both medical care and drug plans, or have no cap at all on drug costs.\n\nin response to the report, an obama administration official stressed that the cap on individual spending for major medical coverage will still be in place in 2014, on time. it will then be expanded to cover other benefits the following year.\n\nfor the first time, new historic consumer protections under the affordable care act will protect consumers from the worst insurance company abuses, by banning discrimination based on a pre-existing health conditions, ending lifetime and annual limits on what an insurance company will cover, and capping out-of pocket spending to protect americans and their families, the official said.\n\nthe decision raises concerns that, at least for next year, the health care law will not save people as much money as president obama claimed. on the campaign trail, obama has touted caps on out-of-pocket costs as a selling point.\n\ninsurance companies could still raise premiums to offset some of the lost revenue from caps on out-of-pocket costs. the law, though, does aim to keep premium increases in check, and barring any other delays would still prevent health insurers from denying coverage or charging more based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe delay opened the door to more criticism from republicans who say the law is not ready for prime-time -- and ultimately want it repealed anyway.\n\nsen. john barrasso, r-wyo., pointed to the delay in reviving his call to start over on the law.\n\nthe reason this law keeps getting delayed is because it doesn't work like the president promised it would work, he said in a statement.\n\nthe administration maintains it is able to make adjustments to the implementation of any law.\n\nobama defended the law, and its implementation, during a press conference last friday. he blasted republicans for their sustained campaign against the law, saying there's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.\n\nit's just become an ideological fixation, obama said, adding: there is no doubt that in implementing the affordable care act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. ... that's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. it's true of apple rolling out the new ipad.
here are my 10 takeaways from the new hampshire democratic primary, which sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., narrowly won with almost 26 percent of the vote, followed closely by former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg in second-place with just over 24 percent, with 87 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar of minnesota came in a strong third with almost 20 percent, while sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts trailed at a distant fourth with just over 9 percent. former vice president joe biden was in fifth place with just over 8 percent. no other candidate managed to reach even 4 percent of the vote.\n\none: polls can be reliable\n\nmost polls – especially the most recent polls – showed sanders leading or winning in new hampshire. the polls were accurate, though buttigieg came close to scoring an upset.\n\nnew hampshire gives klobuchar major boost, puts biden and warren on 2020 life support\n\ntwo: the fat lady hasn't sung yet\n\nentrepreneur andrew yang and sen. michael bennet of colorado dropped out of the race for the democratic presidential nomination, but nine candidates remain in a field that once had over two dozen presidential hopefuls.\n\nwhile some candidates at the back of the pack have virtually no chance of winning their party's nomination, i wouldn't count out warren and biden. i agree with their decision to stay in the race.\n\nas biden said: it ain't over man, we're just getting started.\n\nthe iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary are important because they are the first two nominating contests. but the two states have small populations with few african-american and hispanic voters. the next two nominating contests – in nevada feb. 22 and south carolina feb. 29 – are in states with much more diverse populations, where biden, in particular, has enjoyed strong support.\n\nthen comes super tuesday on march 3, when voters in alabama, american samoa, arkansas, california, colorado, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, texas, vermont and virginia cast ballots for their choice for the democratic presidential nominee.\n\nthe results in all these states won't necessarily mirror the results in iowa and new hampshire.\n\nbut just because biden is carrying on doesn't mean he should carry on this campaign the same way. something has to change.\n\nbiden has to step up his game in the debates and reevaluate why he once topped the polls in iowa and new hampshire but then fell flat when voting was held.\n\nthe former vice president needs to change it up to get more people to come out and vote for him by getting them more excited about his candidacy. he can't just count on states like south carolina with large minority populations.\n\nsignificantly, new polling shows former new york city mayor mike bloomberg's is picking up support among african-americans – a constituency that has been strongly supportive of biden in earlier polls.\n\nthree: endorsements matter\n\ni have always maintained that endorsements don't really do much for campaigns, but boy, was i wrong this time around in new hampshire. i'm specifically referring to the endorsements sanders received from democratic reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, ilhan omar of minnesota and rashida tlaib of michigan.\n\nthe endorsement of the three progressive freshmen congresswomen gave sanders an important boost that contributed to his new hampshire victory.\n\nfour: the democratic party is divided\n\namong the top five candidates in the new hampshire democratic primary, sanders and warren competed in the progressive lane, together getting just over 35 percent of the vote.\n\nbuttigieg, klobuchar and biden competed for the more moderate vote, and together captured almost 53 percent of the vote.\n\nthe remaining vote was split between candidates in the back of the pack.\n\nbloomberg – spending record amounts of his multibillion-dollar fortune on his campaign – wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire but is campaigning and advertising heavily in super tuesday states.\n\nfive: old school low-tech voting is best\n\nnew hampshire used paper ballots. the primary went off without a hitch and results came in early – quite a contrast to the failure of new technology used to tabulate votes in the iowa caucuses.\n\napps and computers can be hacked and break down. that can't happen with good old-fashioned paper ballots.\n\nsix: warren made a mistake picking a fight with sanders\n\nwarren was leading in polls in new hampshire just a few weeks ago. then she started a feud with sanders, claiming he had told her in private that a female candidate couldn't defeat president trump in the november election – a claim sanders strongly denied.\n\nthe feud appears to have cost warren votes – exactly the opposite effect she likely expected.\n\nwarren's poor showing in new hampshire is especially embarrassing for her because her home state of massachusetts borders new hampshire and that should have given her a geographical advantage. sanders is also from a neighboring state – vermont.\n\nseven: delegates count\n\nin the new hampshire primary, sanders and buttigieg each picked up nine delegates to the democratic national convention, while klobuchar picked up six. no other democratic picked up a single delegate. so while sanders won slightly more popular votes, the contest was a draw between him and buttigieg in the delegate count.\n\neight: there was no surge in voter turnout\n\npolling showed that new hampshire democratic voters are angry and want the democratic party to nominate a candidate who can defeat president trump in november.\n\nbut in iowa and new hampshire we didn't see the record turnout for the democratic caucuses and primaries that some had forecast.\n\ndemocrats will need a strong turnout of anti-trump voters to have a chance of defeating him in the general election.\n\nnine: candidate debates matter\n\nwith the exception of bloomberg, who hasn't yet qualified for a presidential candidate debate and wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire, candidates kept off the debate stage have fared poorly and many dropped out before voting in nominating contests began.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthe televised debates give the candidates valuable exposure and boost their status as serious contenders.\n\nklobuchar had a breakout performance at the democratic debate last week and that seems to have been a big factor that helped her vault past biden and warren in the new hampshire primary.\n\nten: health care wins again\n\nhealth care is a winning issue for democrats. as president trump and republicans seek to constantly undo obamacare and have no alternative plan, this is an issue that still is strongly resonating with voters.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\npolling shows that health care, followed by climate change, followed by the desire for a president who can unite our country are the three big concerns of many voters.\n\nin new hampshire, polls show 6 in 10 voters concerned about health care support a government-sponsored program like medicare-for-all.\n\nclick here to read more by leslie marshall
in his state of the union address tuesday night, president trump tried to make it sound like everything's coming up roses for the united states – and of course, he said all the credit belongs to him. but as a democrat, i believe the state of the union is not good – our nation is divided, and there is too much hatred and too little forgiveness.\n\nand there is no chance of improving things as long as trump remains president.\n\ntrump made a mistake in attacking something most voters care about. the president attacked the democrats on health care – but that issue helped democrats win elections in 2018, especially moderate democrats in red districts that trump won in 2016.\n\nnancy pelosi rips trump's state of the union address, sparking huge reactions\n\npolling in iowa, where democrats held their caucuses monday, showed that health care is the no. 1 issue among democratic voters – and polls show that health care is also a major concern for independents and republicans.\n\nby threatening (again) to dismantle obamacare – which millions of americans, including trump supporters, rely on it – trump could lose votes he needs to get reelected. this is not a smart move.\n\nboth the president's rhetoric and the democratic reaction shows we are more divided than ever.\n\nsome democratic senators and house members boycotted trump's state of the union address. some – like rep tim ryan, d-ohio, walked out. he tweeted: 'i just walked out of the state of the union. i've had enough. it's like watching professional wrestling. it's all fake.\n\nrep. bill pascrell, d-n.j., tweeted: i just walked out of the state of the union, i can't stand a liar. this man's presidency is a national tragedy.\n\non the other side of the aisle, republicans used social media to champion the president as a destroyer of democrats.\n\nwhile president trump promised to unite the nation, the truth is that he has only made america's divisions worse with his attacks on politicians, individuals and entire groups of people.\n\nthis was quite apparent tuesday night with the president's hateful rhetoric criminalizing immigrants and further inciting hatred and fear against them. yet the truth is that a majority of hispanic immigrants in the united states are law-abiding citizens.\n\ntrump singled out one person killed by one immigrant. but in fact, many more americans are killed by people born in the u.s.\n\ntrump also seeks to divide us by religion.\n\nin america, we celebrate faith. we cherish religion. we lift our voices in prayer. and we raise our sights to the glory of god, the president said. those are beautiful words, but trump's actions speak louder.\n\nmany of us on the left don't believe he embraces religious tolerance, due to his blatant attacks on muslims and his travel ban – which we call his muslim ban.\n\nevery child is a precious and sacred gift from god, trump said from one side of his mouth, while demonizing democrats and undocumented immigrants out of the other.\n\ntrump's immigration policies have resulted in sacred immigrant children being put in cages and separated from their parents. he is now keeping many pregnant women from entering the u.s. from abroad, to prevent their babies from being born as u.s. citizens.\n\ntrump also claims to believe in the first amendment, yet demonizes the media on an almost daily basis as enemies of the people, calls any media report that do not make him look good fake news, and has halted white house daily press briefings.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthe level of democratic vs. republican hostility in the house chamber, where the speech was delivered, was palpable.\n\ncoming off his impeachment by house democrats, trump refused to shake the extended hand of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., before he began his speech. pelosi ripped up the text of the president's speech right after he delivered it.\n\npelosi told fox news she destroyed the speech because it was the courteous thing to do considering the alternatives and said she was trying to find one page with truth on it but couldn't.\n\n\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nin addition, trump's state of the union address felt more like a campaign speech for someone running for reelection than a speech to democrats as well as republicans in congress. it lacked the formality, decorum and graciousness that a state of the union normally has.\n\nthis is the new normal under the trump presidency.\n\nclick here to read more by leslie marshall
in a significant defeat for former president donald trump, the supreme court on monday declined to step in to halt the turnover of his tax records to a new york prosecutor.\n\nthe court's action is the apparent culmination of a lengthy legal battle that had already reached the high court once before.\n\ntrump's tax records are not supposed to become public as part of prosecutor's criminal investigation, but the high court's action is a blow to trump because he has for so long fought on so many fronts to keep his tax records shielded from view. the ongoing investigation the records are part of could also become an issue for trump in his life after the presidency. trump has called it a fishing expedition and a continuation of the witch hunt — the greatest witch hunt in history.\n\nnj judge says lawyer who killed her son also tracked supreme court justice sotomayor\n\nthe supreme court waited months to act in the case. the last of the written briefs in the case was filed oct. 19. but a court that includes three trump appointees waited through the election, trump's challenge to his defeat and a month after trump left office before issuing its order.\n\nthe court offered no explanation for the delay, and the legal issue before the justices did not involve whether trump was due any special deference because he was president.\n\nthe court's order is a win for manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr., who has been seeking trump's tax records since 2019 as part of an investigation. vance, a democrat, had subpoenaed the records from the mazars accounting firm that has long done work for trump and his businesses. mazars has said it would comply with the subpoena, but trump, a republican, sued to block the records' release.\n\nbiden to get another judicial appointment to a key federal appeals court\n\nvance's office had said it would be free to enforce the subpoena and obtain the records in the event the supreme court declined to step in and halt the records' turnover, but it was unclear when that might happen.\n\nthe case the high court ruled in involves a grand jury subpoena for more than eight years of trump's personal and corporate tax records. vance has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records. in one court filing last year, however, prosecutors said they were justified in demanding the records because of public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the trump organization.\n\npart of the probe involves payments to two women — porn actress stormy daniels and model karen mcdougal — to keep them quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about alleged extramarital affairs with trump. trump has denied the affairs.\n\nin july, the justices in a 7-2 ruling rejected trump's argument that the president is immune from investigation while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the tax records.\n\nbiden admin tells supreme court obamacare is constitutional, a reversal of trump's doj stance in pending case\n\njustices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, whom trump nominated to the high court, joined that decision. it was issued before trump's third nominee, justice amy coney barrett, replaced the late justice ruth bader ginsburg on the court.\n\nas part of its july decision, the high court returned the vance case and a similar case involving records sought by congress to lower courts. and the court prevented the records from being turned over while the cases proceeded.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nsince the high court's ruling, in the vance case, trump's attorneys made additional arguments that his tax records should not be turned over, but they lost again in federal court in new york and on appeal. it was those rulings that trump had sought to put on hold.
rep. daniel lipinski, d-ill., a rare anti-abortion house democrat, has lost his party's primary race to challenger marie newman, a small business owner endorsed by far-left rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y.\n\nnewman challenged lipinski in 2018 and was edged out in a close primary race, but this time she managed to narrowly defeat the incumbent congressman, who has represented illinois' third district since 2005.\n\njussie smollett prosecutor wins primary\n\nthis is a democratic district. let's have a real democrat fighting for us, newman tweeted monday, including infographics showing how lipinski's past votes against obamacare and for restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions.\n\nthe win all but assures that newman, 55, will take over the seat that lipinski's father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot.\n\nnewman, a former management consultant who started and led an anti-bullying nonprofit, argued lipinski no longer reflected the views of the district, which backed sen. bernie sanders, a democratic socialist, over hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., endorsed newman back in september. she told the new york times that newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party — to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing.\n\nlipinski, 53, opposes abortion rights and voted against the affordable care act, president barack obama's 2010 health care overhaul.\n\nget the fox news app\n\nwhat a journey, newman said in a statement her campaign released tuesday night. i am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition who helped bring about much needed change in our district. we are going to work together to lower healthcare costs, to fight climate change, and to continue building a hospitable community for everyone, no matter where you come from.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report
this is a rush transcript from life, liberty & levin, january 20, 2019. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nmark levin, host: hello, america. i'm mark levin. this is life, liberty & levin. great guest again, curt schilling, how are you, my friend?\n\ncurt schilling, former baseball pitcher: i'm good. how are you?\n\nlevin: it's a pleasure.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: we've met in the past.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: but now we get to talk to each other and i'll tell you why i wanted you here because you fascinate me. a great athlete. you know, i'm from philadelphia. you played for the phillies for some time. you played for the diamondbacks. you played for boston, and a tremendous record. and also you're an outspoken conservative.\n\nnow first things first, 1993, you pitched in the world series with the phillies, they lost; 2001 arizona diamondbacks, 2004, 2007 boston red sox championships. you are an 11 and 2 post season record. i just want the nation to understand how phenomenal that is. that is the greatest postseason record of any pitcher who's pitched 10 or more games in the postseason and 8.846 winning percentage.\n\nand i'm doing this for a reason. so you have the major league record when it comes to that. you also struck out over 3,000 batters. one behind gibson. you're tied for third or one behind.\n\nschilling: one behind.\n\nlevin: one behind on third and you routinely and it's not that long ago you routinely pitch past six and seven innings which really isn't done anymore. this is a tremendous record.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: and you're not in the hall of fame. you're not in the hall of fame. is that because of your views? you think it's political?\n\nschilling: part of it is. i mean, it's not a guess. the people that have not voted for me specifically because of the things i've said or did, they've said it. they've about come out and said i can't vote for him because of what he said or what he did and --\n\nlevin: isn't that pretty outrageous? i mean, aren't they supposed to be voting based on your career as a baseball player? as an athlete? not whether they agree with your conservative views or not?\n\nschilling: well, the two words come up -- the character clause. and there's a couple of issues with that. first of all, i'm putting -- i'm now -- i've seen recently, i've been put in the in the clemens and bonds category. you know, character issues this and that, which kills me because roger clemens was such a big influence on my career, but i don't doubt for a second that i -- he cheated.\n\nthey are equating me and something they think i've done or said with guys who willingly did -- lance armstrong, in a sense destroyed other people's lives to preserve their legacy. we're on the same moral turf somehow.\n\nso my dad told me, don't ever live your life trying to please people you don't know and that's -- but you know, i've lived. you know, you can go back and look at 22 years of my career and you know, every -- i've never had an incident with a teammate. i meant, not a serious incident. every day, you have so fans, clubhouse guys --\n\nlevin: isn't this what they do to conservatives generally? look what they've done to the president of the united states.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: before he became a republican, before he decided to run, before he was the nominee, before he was president of the united states, the liberals loved them. the media loved him. hollywood loved him and they couldn't say enough good things about him. they took his money. they took his donations. they made money off of his program. all of that was well and good\n\nthen he decides to run for president the united states. the next thing you know, he's a reprobate. he's hitler. he's stalin. he's a thousand things that they say. isn't that what we all come up against? he came up against it. you came up against it. guys like me, we come up against it every single day. isn't it the effort to just destroy your reputation and your character if they can, rather than engage?\n\nschilling: i would argue, it's probably the same reason you have a hard time getting a liberal sit in this chair because the second you -- i'll converse and debate anybody. i am open -- one of the things i was when i played, i was coachable. i would listen to anybody about anything because it would help make me better.\n\nmy thirst for knowledge after i get done playing is the same. i'll debate, i'll talk to anybody about anything because military history is my passion outside of sports. and i read probably -- my mom taught me how to speed read when i was young, so i've got a stack of books about 15 high next to my bed. i read about a book at night.\n\ni find something i don't know and then i'll read it -- because a book is just someone else's interpretation of something that i can look up myself, but i want different perspectives and viewpoints because especially where we are now. you know, you look at where this country is now and --\n\nlevin: where is this country now?\n\nschilling: as conservatives, we're up against a group of people who don't have any forethought, who don't think ahead. you can't, in any realistic scenario in the real world play out this socialist dream and come to a conclusion that benefits the people. it's never worked anywhere ever.\n\nthere's no example where you can say -- they love the point --\n\nlevin: scandinavia.\n\nschilling: scandinavia and all the other things and they don't realize first of all, it doesn't scale. there's six or ten million people in those countries combined. we're over 300 million people and how many tens of millions of those people aren't even in the system, taking billions of dollars. it doesn't work.\n\nand so you know, you look at a generation. my kids are between 16 and 22, so they're in college and they're pretty conservative and they're listening to liberal professors say things and they'll text me and the only -- my son has one professor who said, i don't want you to take what i say at face value. i want you to challenge me. which is the first time you ever heard anybody left-of-center say that.\n\nlevin: so you think the country is moving in the wrong direction because of this socialist pressure that's in place in our schools, in our society, in the media even though there's a push back. the president the united states and other conservatives and so forth?\n\nschilling: here's the thing. i gamed this out, right? i mean, you know where we are right now. you're kind of in the eye of the storm in a sense given your influence on people on the right and the hatred that comes from the left for you, which means you're on target doing something right.\n\nbut you game this out. trump is going win in 2020. there is just no feasible way unless the russians and democrats get together again and try and rig another election, but he wins in 2020. they're not going to suddenly scale back. they'll be apoplectic, more so than they are now.\n\nlevin: you don't think this ends well?\n\nschilling: no, it doesn't. it can't end well because the left has proven that they won't let it end until they get their way.\n\nlevin: and that's an example on the wall.\n\nschilling: the wall is a great example. you were mentioning how much the left love trump. back when they were loving trump, they were also approving $25 billion and $40 billion to fund a wall because you can go back and look at the sound bytes of obama and clinton and everybody saying, we need this. we need border security.\n\nand all of a sudden, they hate it and they only hate it because president trump wants it. period.\n\nbut i'm -- i feel good about the thing. he's not going to give in. he is not going to end this shutdown until he gets his money.\n\nlevin: now, you're describing a political party that puts power before a country because why in the world would they change their position, everybody knows a nation needs to secure its border. everybody knows it's a bad thing for drugs and drug runners to come into the country. everybody knows that we need to know who's coming into this country.\n\nschilling: those are all common sense.\n\nlevin: all common sense, but they reject it. they don't reject it because it's irrational or bad policy or bad for the country. they reject it because it's bad for their own political fortunes and yet they have a propaganda machine at cnn and msnbc and in the new york times day-in day- out, you were talking about your kids. they have academia in their back pocket with tenured professors who are mostly hardcore left-wing and much like you in sports.\n\nleftist in sports can do pretty much whatever they want to do. they can take knees. they can do this. they can do that. conservatives in sports had to be very careful because even the sports media is quite left-wing.\n\nschilling: look, there's no better example in the last nine years. two athletes have been pretty much persona non grata. tim thomas carried the bruins to the stanley cup in 2011, did not go to the white house.\n\nlevin: for obama.\n\nschilling: he's like voldemort, he-who-must-not-be-named in -- i mean, he carried the bruins to a stanley cup and he was the greatest thing ever until then me, i said vote bush in 2004. it blew up. the patriots refused to go to the white house. they are icons. they are people to follow it's just and so --\n\nlike i said, you can't, like the hall of fame vote stuff. i can't live my life for those people to -- because they are never going to like you. there's a certain part of the world that just doesn't like you for whatever reason. the reasons they don't like me have to do with, i think character and integrity and morals and ethics and honor and all the things that my dad taught me to believe and we were talking earlier, i said -- one of the most powerful lessons in my life was roger clemens pulling me aside and talking about --\n\nmy dad passed away about eight months before i made my major league debut.\n\nlevin: he never saw any of this?\n\nschilling: no.\n\nlevin: no.\n\nschilling: no from ground level, anyway, but roger told me when you walk out in the field, the name on the back of your jersey, that's not your name, that's your father's name and i never forgot that.\n\ni left a ticket for my dad every game i ever played.\n\nlevin: really?\n\nschilling: i left a ticket -- there's an empty -- because i wanted an empty seat in the stadium during the world series, so he knew, next time i get a chance to talk to him, he's going to know i never forgot about him.\n\nlevin: you have flirted with running for office. massachusetts would be a tough place to run.\n\nschilling: i would -- yes, but that's -- i mean, that's why i chose boston over new york to play.\n\nlevin: really?\n\nschilling: oh, sure.\n\nlevin: why?\n\nschilling: because if i went to new york and helped them win the 28th and 29th world series, ho-hum. if i go to boston and break -- and help break the curse or whatever they call it, there's something no one's ever seen in there.\n\ni want the challenge. i wanted out -- you know, and it turned out to be partially a great thing, but i got i got what i asked for.\n\nlevin: do you think you'll run?\n\nschilling: no, not now. after i watched -- you know, when you look at what the left has done to people that they don't like especially politicians, when i watch the kavanagh hearing and realized that conservative wives, spouses and children are now in play for the media, my family doesn't deserve that. and they're not -- they spent 20 years following me around baseball. i'm not going to subject them to that.\n\nlevin: i want to talk more about that, the kavanagh hearings, your philosophy, your view of sports because sports to me seems to be following the democratic party, pretty much.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: folks don't forget to join us almost every weeknight on levin tv. go to blazetv.com/mark where you can sign up blazetv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-levin-tv, 844-levin-tv. a lot of conservatives are there. we would like you to join us. we'll be right back\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, was there an event, a book, a person your upbringing that caused you to be a conservative and a republican?\n\nschilling: no, my father was -- i grew up an army brat and i grew very lower middle class and i was fortunate enough to have a father who taught me the pride in ownership and what it feels like to work for something and i played sports. i was always about the winners and losers.\n\nlevin: competition.\n\nschilling: right. i mean, which is capitalism. i mean capitalism is -- i mean and i've been a victim of it, too with the studio that i opened, it ended up failing after i put over $50 million of my own money into it, but that's what happens.\n\nthe capitalism weeds out the weak and it's why we are where we are, but i think i entrenched my stance as a conservative when i when i was old enough to read and understand the constitution. i think i was like 11 and --\n\nlevin you're far ahead of nancy pelosi.\n\nschilling: right. she still doesn't, but that's fine. but i read it and it's a pretty cool document and then when you think about -- we were talking about foresight. the amount of foresight these men had to put this document together knowing full well that we are a horribly flawed species and that somebody somewhere was going to try and do many, many bad things to get it -- it's just mind-boggling to me that they were all that smart and we've gone through some changes as a country.\n\nwe've had to live through some of the worst things, but we fought a civil war to end slavery. nobody else did that. almost a million we're killed in a conflict to eliminate slavery. we have scars of the past, but those scars of the past, that's why we are where we are and there's -- i've been -- i've got to tell you, i've been wanting to get in front of you and ask you this question for the longest time.\n\nlevin: you ask me. go ahead.\n\nschilling: so when you talk about, you know, racist is the word everybody's throwing around. everybody's a racist. if you don't agree with us, you're a racist this and that, but i look at the civil war, all right and you know the three amendments that were passed post-civil war -- 13, 14, and 15 -- what they meant and what they did.\n\ni want to know why we had to have a civil rights movement in 1960 to give minorities the rights that they were given in 1870?\n\nlevin: i'll tell you why. and it's interesting you bring this up. those amendments had to be adopted by what? the states. and it's often said, while quote-unquote states rights, i call it federalism is a problem because you look at it pre-civil war, well, it's the states that fought the states.\n\nand i know it's the union, but then in the end it was states fighting states and it were states that passed the post-civil war amendments, abolishing slavery, conferring equal rights formally and due process on former slaves.\n\nand when you look at the declaration of independence, there's no reference there to religion, race, sex or anything --\n\nschilling: again, intentional.\n\nlevin: intentional. they were embracing not just the enlightenment, but aristotelian logic. the logic that came from cicero, who was murdered and all these people -- john locke -- who's on the wall there, montesquieu -- these were the great thinkers, the great minds of humanity and only in america when they set up the government did they embrace these things not marx who would come later.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: not hegel, who would come a little later, but was somewhat of a contemporary and rousseau, who was followed by the french and then they had 10 years of terrorism and the french revolution. the reason why there had to be a civil rights movement is because there was resistance, that word, particularly in the south among the old democrats and the democratic party.\n\nyou have to remember that as recently as 1924, at the democratic convention at madison square garden in new york, the klan controlled the convention.\n\nschilling: yes, i know.\n\nlevin: people don't know that franklin roosevelt's first appointment to the supreme court --\n\nschilling: was a member of klan.\n\nlevin: was a member of the klan in alabama who'd been a lawyer for the klan and his excuse was, i didn't know right.\n\nschilling: right, and i asked you that question because i wanted that answer but i also -- there's been -- our kids are miss-taught or are not taught the true history of this country and it's just -- i think it's damning to the education system, but the kkk was borne out of the end of the civil war because it was a way for the democrats to -- even those amendments were in play, we can make them fear us enough to keep them away from the polls and all the other stuff.\n\nlevin: while they hanged people. they raped people.\n\nschilling: they were. yes.\n\nlevin: they were terrorists even then.\n\nschilling: they were the terrorism arm of the democratic party. period. and you know, you have these people talking about the big switch in the sixties. there was one person that's switched and then you talk about what -- everybody that followed goldwater. goldwater --\n\nlevin: you're talking about strom thurmond.\n\nschilling: right, and everybody that voted against the civil rights with goldwater, well goldwater wasn't voting against civil rights, he was voting against giving the federal government more power.\n\nlevin: well, here's what i want to add to this. the first civil rights amendments were the post-civil war amendments. the first civil rights law was proposed by eisenhower in 1956. the '64 civil rights act, the '65 civil rights voting rights acts, the vast majority of republicans voted for both. i happen to disagree with goldwater on this.\n\ni understood his philosophy. he had no animus whatsoever. his was a constitutional argument. that's fine. the problem i have is that the democratic party and their mouthpieces in the media keep accusing republicans of what they were.\n\nwell, i think they have lurched in a completely different direction, a radical left direction.\n\nschilling: there's no doubt about that.\n\nlevin: and that's a very bleak place to take the country. very dangerous. we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nmarianne rafferty, correspondent, fox news: live from america's news headquarters, i'm marianne rafferty. a location is being narrowed down for president trump's second summit with north korean leader, kim jong-un. bloomberg news reporting the meetings is expected to be held in the vietnamese capital of hanoi. two other cities in vietnam are also being considered. the white house on friday said the president will meet with kim in late february. the leaders will continue talks on north korea's nuclear program.\n\nand u.s. skier lindsey vonn may have skied her last race. the olympic gold-medalist competed in a world cup super g event this weekend in italy. she failed to finish the last race of the weekend. this is her first event back after recovering from her latest knee injury. after the race, vonn said immediate retirement was a possibility that her injuries might get the best of her. i'm marianne rafferty. now back to life, liberty & levin.\n\nlevin: curt schilling, were you always a republican?\n\nschilling: i think i was. i registered and when i registered in 18, i registered as an independent and i think i was -- and i think to this day, i'm probably more an independent republican because i think socially, i'm very progressive, but fiscally i'm not.\n\nlevin: socially your view is be and let be.\n\nschilling: i don't care who you sleep with. i don't care about any of the other things that i have might -- i have a son on the spectrum and he is one of the greatest human beings you're ever going to meet and he formed the lgbtq club in high school.\n\nand now as far as i know, he's straight. i don't know, i don't really care, but i've had kids coming into my house for eight years that are gay, that our transgender, that are making the change from boy to girl, girl boy. i don't use pronouns around grant's friend just because i don't want get in trouble with them but --\n\nlevin: i use pronouns because i don't know what else to say.\n\nschilling: and they're the greatest kids in the world, and i keep telling them who you are dating? that's absolutely nothing to do with --\n\nlevin: but you're not a republican because of that.\n\nschilling: right.\n\nlevin: you're a republican why?\n\nschilling: i'm a republican because i love competition. i think competition brings out the best in human beings. i think --\n\nlevin: so this whole notion of centralized government, of uniformity, of redistributing wealth, kind of destroys all those motivations and principles.\n\nschilling: well, here's the thing. i'm -- the second you say you're against obamacare, you're hoping people die according to the media. i want everybody to have healthcare. first of all, let's be clear.\n\nno one can -- you can't be denied healthcare.\n\nlevin: right, you go into -- that's federal law.\n\nschilling: you can't be denied -- you keep walking in it -- you cannot be -- you can be denied health insurance, but you can't be denied healthcare. the fact that of the matter is, in capitalism, if we force people to -- under a single-payer government-run healthcare system, then we are going to be telling people who go to medical school to become doctors just how much money they're allowed to make every year and that's that slippery slope.\n\nand when has our government ever proven to us that they are fiscally competent?\n\nlevin: and i have this question for you. when bernie sanders talks about government, when elizabeth warren talks about government, when all of these people talk about government, can they give us some names? in other words, exactly who's going to the healthcare system? and exactly where do these experts come from? they're not experts. they're people who are in the bureaucracy. they are civil servants. they're members of unions in some cases, some of them have seniority. do they have expert tests?\n\nso basically what these leftists are telling us is that the people in the bureaucracy are smarter, more experienced, more noble than all the plebes out there.\n\nschilling: but isn't that the message they've been telling us?\n\nlevin: yes, but how is that the case?\n\nschilling: right, no but they've been making it clear to us as conservatives that we're deplorable. you're just stupid rednecks and we know better than you so just shut up and let us do what we do.\n\nlevin: but we pay most of the bills.\n\nschilling: with no background of success in doing anything. the government is never -- that's why capitalism -- private sector has kicked the crap out of the government forever because of the competition.\n\nlevin: are you happy -- you're republican. are you happy with how the republicans generally conduct themselves in congress?\n\nschilling: no.\n\nlevin: why not?\n\nschilling: no, because i think the republic -- most of the republicans in congress stopped representing me about seven or eight years ago and started representing themselves and running for office the day they got into office.\n\nlevin: is it because they don't stand for conservative principles? is it because they don't fight?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: they drive up the debt? what is it?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: all of these things?\n\nschilling: yes. the democrats, when they want something, they don't care. they'll go -- they'll ruin your life. they'll ruin lives. they'll do whatever they need to do to get what they want. we've always been, excuse me. may i, please. i'm sorry. in the sense that you know, we don't want to play dirty pool because we don't believe that dirty pool is a way to play.\n\nbut when two groups are competing on a playing field and they're playing by separate rules, it's not a fair game and that's exactly what's happened. the republican party -- the freedom caucus has more my speed now -- jim jordan and the guys --\n\nlevin: who are conservative elements.\n\nschilling: yes, they're -- that's what a conservative is. a conservative looks at the constitution as an ironclad document. it's easy, it's simple, it makes sense and it's perfect.\n\nlevin: what do you of this battle over the budget and the wall and the state of the union? what do you make of all that?\n\nschilling: well, i find it ironic. i don't know if irony is the right word, but a couple years ago, i remember before the election, weren't we all screaming for something different? we don't want a career politician. we want somebody to break the mold.\n\nyou couldn't break the mold any more than we broke it with the guy we put in there. he's not a politician. this is what it looks like when you put someone who isn't a politician in the oval office, which is -- he's a pragmatist. he's a problem solver and that's what he's done. he's put up --\n\nlevin: yes, he's very conservative.\n\nschilling: he is very conservative, but he's the first politician in our lifetime that kept his work. that's why i believe -- and mr. president, if you're watching this show, do not give in. the american people are behind you. don't give in until the democrats give you what they were giving each other ten years ago, that $40 million or $50 million for the wall, a billion dollars for the wall.\n\nhe's standing on principle. he's standing on things that we've never -- we watched eight years. i mean, i suffered in eight years watching the obama administration do things that are going to take us decades to get out of, but president trump, i do find it -- i don't know what the word that the media treats -- they hate his guts, obviously. they can't stand him.\n\nbut they never call him president trump. you ever notice that? they always call him donald trump. you never heard them say barack obama. it was president obama and it's just the little things. i don't get caught up in them, but it's just kind of funny how they do that.\n\nlevin: all right, ladies and gentlemen, don't forget, you can join us most weeknights on levin tv. give us a call at 844- levin-tv, 844-levin-tv or go to blazetv.com/mark, that's blazetv.com/mark. we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, as a broadcaster -- radio, tv, digital tv -- i actually find sports broadcasters to be even more liberal than the so- called mainstream media and they like to talk about politics all the time.\n\nfirst of all, why is that and why do they like to talk about politics all the time?\n\nschilling: i don't have an answer for why. i do know and i believe the number is 86, but it might be 88% -- they did a poll on sports writers and 88% of the people in the media -- in sports media are liberal.\n\nlevin: why is that?\n\nschilling: well, i think that it's a byproduct of our education system, first off. most of them have gone to college and got a degree in gender studies or whatever they get degrees in these days and that's what they do.\n\ni've got to tell you when i got -- when i realized that, when i was done playing and i looked back on that, i think about these guys that are -- they've got four-year degree from bu and they've got a journalism degree and they're standing in front of a kid who's 21 years old, doesn't speak english from the dominican and he's making $15 million a year and they're taking home, you know, $1,500.00 a month after tax or whatever and there was some bitterness. you can always see in the writing.\n\nlevin: so you think they're bitter because they see athletes making all this money and they make chump change -- many of them.\n\nschilling: i don't think that's the sole reason. i think that that's part of it. i've seen that dynamic at work, but i do know that -- i was surprised by that by what you said. there were a lot more liberals in the booth and espn was -- i mean, i had people literally come up to me. it's almost like being a member of the underground railway, i guess.\n\nthey would come up and say hey, listen i agree with your political views, so keep it up. like, no one can hear them say that and it turned out to be true. there were no -- almost no outwardly concert -- except for me at espn and they made that end pretty quickly, so ...\n\nlevin: could it also be in part, you see a lot of the athletes taking the knee, not all of them, a lot of them taking the knee. you see like at the nfl at the highest levels, they cave to the left and also conservatives don't use sports to make statements. you know, you just said, you're competitive, you're an athlete. you do your thing. you go home or you do your commercials or whatever you do.\n\ncould the problem be that for progressivism, witting or unwitting, whatever the format is, whatever the forum is. sports -- we're going to devour it with our ideology. that's my sense of this. whatever is out there, we have got to superimpose and project our ideology.\n\nschilling: and isn't that what they kind of do is as an -- they chew something up, spit it out move to the next thing. i'll give you a great example. christine blasey ford. when was the last time you heard her name?\n\nlevin: you're right. i haven't heard --\n\nschilling: i mean that -- but that was -- she was the linchpin of the trump administration's nomination of judge kavanaugh and it turned out she had nothing and it turned out that all the people involved including michael avenatti and the lady in newark, they were lying about this man.\n\nthey say they -- and lindsey graham was right. i think lindsey graham justified his political life in the statement he made at the end of that.\n\nlevin: that was his great ...\n\nschilling: that was.\n\nlevin: you know that was his great sort of welch speech.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: have you no decency?\n\nschilling: and i try to tell people, and i tell my kids, listen if the left will destroy a man like that to get what they want, nobody's off- limits. look at what they did to general flynn. this man served his country honorably for how long. he didn't know -- there was -- it wasn't a misleading --\n\nlevin: setup.\n\nschilling: right, he was set up and we're going to find out when the mueller stuff is all done that that -- if we can get the truth, it's going to be stunning.\n\nlevin: well one of the things we'll be able to get is in that chair, i hope general flynn, who will for once be able to tell his side of the story. people don't understand that when a prosecutor is holding a legal gun to your head, you're not allowed to speak ...\n\nschilling: and threatening your family.\n\nlevin: and threatening your son, threatening your family. they have enormous power and in this case, there's really no check and balance.\n\nschilling: insider power, yes.\n\nlevin: and as a matter of fact, congress, even republicans keep saying we need to protect the prosecutor. no, you need to protect his targets because there's no check and balance right now, he's got enormous power beyond any u.s. attorney.\n\nschilling: and when you think about the nsa and you think about google and all of the social media companies and their invasiveness into our lives, you know, they could go tomorrow and plant whatever they wanted on your computer.\n\nlevin: what do you make of the unmasking of general flynn, the unmasking of these individuals during the obama administration? why aren't we getting to the bottom of that? why aren't we getting to the bottom of that whole russia collusion?\n\nschilling: that's half the challenge. we ask questions we already know the answers to. we are talking about -- we know for a fact the president didn't collude in any fashion with russia, but hillary clinton gave somebody -- that is tied to a russian, you know, companies access the 20% of our uranium?\n\nlevin: she gave -- that's right, a state-controlled company and also it is she and the dnc that funneled money through a law firm and so forth to a foreign ex-spy who worked with the russians.\n\nschilling: and how is that not the story?\n\nlevin: isn't that amazing to you?\n\nschilling: it's more scary than amazing because it's again -- you know, in many -- i've told you this in many ways, the media can do whatever they want to if they don't like you. they can do whatever they want to if they do like you. they've managed to marginalize me in many ways for things i've never done, but when i think about it, like i said, if general flynn is not off-limits, if hillary clinton can give access to our uranium to the russians and not be held accountable, then the justice system is broken horribly.\n\nlevin: all right, we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, you read a lot of history you said. military history, in particular. you see what the president of the united states is trying to do with north korea. it's very, very difficult. he was handed a real bad hand there. he's accused of going soft on russia, yet he's tougher on russia than obama has ever been.\n\ni really like what he's doing with china, which has been stealing our technology and is expanding militarily in so many ways. i wish our media would focus on some of that and he's reversed the obama administration's policy vis a vis iran, which is a terrorist state that has killed american soldiers, which obviously is building icbms not for tel aviv, but for los angeles.\n\nbut they're grave threat is -- they are on a grave threat to us, too and yet he's not given a lot of credit for what he's doing in foreign policy, which is essentially reaganism and they attack reagan, too and reagan was very, very successful. what do you make of that?\n\nschilling: well the first thing, i think the most obvious issue for me is, i find it stunning that when the president of the united states says america first, people get offended. that's a dog whistle. now, when the left says dog whistle, america first. americans are black, white, yellow, brown, green -- i don't -- they're all colors, all races, all religions. america -- that's what makes us so great.\n\nbut that seems to offend everybody when he says america first. he is the first president --\n\nlevin: why does that offend the left?\n\nschilling: well i think because --\n\nlevin: do they view us as part of a global community?\n\nschilling: oh sure they do. well, you heard them. i mean, hillary wanted hemispherical borders.\n\nlevin: well is this why they don't, at this point now, they want open borders. they don't even talk about national sovereignty. would they actually have us surrender our form of representation to international organizations?\n\nschilling: yes, i think they would. first of all, you can't be a sovereign nation without borders. i mean that's just a simple fact. but i've got to tell you, on the foreign policy side, i think, i was struck by a couple of things.\n\nwhen he was running and he -- when he was interviewing people for his cabinet, he was talking about people for his joint chiefs and i can't remember the general's name. i want to say it was flynn, but it wasn't. it was somebody else. he said that he came away with an impression of president trump that he didn't go in with. he said, a lot of times i view people and their intelligence by the questions they ask rather than the questions they answer, and the questions he asked me were just brilliant, and you know, i'll take his word that they were that.\n\ni think he's getting advice from the people in -- his inner circle is smaller than any president in our lifetime.\n\nlevin: but i'll tell you, it's so solid with bolton and pompeo, and folks like that. if you don't believe in america first, what do you believe in? america second?\n\nschilling: if your foreign policy is not america first, what is it? china first? i mean, part of the reason i was so distraught over the eight years of obama is -- whoever was president this time, hopefully it was a conservative, he was going to have to unravel the kowtowing and the bending and the kissing of butt globally that the administration did, apologizing.\n\ni mean, our soldiers are buried on foreign territory all over the world and i don't know of any foreign soldiers that are buried on our ground that helped us get what we got now.\n\nlevin: some french --\n\nschilling: there are some french -- yes, there are some french, absolutely. absolutely, but when you go to the graveyard above normandy beach above utah beach and you look at the rows and the rows and the rows and you watch french citizens react to world war ii veterans which is one of the greatest things i've ever seen in my life, you realize that the media doesn't represent not just american interests but the common man.\n\nlevin: all right, we'll be right back\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: i want to circle back to where we began the program -- the hall of fame. for people who don't know, who decides who gets into the hall of fame?\n\nschilling: so there's a baseball writers association, a sports writers association, once you get ten years in, you're qualified to get a hall of fame ballot.\n\nlevin: so ten years in as a writer?\n\nschilling: yes, as a member of the association, so -- and you don't have to be a baseball writer.\n\nlevin: so you can be an expert on boxing.\n\nschilling: you could be an expert on anything, but baseball and some of the people that are on there have never watched baseball.\n\nlevin: how many of them are there in this group?\n\nschilling: i think there's a little over 400 now, this year.\n\nlevin: is that typical or is it normally 400?\n\nschilling: yes, it fluctuates. you lose -- if you don't vote, you lose your ballot and there's rules.\n\nlevin: so how does somebody get on the ballot?\n\nschilling: you have to play ten or more years in the big leagues and once you get that threshold, five years after you retire, you go on the ballot.\n\nlevin: but that means -- so you go on automatically?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: how do you qualify to go on there?\n\nschilling: you have to play ten years in --\n\nlevin: just by seniority?\n\nschilling: yes, by playing a specific amount of time, yes.\n\nlevin: so every baseball player who's played a certain period of time is on a ballot?\n\nschilling: yes, and what happens, if you get less than 5% votes, you're off the next year, which is what happens to the ballots.\n\nlevin: what's the highest percentage you ever got?\n\nschilling: fifty-something.\n\nlevin: you know when?\n\nschilling: i think two years ago because it went down last year.\n\nlevin: so you're like perennial. you keep popping up on their ballot.\n\nschilling: i do wonder how my percentage is. i haven't won a game or struck out a hitter in ten years and i apparently, i'm getting better and worse.\n\nlevin: do people tell you, writers tell you what's going on? they must talk to each other?\n\nschilling: so -- but i don't know, 15 years ago, i was in tampa bay and the hall of fame voting had come out and i think -- i want to say nolan ryan had gotten elected and a writer walked into the clubhouse and said -- and this guy was -- he was an ass. he was a pompous guy. he was the 500- pound guy who tells everybody he was the greatest athlete in the world when he wasn't 500 pounds.\n\nhe turned out to be a horrible human being. he came in and said, i didn't vote for a nolan ryan. proud and i said, what do you mean you didn't vote for nolan ryan? he said, no, if don sutton didn't get in unanimously, nolan ryan doesn't deserve. and he wrote a huge article on it.\n\nand i said, so you didn't vote for nolan ryan so you could get content because you're too lazy to go out and get it yourself. and you realized that this is -- you're being asked to pass judgment on a career you have no business giving comment on, but anyway.\n\ni realized that it was a good lesson because i learned early in my life that they don't vote their conscience. they vote a --\n\nlevin: there are a lot of other reasons.\n\nschilling: right, but for a lot of other thing.\n\nlevin: i want to ask you this, i don't want the public to know this. you haven't complained about this to me at all. i'm the one who keeps bringing it up.\n\nschilling: i never will.\n\nlevin: let me ask you this. in your mind, who are the three greatest pitchers in modern baseball history?\n\nschilling: greg maddux is the best pitcher in the history of the game.\n\nlevin: why?\n\nschilling: because what he did when he did it belies logic. i think randy johnson, probably the greatest --\n\nlevin: and you played with him?\n\nschilling: yes. probably the greatest power pitcher.\n\nlevin: let me tell you, if i were standing at the plate and this guy's up there, what was he? six nine or something? and his arm's speed, i mean he's like 30 feet --\n\nschilling: he basically almost brushes your nose when he lets go of the baseball.\n\nlevin: i'd be scared to death.\n\nschilling: you should be because he flexes --\n\nlevin: quasi sidearm, i go, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nschilling: yes, he's throwing a hundred miles an hour.\n\nlevin: i know and that's a big dude.\n\nschilling: i got to watch that.\n\nlevin: yes.\n\nschilling: honored to watch that and i think pedro martinez had one of the greatest runs ever. what he did before that three-year period was -- but i would say maddux and johnson and there's clemens before he did the stuff he did.\n\nlevin: what about ryan?\n\nschilling: i think nolan ryan was one of the greatest strikeout pitchers of all time. nolan ryan was a guy -- his last pitch was 95 miles an hour.\n\nlevin: i mean, that's unbelievable.\n\nschilling: he was like 79 years old when he threw that.\n\nlevin: yes, i mean -- i would consider him one of the greats.\n\nschilling: yes, i -- yes, okay, that's fair.\n\nlevin: i also consider you one of the greatest.\n\nschilling: well, i appreciate that.\n\nlevin: i mean, there's nobody better in the postseason -- nobody.\n\nschilling: i had two goals when i said -- i'll never and -- i honest to god, my wife and i were laying in bed in 1992, right after my first season in the big leagues and she said to me, you know, what do you want to happen? i said, i want two things. i want to win the roberto clemente award, which is -- because roberto clemente is my dad's favorite player and i want to retire having all of the teammates that wore my jersey say, if i had a game to pitch, win or lose, life or death, i would want him on the mound.\n\nin 2001, i won the roberto clemente award which is still the highlight of my career. a quick story, my dad, i went to one game as a fan in my lifetime -- in my lifetime. it was roberto clemente's final game in 1972. he doubled off john madden like for his 3,000th hit and he died in the plane crash not long after.\n\nthe first time i ever saw my dad cry, but that -- that he meant the world to my dad, so he meant the world to me and i got to meet the clemente family, which was the greatest thrill of my life.\n\nlevin: you're fascinating.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: and i want to thank you for coming on the program.\n\nschilling: it's a pleasure. it's always a pleasure.\n\nlevin: god bless you.\n\nschilling: god bless you.\n\nlevin: all right, ladies and gentlemen see you next time on life, liberty & levin.\n\ncontent and programming copyright 2019 fox news network, llc. all rights

president biden told reporters thursday that coronavirus relief will be passed with or without the support of congressional republicans.\n\nwhen asked if the president supports democrats' calls to use a legislative process known as budget reconciliation to get another stimulus package expedited through congress, biden said, i support passing it with support from republicans if we can get it.\n\nbut the relief has to pass, he added. no ifs and or buts.\n\nspeaker of the house nancy pelosi, d-calif., announced thursday, that the house will bring a budget resolution to the floor next week for biden's $1.9 trillion relief package – the first step in advancing a bill through the reconciliation process.\n\nthe senate will then vote to adopt the resolution. budget reconciliations require only a simple majority to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes needed for most legislation. democrats hold a majoriy in the house. the senate is even, but democrats have an effective majority because vice president kamala harris has the tie-breaking vote.\n\nbut the $1.9 trillion resolution is unlikely to garner much republican support, as several gop lawmakers have already voiced concern over the large price tag and ardently opposed increasing the previous amount allotted to individual stimulus checks -- even after president trump called on them to do so.\n\ni hope we don't need it, but if needed we will have it, pelosi told reporters thursday. we want it to be bipartisan always, but we can't surrender.\n\nbiden urged by house dems to extend obamacare benefits to daca recipients\n\nsenate majority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., reiterated pelosi's calls for a bipartisan bill but said it will be passed without republican lawmakers if they oppose the legislation.\n\nour preference is to make this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions from our republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same. but if our republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them, schumer said on the senate floor thursday.
self-described socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont, who says he will launch a political revolution if elected president in november, has made his radical medicare-for-all proposal the centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, who is challenging sanders for the democratic presidential nomination, argues correctly that medicare-for-all is unaffordable.\n\nbiden wants you to think he's a moderate who favors a much less costly plan that would build on obamacare. but the former vice president's plan still features its fair share of tax increases that would hamstring our economy and take a bite out of the average family's wallet.\n\nbetsy mccaughey: sanders gets it wrong on 'medicare-for-all'\n\nin truth, biden and sanders are both calling for the same thing – a government takeover of health insurance. they just differ on how to deliver that outcome.\n\nonce one of these men wins the democratic nomination to run against president trump, the president will call attention to the fatal flaws in his opponent's plans. as a result, that could mean that health care will become a losing issue for democrats, unlike in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nthe coronavirus was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on super tuesday. over half of voters in five states, including california and texas, said the illness caused by the virus was an important factor shaping their vote, according to exit polls.\n\nlikely because of their fears about the virus, voters in every super tuesday state listed health care as their most important issue. but they appeared to trust biden's pitch for incremental reform more than sanders' promise to burn down the status quo.\n\nnearly 40 percent of voters who said health care was their top issue voted for biden, while just 30 percent of those voters went to sanders.\n\nand yet, medicare-for-all remains popular with voters. exit polls from super tuesday found that half of all voters supported replacing private health insurance with a government-run system. around 70 percent of voters in maine and vermont supported this plan.\n\nthis public support for medicare-for-all might be a function of their fuzziness on how it would work. some 47 percent of americans erroneously think they'd be able to keep their employer-sponsored insurance under medicare-for-all.\n\nnearly six in 10 americans say they oppose medicare-for-all if it leads to the elimination of private insurance – which it most certainly does.\n\nmedicare-for-all may play well in the democratic primaries. but it will be disastrous in a general election.\n\nsanders' medicare-for-all plan will require back-breaking tax hikes that will pick the pockets of every american to cover its $46 trillion cost over 10 years. by way of comparison, president trump has proposed a budget of $4.829 trillion for the entire federal government in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nevidence from single-payer systems abroad indicates that all the gigantic tax increases needed to pay for medicare-for-all would simply buy us all places on waiting lists for health care.\n\nbiden promises to preserve private insurance and create a public option as a means of stoking competition in the insurance market. that may seem like a safer political bet for democrats who need the votes of suburban moderates to retake the white house.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nbut the public option is just single-payer in slow motion. it envisions paying doctors and hospitals rates similar to medicare's, which are about 40 percent less than those for private insurance.\n\nprivate insurers don't have the power to dictate what they'll pay providers. consequently, the public option will have a much lower cost structure – and will thus be able to set premiums that are far lower than those for private insurers.\n\nconsumers are sure to flock to the cheaper public plan. health care providers will respond by raising their rates for private insurers, who will have to pass those cost increases along to their customers in the form of higher premiums. that will drive still more people to the public option. the cycle would repeat, until the public option was the only insurance option left.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\njust two years ago, democrats chalked their victories in the 2018 midterm elections up to their promise to protect obamacare. now they're going to run on a plan for health care reform that results in the end of private insurance.\n\nthat's unlikely to play well at the polls in november, when there are more than democratic primary voters casting their ballots.\n\nclick here to read more by sally pipes
despite mountains of historical evidence revealing the dangers associated with socialism, support for karl marx's collectivist ideas is steadily increasing.\n\nin an august 2018 gallup poll, 51 percent of young people aged 18-29 said they have a favorable opinion of socialism, compared to just 45 percent who said they view capitalism positively. compare that to 2010, when 68 percent of young people said they view capitalism favorably. that's a remarkable 33 percent decline in just eight years.\n\nmany parents who support the traditional american values of self-responsibility, individual liberty and free markets, have been left to wonder how they can teach their children the truth about collectivism and resist the rise of socialism.\n\nbelow are strategies for talking to young people about the dangers of communism, socialism and other progressive ideas.\n\ndemocrats now pushing many of the same socialist policies that destroyed venezuela\n\nexplain the meaning of socialism and why it's immoral\n\nevery conversation about socialism should begin with a discussion about what it actually entails. survey data show most americans have no clue what socialism is, despite the fact that it's regularly discussed in the media.\n\nsocialism is the collective ownership and management of property. in a purely socialist society – an idea karl marx called communism – all or nearly all property is owned and managed by the collective.\n\nunder such a scheme, people have very little power over their own lives. even their homes are owned collectively. in the case of democratic socialism, this means that people are forced to live according to the desires of the majority. in many situations, a small group of people is given power by the majority, and that group typically ends up becoming tyrannical, as we've seen in china, north korea and venezuela.\n\nwith this model in place, minorities don't really have any rights. if the majority thinks people should live or work in a certain way, everyone is required to obey, even if it violates their deeply held beliefs. for example, in a socialist country, vegetarians would be required to be part owners in a slaughterhouse.\n\nin socialism, individual rights are mere illusions. even free-speech rights are limited if they are deemed harmful to the rest of society – which means these rights don't really exist at all. this is why human rights abuses are so common in countries that try to enact socialism.\n\nemphasize charity, not government coercion\n\nfor most young americans, socialist ideas are appealing because they genuinely want to help those who are suffering. they believe single-payer health care, a green new deal, and other similar policies are compassionate. conservatives have a tendency to dismiss these ideas without providing alternatives. this leaves younger people feeling frustrated.\n\ngovernment social programs might not be perfect, young liberals and socialists often tell me, but at least liberals and socialists are trying to fix difficult problems like poverty. conservatives and libertarians don't care what happens to people who are suffering.\n\nwhenever parents discuss socialism, they should always explain that it's important to engage in charitable activities. advocates of freedom do support helping others, they just don't believe the government is best equipped to do it.\n\nthis idea is best reinforced when families engage in charitable activities together. parents must show their kids that motivated, compassionate conservatives care for those most in need and make the world a better place.\n\nthis conversation allows parents to make a very important moral argument: charity is morally positive, because it means people are voluntarily helping those in need, but government welfare programs – however well-intentioned they might be – are not forms of charity. they require the government to use force and coercion. those who don't want to pay for a government program because they think it isn't helpful – or perhaps believe it's harmful – are forced to pay their taxes and participate anyway. those who refuse can end up in prison.\n\nor, put simply, conservatives support people freely helping others, while those on the left advocate for forcing, manipulating and controlling people to accomplish their goals.\n\nexplain that there's never been a successful socialist nation in world history\n\nhere's a startling fact about socialism that every child should hear: during the past century, tens of millions of people have been killed, exiled or imprisoned by socialist and communist parties, and no country has ever successfully enacted a system that matches marx's vision for the world – a reality even the staunchest marxist will admit.\n\nkids often respond to this fact by saying that there are many examples of socialism working successfully. like sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., they point to denmark, norway and sweden.\n\nthe idea that nordic nations are little socialist utopias is a gigantic myth. denmark, norway and sweden are absolutely not socialist nations. some parts of their economies have been socialized, like health care and higher education, but they are still market-based economies, and in many respects, their citizens are freer than americans.\n\nfor example, in the heritage foundation's 2019 index of economic freedom, denmark, norway and sweden all score higher than the united states in numerous categories, including property rights and business freedom.\n\nfurthermore, history has repeatedly shown that government can't fix many of our most complex societal issues, even when it socializes just one part of the economy. for example, since the obamacare health insurance exchanges first opened, insurance premiums have doubled and deductibles have skyrocketed.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ntalking about the dangers of socialism with kids isn't easy. children are constantly being bombarded with pro-socialist messages from hollywood, the music industry, professional sports and, most importantly, their teachers and professors.\n\nbut if parents aren't willing to put in the time to address these important ideas, who will?\n\nclick here to read more by justin haskins
now that the obamacare exchange websites are largely up and running, federal health officials are finding themselves swamped as they fact-check a flood of paperwork from applicants seeking taxpayer subsidies.\n\nthe department of health and human services seems to be caught between critics on both sides as it confronts the task.\n\nthe department, which oversees the implementation of the affordable care act, has gotten hit by audits showing it hasn't done enough to crack down on fraudsters trying to scam the system. at the same time, some frustrated applicants say they have played by the rules -- signed up on time and submitted the necessary paperwork -- only to be caught up in bureaucratic red tape.\n\nwe are working with consumers every day to make sure individuals and families get the tax credits and coverage they deserve and that no one received a benefit they shouldn't, hhs spokesman ben wakana told foxnews.com.\n\nhhs has been busy tracking down hundreds of thousands of americans who bought subsidized coverage through the aca's insurance exchanges.\n\nin most cases, hhs wants applicants to prove their citizenship, employer and income. those who are found ineligible could end up paying for their premiums without subsidy support, and those who already benefited from subsidies may be forced to repay some or all of the money.\n\nabout 8 million people signed up for a health plan through the aca exchanges -- according to hhs, that meant officials had to verify more than 160 million individual pieces of information. in the end, they found 1.2 million people had inconsistencies in their applications.\n\nthe agency, gradually, is getting through the pile. hhs tells foxnews.com that as of mid-july, they've processed 650,000 cases – and have about 550,000 left to go.\n\naccording to the kaiser family foundation, 85 percent of those who applied were considered eligible for some type of financial aid, which comes out to about $10 billion in subsidies in the first year.\n\nthe scramble to verify eligibility comes on the heels of a government accountability office report that raised fresh doubt about the ability of the health care program to prevent or intercept costly fraud schemes.\n\ngovernment investigators posing as fake applicants were able to go online, purchase health plans using fake documents and set themselves up to receive undeserved federal subsidies.\n\neleven of the 12 fictitious applicants were able to dupe the system using invalid social security numbers as well as inaccurate citizenship information, according to the report. the 11 were given the go-ahead to receive $30,000-a-year in health care credits and subsidies.\n\nfor its part, hhs says it is working to identify additional strategies to strengthen its verification process while getting credits to those who qualify.\n\nbut there's also the risk of putting in so many checks that applicants, like luis martinez of hialeah, fla, get caught in bureaucratic red tape.\n\nmartinez, who has heart problems, says he's been trying for more than a month to work out his document drama.\n\nhe bought a bronze-level health plan with coventry and was asked to provide additional information to verify his income and his wife's citizenship. his monthly $457 subsidy was at risk if he didn't comply.\n\nmartinez told the miami herald he tried multiple times to contact the government. he reportedly has receipts showing he mailed five identical packets of information to the hhs that contained copies of his u.s. passport, his wife's residency card, their joint 2013 income tax statement and his florida driver's license, the paper reported.\n\nfour weeks after he mailed his first packet, he received a letter asking for even more documents to verify his wife's immigration status.\n\nmartinez, who was hospitalized while waiting for the insurance issues to sort out, fears he could be stuck with a $12,000 medical bill for his stay.\n\nbut experts say that's unlikely. under the aca, consumers who have discrepancies with their application have 90 days to resolve the issue with documents that establish their eligibility.\n\nto qualify for a subsidized health plan under the affordable care act, government officials must verify a consumer's: social security number, citizen or immigration status, incarceration status, annual income, household size, medicaid eligibility, availability of employer-sponsored coverage and membership in a federally-recognized tribe.\n\nconsumers need to work with us in good faith to provide additional information that supports their application for coverage and we are working through these cases expeditiously, wakana said.
somersworth, n.h. -- former vice president joe biden cranked up the volume wednesday in his attacks against two of his top rivals for the democratic presidential nomination – sen. bernie sanders of vermont and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.\n\nspeaking to an audience in this small southeastern new hampshire city the morning after delayed partial returns from the iowa caucuses showed biden in fourth place -- trailing buttigieg, sanders and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts -- the former vice president admitted, i'm not going to sugarcoat it. we took a gut punch in iowa.\n\npick your poll: sanders is up in new hampshire or he's tied with biden\n\nbiden acknowledged that this is not the first time in my life i've been knocked down.\n\nbut he vowed that we are going to come back and pledged that i'm going to fight for this nomination. i'm going to fight for it here in new hampshire, and in nevada and then in south carolina and beyond.\n\nbiden's lackluster performance in the iowa caucuses makes a strong finish in next week's primary in new hampshire even more imperative.\n\nwith that in mind, biden then unloaded on sanders, warning that if senator sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in america up and down the ballot – blue states, red states, purple states, easy districts competitive ones – every democrat will have to carry the label that senator sanders has chosen for himself.\n\nhe then stressed that sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.\n\nthe former vice president then emphasized that president trump is champing at the bit to label the democrats as socialists. and he pointed to his own efforts in the 2018 midterms in helping the democrats win back the majority of the house of representatives.\n\nwhen sanders attacks me for having baggage, i have to tell you the 60-plus candidates that i campaigned for, the toughest districts in the country just two years ago, don't see me as baggage and they wanted me in their districts, he said.\n\nand biden said he doubted such candidates would want bernie sanders to come in and campaign for them.\n\nbiden then used some of his most muscular language to date to criticize buttigieg, who's narrowly leading sanders in iowa as the results trickle in.\n\nbiden said: mayor pete likes to attack me as well and he's a good man. he calls me part of the old failed washington. really. was it a failure that i went to congress to get obamacare passed?\n\nbiden then highlighted numerous other accomplishments during the obama years and asked is he really saying that the obama-biden administration was a failure? pete, just say it out loud.\n\nbiden's campaign quickly blasted his comments on twitter.\n\nthe former vice president then took another shot, saying i've great respect for mayor pete and his service to this nation but i believe it's a risk – to be straight up with you – for this party to nominate someone who's never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 in indiana. i do believe it's a risk.\n\nrep. annie kuster (nh02) - who endorsed buttigieg last month - pushed back.\n\nthe only lawmaker in new hampshire's four-member all democratic congressional delegation said have tremendous respect for the vice president. but i've got to tell you, it's a risk to go after this campaign with the same message, the same ideas, the same issues that we've been litigating. i think we need new energy, i think we need a new approach ... bringing people together the way pete does.\n\nat the event in somersworth, biden was interrupted twice by climate change demonstrators.\n\nthese guys are ok, biden said as the protesters chanted. they want to do the same thing i want to do. they want to phase out fossil fuels and we're going to phase out fossil fuels.\n\nwhen one of them continued to interupt biden, he responded saying don't act like the trumpers, ok.\n\nmoments later another of the protesters - a young woman - asked what biden would do to close a coal fired plan in new hampshire.\n\nthe former vice president touted his past efforts and added we can't do it all at one. we're working on it kid. we're working on it.
with wednesday's presidential primary debate in nevada fast approaching, mike bloomberg remains one poll shy of making the state.\n\nbut, his campaign on monday confirmed to fox news that if he were to qualify, the former new york city mayor and billionaire business and media mogul will take part in the primetime showdown.\n\nbloomberg's reached 10 percent or higher in three national polls that the democratic national committee has approved. he would need one more to make the stage, and would have until 11:59 p.m. et tuesday night to get that poll.\n\na new national poll by the marist institute for public opinion for npr and pbs newshour is scheduled to be released at 5 a.m. et on tuesday. the survey is one of the dnc's qualifying polls.\n\nthe two other ways to make the stage – reaching 12 percent or higher in two nevada caucus or south carolina primary-approved polls, or winning a delegate to the national convention in the feb. 3 iowa caucuses or last week's new hampshire primary – have been out of picture for bloomberg, since he's not on the ballot in any of the early-voting states.\n\nso far, sens. bernie sanders of vermont, amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts, former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg and former vice president joe biden have made the stage.\n\nbut, the other billionaire in the race – environmental and progressive advocate tom steyer – has failed to qualify. he has remained three national polls shy – or two nevada or south carolina polls short – of making the stage. and, rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii has been even further from meeting the thresholds.\n\nearlier this month, the dnc scrapped the individual donor threshold for candidates to qualify for the debate. since bloomberg has been self-funding his white house bid, he essentially had been shutout from making the stage. the move by the dnc – which opened the door to bloomberg – sparked criticism from many of his rivals.\n\nbloomberg decided even before he launched his bid in late november to skip the early voting states of iowa, new hampshire, nevada and south carolina and instead invest hundreds of millions of his own money to compete in the delegate-rich super tuesday states holding contests on march 3 – and beyond.\n\neven though he's not on the ballot in nevada, being on the debate stage could benefit bloomberg – with super tuesday less than two weeks away.\n\nas he's risen in national polls the past couple of weeks and as onetime-unrivaled front-runner biden has slipped – bloomberg's come under increased fire from his rivals as well as president trump's re-campaign over past controversial comments in support of the stop-and-frisk policing he once oversaw during his tenure as new york city mayor. and, he's also taken hits as more and more past remarks deemed sexist have been unearthed.\n\nthat's led some political pundits to surmise that bloomberg would be better off if he failed to qualify for wednesday's debate – thus avoiding direct contact with his rivals.\n\none longtime consultant for the democrats, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, also pointed to bloomberg's lack of charisma.\n\nbloomberg would be best served if he didn't appear on the debate stage before super tuesday, because voters won't see his bland personality and slow-to-respond debate reflexes, the strategist noted.\n\nbloomberg - regardless of whether he qualifies for the debate or not - is scheduled to in neighboring utah on thursday evening - to hold a rally in salt lake city.\n\nno letup in the bloomberg-sanders war of words\n\nsanders – in front of a crowd his campaign estimated was over 10,000 people at the rosie the riveter wwii home front national historical park in richmond, calif., once again blasted bloomberg.\n\nmr. bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president, sanders said. but, the populist senator who's making his second straight white house run emphasized, he does not have a right to buy the presidency, especially after being mayor of new york and having a racist stop-and-frisk policy.\n\nhours earlier, bloomberg's campaign touted a new digital ad hitting sanders supporters over some of their recent controversial rhetoric. the spot featured texts, tweets, and memes from people who appeared to be sanders supporters attacking rivals for the nomination.\n\nbloomberg – in a tweet spotlighting the ad – wrote, we need to unite to defeat trump in november. this type of 'energy' is not going to get us there.\n\nbilingual campaigning\n\nspanish-speaking voters have played an extremely influential role in nevada's presidential caucuses, and the democrats' campaigns have been stepping up their efforts to reach the electorate, with early caucus voting underway since saturday.\n\none of the latest examples: warren's campaign on monday announced latinas fight, latinas win – or latinas en la lucha – to highlight the senator's commitment to reach out to the community.\n\nand, the klobuchar campaign joined rivals in going up over the weekend with spanish-language tv and radio ads.\n\npro-biden super pac plants flag in nevada\n\nthe pro-joe biden super pac unite the country told fox news it will spend $750,000 to run ads this week in nevada in support of the former vice president.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthe group said the spots will focus on obamacare and gun control, and will run thru saturday's caucuses.\n\nunite the country spent heavily in iowa (approx. $5 million) and new hampshire (where the group spent roughly $900,000 to run ads) on behalf of biden.\n\nfox news' kelly phares, tara prindiville, alex rego and andrew craft contributed to this report.
the u.s. supreme court announced monday that it will review a challenge to the affordable care act's constitutionality after a group of states led by texas claimed that there is no longer a legal justification for it.\n\nthe law, commonly known as obamacare, was first upheld by the supreme court under the justification that by tying the individual mandate -- the requirement to buy health insurance -- to a financial penalty it fell under congress' taxation power. when president trump eliminated the penalty, republican-led states claimed there was no longer a legal basis for the mandate.\n\nobamacare under fire: lawsuit, tax repeals and 'medicare-for-all' push leave aca fate unclear\n\nthe fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in december that part of the law is now unconstitutional and their decision cast a cloud over the rest.\n\nthe individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the ruling said. the court sent the case back down to a lower court to decide on whether the mandate is severable from the rest of the law, which would allow other parts of obamacare to survive.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\na group of 20 democratic states appealed. defenders of the affordable care act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts.\n\na decision from the supreme court is not expected until after the 2020 election.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report.
