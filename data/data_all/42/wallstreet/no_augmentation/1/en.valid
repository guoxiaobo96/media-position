retirement savers can contribute $18,500 in a 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the thrift savings plan in 2018, up $500 from last year. for people 50 and older, the additional catch-up contribution limit is unchanged at $6,000 more.
other important facts to know, according to the internal revenue service:
contributions, also known as deferrals, as well as employer matches and discretionary contributions or allocations of forfeitures to your accounts, should be the lesser of either 100% of your compensation level or $55,000 in 2018 (or $61,000 with catch-up contributions).
when it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s
employers may offer automatic enrollment or automatic increases to 401(k) plan contributions. the former takes money out of an employee's pay before tax and automatically places it into a 401(k) (usually around 3%), which qualify as elective deferrals. employees can opt out of this, though it does ensure there's some money saved for retirement and has helped savers stash away maybe $29.6 billion for retirement.
401(k) plan requirements cannot require employees work more than a year at the company, though some companies may have to wait until they're eligible for matching contributions and others may have vesting requirements, which means you have to work a specific number of years before those matched contributions are completely yours.
if an employee over-saves in a 401(k) plan, they have to act fast. excess deferrals as well as any money earned from those extra dollars must be refunded by april 15 so that it is reported as regular income. if done after tax day, late distributions are subject to extra taxes and penalties. companies may automatically stop contributions once the maximum is reached, but not always, so savers should check their accounts.

401(k) plan contribution limits was the top query related to 401(k) plans on google at the end of 2017, according to google trends. here are some others:
there was talk of drastically changing 401(k) plans late last year, before the tax bill was passed. reports suggested the contribution limit would be dropped to $2,400 per year, or somewhere between there and the then-current limit of $18,000. others thought congress might rothify these accounts, by taxing contributions before investing them. traditional 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, which means they're taxed at withdrawal. the new tax bill ended up not including either of these ideas, but still affects retirement savers and retirees, such as stopping recharacterizations of individual retirement accounts (which allow savers to undo decisions to rollover or convert accounts to roth iras) or inspiring some to move to another state.
traditional 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored accounts that allow employees to save pre-tax dollars from their wages for retirement. a roth 401(k) is also employer-sponsored, but contributions are invested with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax (so long as you're 59 ½ years old and have had the account five years).
they have the same contribution limits as traditional 401(k) plans, though employees will see more taken out of their take-home pay because their wages will be taxed before a portion is invested into their retirement plan. to make the best decision, employees have to estimate what tax bracket they'll be in during retirement and assess what makes the most sense for them.

retirement savers cannot withdraw from their 401(k) plans before they turn 59 ½ years old (unless they become disabled or are separated from their employer after turning 55 years old). if distributions are made before 59 ½ years old, savers have to pay an additional 10% tax on the distribution (loans up to 50% of vested account balances are also allowed depending on the employer and plan, though they must be repaid within five years).
the money can't stay in the account forever, though. beginning april 1 of the calendar year in which the account holder reaches 70 ½ or retires (whichever comes later), retirement savers must start taking required minimum distributions.

a sudden, sharp decline by the yuan this week appeared to have far-reaching consequences for global equity markets, as indexes from asia to north america post serious losses.
for yuan traded in china's onshore market, it's been the largest period of decline since chinese officials surprised investors by announcing a surprise devaluation in mid-august. the decision had a similarly turbulent impact on global markets.
read: dow kicks off 2016 with 400-point plunge on china fears
many market strategists believe the august devaluation convinced the federal reserve to delay its first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.
now, with the dollar widely expected to continue rising as the fed raises rates this year, market strategists are waiting for the other shoe to drop. they're bracing for further devaluation of the yuan, and the global market turmoil they suspect might follow.
here are a couple of factors that might affect the yuan's valuation over the next 12 months.
late last year, chinese policy makers announced they would begin publishing the yuan's valuation relative to three new currency baskets, including one that was trade-weighted.
this led to speculation that china might soon announce another change in how it manages the yuan's exchange rate. instead of using the dollar as its sole reference, officials could begin using the trade-weighted basket to set the yuan's daily reference rate, market strategists speculated.
i think everybody's on alert that if the dollar rises substantially further, there's a good chance that [the pboc] would change the mechanism or let the [yuan] go, said greg anderson, global head of currency strategy at bmo capital markets.
read: why china may want its yuan to be more like the singapore dollar
such a change would likely help the yuan to gradually weaken, sparing investors from the global market turmoil that followed its sudden devaluation in august.
china's enormous current-account surplus increased in 2015 as falling commodity prices cheapened the total value of the raw materials imported by chinese manufacturers.
but in the second half of the year, its capital account—a measure of money moving into and out of an economy—actually turned negative, and its foreign currency reserve declined.
because the capital account reflects the flow of money across borders, it's likely that the yuan will continue to move in the same direction as the capital account, anderson said.
nicholas lardy, a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics, said the declines in both china's capital account and its foreign currency reserves have been driven by traders quickly unwinding bets that the yuan would continue to strengthen, following the yuan's august devaluation.
the question that's the most interesting is: what share, roughly speaking, of the carry trades that were in place last summer have now been unwound?, lardy said.
onshore yuan usdcny, +0.03% finished monday's session at 6.53 to the dollar, while its offshore cnycnh, +0.23% counterpart traded at 6.76. it was at 6.49, and 6.77 a session earlier, according to data from factset.
it's very likely that if the dollar continues to strengthen, chinese policy makers will take steps to drive their currency lower, though the people's bank of china prefers to gradually implement policy changes.
but it isn't just policy makers who want a weaker currency; yuan traders also believe the currency is overvalued at the onshore rate.
proof of this can be seen in the gap between the yuan's onshore and offshore exchange rates, which has seldom been wider than it is right now, as the chart below illustrates.
as they prepare for the yuan's inclusion in the international monetary fund's special drawing rights basket, traders and market strategists expect chinese policy makers to loosen their grip on the currency. many hope that someday the onshore rate will be eliminated as controls on the currency are abandoned.
especially in light of the discouraging data released over the past week, allowing the onshore rate to move closer to its offshore sibling might help boost growth in the country's slowing economy.
the congressional budget office estimated tuesday that the federal government would run a budget deficit of $559 billion in fiscal 2017, slightly smaller than an earlier projection.
in its latest budget and economic outlook, the cbo said the new estimate was due to its expectation that mandatory spending would be lower than earlier anticipated.
the market bears just keep winning in the new year.
the s&p 500 has slumped into correction territory, and chinese stocks today briefly traded in bear-market territory. zerohedge is gleefully reporting that a legendary j.p. morgan quant sees the beleaguered s&p spx, -0.20% getting more grizzly. that's using the common definitions for correction and bear territory — drops of 10% and 20%, respectively, from closing highs.
any silver lining in these dark clouds? well, at least analysts are getting a bit more creative in their finger-pointing after each market dive. sure, they're still blaming china's economic slowdown and crude oil's crash, but u.s. consumer-discretionary stocks are now key culprits. yes, we're looking at you, netflix nflx, -2.16% and borgwarner bwa, -0.46% .

accuvest's garff says his shop's investing strategy is to search each month for countries that provide the best opportunities in global markets going forward.
in their latest look-see, china has moved up to fourth-best nation, and investors therefore should overweight that country, according to accuvest's model. that model looks at four factors: fundamentals (earnings and economic growth), momentum (relative strength), risk and valuation (relative and absolute).
we want to be as dispassionate as possible, and not be swayed by market commentary and sentiment, garff told marketwatch in an email. as always, our views could change next month, but for the moment, we continue to like china.
he acknowledges the many good reasons for steering clear of china, including suspect data from the government and listed companies, as well as beijing's various missteps as it manages its economy and financial markets. but accuvest's president and chief investment officer argues the u.s. has similar issues with data, while a growing middle class and other demographics are on beijing's side as the economy slows and changes.

waiters and waitresses could take home significantly less money if a new rule proposed by the trump administration in december passes, critics say.
changes proposed by the department of labor on dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. the change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. after the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.
that sounds like a fair plan, in theory.
however, there is no guarantee employers would redistribute pooled tips, and critics say economic models show they will likely pocket them instead. if this proposed rule were finalized, restaurant owners could pocket between $523 million and $14.2 billion — with $5.8 billion being the best estimate — in tips earned by tipped workers each year, according to economic policy institute economists heidi shierholz, david cooper, julia wolfe, and ben zipperer.
and nearly 80% of the tips that would be taken from employees would come out of the pockets of female tipped workers, according to the economic policy institute. an economic analysis showing these negative effects of the change was scrubbed by the department of labor, a new report from the economic policy institute reported, showing the lengths to which the trump administration ... will go to hide the fact that they are taking steps to actively make workers' lives worse, it said. (the department of labor did not respond to request for comment.)
the big lie is that it will lead to restaurants sharing these tips with back of house, said shierholz, senior economist and director policy at the economic policy institute. instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. the proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (a spokesman for the department of labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)
the moneyist: how to deal with a stingy friend
the economic policy institute said the department of labor did not provide estimates of the number of tips that would be shifted from employers to employees under the new ruling. the department of labor previously said the rule is out to comment and that stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.
however, 12% of tipped workers had tips stolen by their employer or supervisor, according to a 2009 study from center for urban economic development, often leading to minimum wage violations. the ruling would also disproportionately affect non-white employees: white non-hispanic tipped workers would lose $3.5 billion, hispanic workers would lose $1.4 billion, black non-hispanic tipped workers would lose $486 million, asian workers would lose $391 million, and tipped workers who are of another race would lose $104 million, according to the economic policy institute.
some restaurant workers say the department of labor changes are sorely needed as restaurants struggle to pay back-of-house workers like kitchen porters fairly in an industry with notoriously tight profit margins. in order for back-of-house workers to receive annual increases, tip credit needs to remain in place, said joshua chaisson, a server in portland, maine who has been involved in a grassroots campaign to undo similar legislation. restaurants can then focus on increasing hourly wages, he said.
by his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers — an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants. this rise in wages for servers has led to more restaurants closing and fewer jobs for people in the service industry, chaisson argues.
but the epi's analysis suggested bigger profits would likely not be redistributed among workers, but rather go into the pockets of owners. to truly help back-of-house, low-income workers, wages need to be increased and employers should not be allowed to take tips, she added. there is far more incentive for them to pocket that money than to give it to employees, she said.
the proposed rule is up for public comment until feb. 3. a spokesperson for the department said stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.
merck & co. inc. shares surged 5.8% in extremely heavy trade tuesday after the company announced that its key cancer drug keytruda had positive results in a late-stage clinical trial for advanced lung cancer.
keytruda has already been approved for this indication, last year. but the latest results should support the food and drug administration's decision and pose a setback for competitors roche rhhby, -1.56% and bristol-myers squibb co. bmy, +0.24% .
they also support the company's mrk, -0.04% move to change the design of the phase 3 trial last fall, despite pushback from wall street, cancer research expert brad loncar said.
merck's recent results are actually about as big as it gets, loncar, who manages the loncar cancer immunotherapy exchange-traded fund cncr, -1.56% , said, describing it as a happy ending for the company as well as patients.
related: how a merck cancer breakthrough caused bristol-myers' stock to plunge
in the phase 3 trial, patients on keytruda plus chemotherapy performed better on two measures of a cancer therapy's success, progression-free survival and overall survival, than the chemotherapies did alone.
those are especially important results because the trial was initially only supposed to look at progression-free survival, which measures how long it takes before a patient's cancer worsens.
but last fall, merck added overall survival, which measures how much longer patients on a therapy live, as another primary endpoint.
wall street saw it then as a suggestion that merck wasn't confident in its product, as well as a timeline for results that was at least a year longer, loncar said.
merck shares fell 6% two days in a row in late october alongside a third-quarter sales miss and news of a major cyberattack.
merck plans to release more detailed results from the phase 3 trial at a coming medical meeting, and will submit them to regulators as well. (keytruda has not been approved in this indication in europe; merck withdrew its application there in late october.)

keytruda has grown to become a top product by revenue for merck in recent years, going from a mere $55 million in sales in 2014 to $1.4 billion by 2016.
sales are expected to grow to a projected $9 billion globally by 2026, according to an estimate by pharmaceutical and biomedical industry analyst firm informa pharma intelligence.
related: merck earnings buoyed by cancer-drug sales
the latest results could prove an important foundation for that growth. smoking, which causes many lung cancer cases, has made advanced lung cancer a big market for pharmaceutical companies.
the competition has also been fierce.
shares of roche, which recently presented data in this area, dropped nearly 4% and shares of bristol-myers squibb, which has the next big trial readout, dropped nearly 5% on tuesday after merck's results.
it doesn't look like roche will be very competitive, loncar told marketwatch, adding, the next company that has a fighting chance is going to be bristol, but it's going to be a tall order after today, for sure.
president trump has said american workers have been front and center of his campaign and his presidency. the agenda i will layout this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda, it's the agenda of the american people. many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers, the president said in his state of the union speech on feb. 5

the u.s. gained 304,000 new jobs in january, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. the unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.
under a host of new laws that will go into effect in 2019, however, states are taking it upon themselves to change employees' lives, from how much they earn, to their comfort and security in the workplace, to their ability to plan for their futures.
a handful of states have increased the minimum wage to between $12 and $15, and others have implemented regulations that focus on preventing sexual harassment, saving for retirement and fostering a more gender-diverse work environment.

here are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:
nineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in january, with many raising it to $15 an hour. another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the national employment law project.
states that increased minimum wage at the beginning of the year include: alaska, arizona, arkansas, california, colorado, delaware, florida, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, missouri, montana, new jersey, new york, ohio, rhode island, south dakota, vermont and washington.

cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like texas and florida, sonn said. this will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.

no perks for some fired government workers
illinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. as part of senate bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. it also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. the law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.

california has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.

a retirement crisis is looming in the country. americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. states have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.
california's program, called calsavers, will open to all eligible workers this july. oregon was the first state to implement its state-sponsored retirement program, and illinois has also started its own program. more states are expected to implement or propose similar legislation in the coming years.
london (ap) — britain's long and sometimes acrimonious divorce from the european union ended thursday with an economic split that leaves the eu smaller and the u.k. freer but more isolated in a turbulent world.
britain left the european bloc's vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. london time, midnight in brussels, completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since world war ii. a different u.k.-eu trade deal will bring new restrictions and red tape, but for british brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the eu and its web of rules.
prime minister boris johnson, whose support for brexit helped push the country out of the eu, called it an amazing moment for this country.
britons and eu citizens have lost the automatic right to live and work in the other's territory, while tourists face new headaches.
we have our freedom in our hands, and it is up to us to make the most of it, he said in a new year's video message.
the break comes 11 months after a political brexit that left the two sides in the limbo of a transition period — like a separated couple still living together, wrangling and wondering whether they can remain friends. now the u.k. has finally moved out.
it was a day some had longed for and others dreaded since britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the eu, but it turned out to be something of an anticlimax. u.k. lockdown measures to curb the coronavirus curtailed mass gatherings to celebrate or mourn the moment, though a handful of brexit supporters defied the restrictions to raise a toast outside parliament as the big ben bell sounded 11 times on the hour.
a free trade agreement sealed on christmas eve after months of tense negotiations ensures that britain and the 27-nation eu can continue to buy and sell goods without tariffs or quotas. that should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.
but companies face sheaves of new costs and paperwork, including customs declarations and border checks. traders are struggling to digest the new rules imposed by the 1,200-page trade deal.
the english channel port of dover and the eurotunnel passenger and freight route braced for delays as the new measures were introduced, though the pandemic and a holiday weekend meant cross-channel traffic was light, with only a trickle of trucks arriving at french border posts in calais as 2020 ended. the vital supply route was snarled for days after france closed its border to u.k. truckers for 48 hours last week in response to a fast-spreading variant of the virus identified in england.
the british government insisted that the border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the u.k.'s new start.
but freight companies were holding their breath. youngs transportation in the u.k. suspended services to the eu until jan. 11 to let things settle.
we figure it gives the country a week or so to get used to all of these new systems in and out, and we can have a look and hopefully resolve any issues in advance of actually sending our trucks, said the company's director, rob hollyman.
the services sector, which makes up 80% of britain's economy, does not even know what the rules will be for business with the eu in 2021. many of the details have yet to be hammered out. months and years of further discussion and argument over everything from fair competition to fish quotas lie ahead as britain and the eu settle into their new relationship as friends, neighbors and rivals.
hundreds of millions of individuals in britain and the bloc also face changes to their daily lives. britons and eu citizens have lost the automatic right to live and work in the other's territory. from now on, they will have to follow immigration rules and obtain work visas. tourists face new headaches including from travel insurance and pet paperwork.
for some in britain, including the prime minister, it's a moment of pride and a chance for the u.k. to set new diplomatic and economic priorities. johnson said the u.k. was now free to do trade deals around the world, and free to turbocharge our ambition to be a science superpower.
scotland's pro-independence first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted: 'scotland will be back soon, europe. keep the light on.'
conservative lawmaker bill cash, who has campaigned for brexit for decades, said it was a victory for democracy and sovereignty.
that's not a view widely shared across the channel. in the french president's traditional new year's address, emmanuel macron expressed regret.
the united kingdom remains our neighbor but also our friend and ally, he said. this choice of leaving europe, this brexit, was the child of european malaise and lots of lies and false promises.
the divorce could also have major constitutional repercussions for the united kingdom. northern ireland, which shares a border with eu member ireland, remains more closely tied to the bloc's economy under the divorce terms, a status that could pull it away from the rest of the u.k.
in scotland, which voted strongly in 2016 to remain, brexit has bolstered support for separation from the u.k. the country's pro-independence first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted: scotland will be back soon, europe. keep the light on.
many in britain felt apprehension about a leap into the unknown that is taking place during a pandemic that has upended life around the world.
i feel very sad that we're leaving, said jen pearcy-edwards, a filmmaker in london. i think that covid has overshadowed everything that is going on. but i think the other thing that has happened is that people feel a bigger sense of community, and i think that makes it even sadder that we're breaking up our community a bit, by leaving our neighbours in europe.
i'm hopeful that we find other ways to rebuild ties, she said.
robert h.b. baldwin, the former morgan stanley ms, +2.94% chairman credited with modernizing a wall street stalwart, has died. he was 95.
baldwin served as morgan stanley's president for six years before his election as chairman in 1979. he led the private partnership until 1983, when he ceded the post to his top lieutenant, s. parker gilbert.
business inventories in the u.s. rose 0.4% in november after no change in the prior month, the commerce department said friday. sales jumped 1.2% in the month. the ratio of inventories to sales, meanwhile, fell to 1.33 from 1.34. that's how many months it would take to sell all the inventory on hand. one year ago, the inventory-to-sales ratio was higher at 1.40, reflecting an excessive buildup in production not matched by sales. now companies appear to have a better handle on inventories.
there can be victory in defeat.
lady gaga and bradley cooper's a star is born was considered a shoo-in to sweep the golden globe awards on sunday night by outlets including the los angeles times, the new york times and vanity fair. instead, the actors sat smiling in the front row while bohemian rhapsody and green book took many of the top awards, and glenn close upset gaga for the best actress nod. gaga did share the best original song award for her hit shallow from the film, however, and expressed her gratitude — and her support for close — on twitter afterward.
i am so beyond grateful for this golden globe & honored to have won it w/ @markronson @wyattish, anthony rossomando and to have sang it with bradley cooper, she wrote. i also could not be happier for glenn close winning tonight. she is a true legend and deserves every award. thank you hfpa.
and after chicago bears' kicker cody parkey missed the field goal cost his team a playoff win against the eagles this week, he gamely went on the today show on friday and said, i'm disappointed. i let the fans down, my teammates down and the whole organization down. but i'll continue to keep my head held high because football is what i do; it's not who i am ... at the end of the day, i'm going to keep positive and keep swinging.
aliza licht has also experienced public disappointment. after 17 years doing pr for dkny, she started her own consulting firm in 2016 -- but after 10 months, she realized it wasn't working out. rather than sulking, she shared what she learned from her loss in her article, this is how you know you're not meant to be an entrepreneur for forbes.
own up to it. there's no reason to hide it. it's nothing to be ashamed of; everyone has failures, the author of leave your mark, told moneyish. it's embarrassing for a minute, and then everyone moves on. and you're onto the next thing, too.
after all, gaga still has plenty of chances to rebound; she's been nominated for five grammys, which air next month, including four for shallow, and she and cooper could still score nods when the oscar nominations are announced on jan. 22.

many pro athletes have also mastered the art of being good sports. when japan's soccer team was eliminated from the world cup last summer, they came out looking like winners by bowing to their fans in the stands after the devastating loss to belgium. they also cleaned their locker room on the way out, cnn reported, and left their russian hosts a thank you note (written in russian) inside the now-spotless changing room.
and the players weren't the only good sports. japanese fans have stayed after every one of their team's matches at the global soccer tournament to help clean their section of the stadium, leading sports illustrated to say the losing team has actually won the world cup. senegalese fans also tidied up their stadium section after beating france a couple of weeks ago.
and the year before, los angeles dodgers pitcher rich hill just missed throwing a no-hitter last summer, when he gave up a walk-off home run against the pittsburgh pirates in extra innings on his 99th pitch; losing the game. hill also just lost out on a perfect game after the third baseman made an error in the ninth inning. but when hill approached the press afterward, he gamely stuck up for his teammate, and vowed to come out swinging. i'm looking forward to tomorrow, getting in the gym and getting ready for the next outing, said hill. we have a lot of great things going on here. tomorrow is a big game. we have to take the series and get back home.
now that's how you handle a loss like a boss.
everyone likes to be around a winner - and that doesn't mean the person that wins the most games, career coach heather monahan, aka the boss in heels, told moneyish. that means the person with the winning attitude.
liza bychkov-suloti, a partner at the shadow public relations and marketing company, agreed. sometimes the way you accept defeat or adapt to change is just as, if not more, meaningful than how you succeed and control any outcome. supporting those that are successful or 'win' reflects a strong, confident character, she told moneyish.
no one's perfect, and it's inevitable that we're all going to bomb a sales pitch, presentation or some other work project at some point, or be on the losing team. so here's what we can learn about turning a loss into a win, especially when all eyes are on us.
if you never lose, it means you're not taking big enough risks. everyone knows gaga is an accomplished singer and songwriter; she's got six grammys under her bedazzled belt. but she took a chance with a star is born — it's not only her movie debut, but she was also directed to strip off her signature makeup to completely expose herself. when my character talks about how ugly she feels — that was real, gaga told the los angeles times. i'm so insecure. i like to preach, but i don't always practice what i preach. licht added that, it's essential in life to take risks. people shouldn't be afraid to fail, they shouldn't be afraid to try, because not trying really is the ultimate failure.
accept what you can and can't control. dr. jonathan fader, director of mental conditioning for the new york giants who was the new york mets' team psychologist for nine seasons, told moneyish that recognizing what is and isn't in your hands helps to just let it go when it doesn't work out. nolan ryan once said that a pitcher has two jobs: to choose the pitch and to execute it. what happens after that is out of your hands, dr. fader said. likewise, if you're a trader, you can pick this stock based on all of the statistical variants you know, but you don't have any control over unexpected bumps in the market, which can send your stock plummeting.
take a beat to reset yourself. so exactly how do you shake it off or let it go? dr. fader coaches players in mental conditioning and mindfulness to do a quick reset right after something goes wrong. when you watch baseball players closely, you'll see the pitcher or the batter taking a deep breath before each pitch, or looking at a focal point, like a blade of grass or a flagpole, to center themselves, he said. approach each moment independently. so if an interview isn't going well, or you get off to a rough start during a presentation or performance, just focus on something in the room, take a deep breath and start over.

embrace a new perspective. dr. fader's players also practice gratitude, which helps them to be good sports through wins and losses. and again, see gaga's very gracious posts thanking the hollywood foreign press association and congratulating close on twitter and instagram. if you think, 'i am so grateful that i get to compete at the highest level,' the one or two negative results don't loom as large, he said. apply that same approach to your job - you're lucky that you get to do what you love, or you're blessed to have a gig that supports your family, or you're working with a great team. that appreciation can help you take setbacks in stride.
build resilience. losses feel catastrophic in the moment, so look at the big picture: you've survived worse, and you can survive this, too. while dropping the ball on a new account and taking a professional hit can be difficult, that can never compare to other personal challenges in your life that you have overcome, said monahan, who suggests keeping a journal of the tough times you've already handled. reminding yourself of traumatic situations that you have lived through will bring your strength and the ability to see your current situation as less than dire in the moment.
take action. hill didn't dwell on the perfect no-hitter that wasn't. he told the press that he was already looking to thursday night's game, and planning to hit the gym. the decision to take action and change your situation is the single most impactful thing you can do, said monahan. what action can you take today to change your situation and set you up for success the next time opportunity knocks on your door?
bychkov-suloti agreed. don't shy away from examining your opportunity to learn and grow, she said. ask your boss (or the decision maker) for further background on the decision and the steps they'd like to see you take to achieve your goals.

medical technology company becton dickinson and co. bdx, -0.07% said friday it has received a warning letter from the u.s. food and drug administration relating to its preanalytical systems business unit. the company said it will provide a full response to the regulator by its feb. 1 deadline. we take any potential issue with our products very seriously and are cooperating fully with fda on this matter, richard byrd, worldwide president of the preanalytics business said in a statement. after the fda inspection in july, we took prompt action that we believed fully addressed the agency's inspectional observations. the fda said its letter cited several violations of federal law, including the marketing of modified versions of bd vacutainer blood collection tubes without securing fda approval and failing to submit medical device reports to the fda within a required timeframe. our inspection showed that bd violated the law by making a significant change to certain devices the company manufactures without notifying the fda and failing to follow good manufacturing practice requirements, said donald st. pierre, acting director of the office of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health and deputy director of new product evaluation at the fda's center for devices and radiological health. we are continuing to aggressively investigate this issue, including whether the use of bd tubes led to inaccurate lead test results. shares were slightly lower friday, but have gained 30% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% has gained 22%.

one very important theme for the stock market during 2018 was the return of volatility, as investors worried about federal reserve tightening and president trump's trade dispute with china.
the dow jones industrial average us:djia declined 5.6% during 2018, but it was down 13.4% from the intraday high it hit on oct. 3. illustrating that volatility, the best performer of the year among the s&p 500 us:spx was advanced micro devices us:amd, up 79.6% for the year but which also fell 40.2% during the fourth quarter.
this was the worst year for the dow since 2008, and the first decline for the benchmark index since 2015, when it was down 2.2%.

the only two s&p 500 sectors that were up for the year through were health care and utilities. the utilities sector was the least volatile when compared to its 52-week high. the energy sector fared worst, which is also probably no surprise, as the oil-price recovery stalled. west texas crude oil us:cl1 slumped 25% in 2018.

create an email alert for philip van doorn's deep dive columns here.
karen walker, the self-proclaimed pill-popping, jet fuel sniffing, gin-soaked narcissist, and her cadre of friends are coming back.
will & grace will return to nbc for a 10-episode revival in the 2017-2018 television season. the show will feature the main four members of the original cast: debra messing as interior designer grace adler; eric mccormack as gay attorney will truman and grace's best friend; megan mullally as the often inebriated socialite karen walker; and sean hayes as will's gay best friend. the show's creators, max mutchnick and david kohan, will executive produce the episodes. the original series ran on nbc cmcsa, -2.83% from 1998 to 2006 and was widely heralded as one of the most successful sitcoms with gay people as the main characters.
this is just the latest in a series of television shows, videogames, movies and other products that have gotten a reboot in the past few years. among them: the movie star wars, the nintendo 7974, -0.22% nes gaming console, and coke surge ko, -1.31% , crystal pepsi pep, -0.82% — all of which were hits for the companies that made them. star wars: the force awakens, released in 2015, made more than $930 million domestically in its first 16 weeks in the theater — the most money a movie has ever made in the u.s. and canada.
the classic nintendo nes classic edition sold out in almost every brick-and-mortar retailer this holiday season — and commanded online prices that were triple or more the $60 asking price. and soda reboots typically sell well too, says matthew barry, beverages analyst at market research group euromonitor — though exact figures typically for the most recent ones aren't always publicly released.
why consumers are gaga for product reboots
in today's high-tech, fast-paced world, consumers feel like they can't keep up-to-date all the new options and changes be they technological, entertainment or otherwise. we're living in a time of rapid change — people feel like they don't have power in preventing or dealing with this change, says brittany chozinski, an assistant professor of sociology at northeast lakeview college in san antonio, who studies nostalgia. they're trying to find an anchoring point, to slow down. and nostalgic products seem like they can do this, as people often see them — rightly or wrongly — as things from a simpler time, she says.
plus, studies show that experiencing nostalgic memories helps us feel more socially connected — a compelling prospect today because research shows that many of us are profoundly lonely. indeed, americans today have fewer close friends — people they can discuss important issues with — than in the past: they have an average of two, down from three just 25 years ago, according to research from sociology professor matthew brashears, who now works at the university of south carolina; and roughly one in four people says they have no one with whom they can discuss important issues with.
'will & grace' revival: will viewers be disappointed?
what this does to your bottom line
when we're feeling nostalgic, we spend more, a series of six experiments, published in the journal of consumer research in 2014, found. in one study, the experimenters showed participants two advertisements — one that made them feel nostalgic for the past and another that encouraged them to look toward the future. they were then asked how much they would spend on two nostalgic-related items — a bottle of coca-cola and a flip video camera. those that saw the nostalgic advertisement spent roughly 40% more than those who didn't. feelings of nostalgia make us spend more, says jannine lasaleta, an assistant professor of marketing at grenoble école de management in france.
how we're setting ourselves up for disappointment
plenty of critics wrote that the gilmore girls nflx, -3.75% reboot was very good: julia felsenthal, called it kind of brilliant in vogue, and others had nice things to say as well. but many fans felt, well, disappointed. that's to be expected, says chozinski. memories of the past are often idealized and sanitized, so we are setting ourselves up for disappointment when we buy nostalgic products hoping to get back that feeling, she says. at best it's escapism says chozinski. it's temporary. after we consume the item, we're right back to searching for whatever it is we were searching for when we bought the item.
why we can't quit the search for nostalgia
we'll pay a lot to get a nostalgic item, but its results are only temporary and it's often a disappointment. still, we still often can't stop ourselves from going back for another nostalgic item. the temptation of going back is so alluring that we are willing to do it. chozinski says. part of us knows we can never return to the past…but we still want it. she's not immune to it herself: i'm excited about the new 'twin peaks,' but i know it won't live up to my expectations.
the biggest news in the robo-adviser space so far this year? it's arguably that snapchat, twitter and other high-profile millennial favorites could jump in.
yes, that snapchat. the popular social app is apparently growing up. mature institutions like the white house and wall street journal hopped on snapchat in the new year, and your ira might be on it one day, too.
snapchat — with its 100 million daily users to tap into — stands at the front of a line of tech firms developing robo-adviser offerings, said a reuters report last week. the report added that twitter twtr, -1.76% has been approached about delivering a robot-run investing service and intuit's intu, -2.33% budgeting tool mint is working on going robo, too. even paypal's pypl, -2.53% payments app venmo is looking at helping users automatically invest spare change.
in a similar vein, a deloitte study in december suggested apple aapl, -1.93% and google parent alphabet goog, -1.26% googl, -1.26% could get into the robo-adviser space.
robo advisers basically provide automated investment portfolios of low-cost etfs via a website or app. they range from startups like betterment and wealthfront to schwab intelligent portfolios, an offering from big brokerage charles schwab schw, +2.78% .
so what's the deal with the possible interest from snapchat and other outsiders?
for investors, it means a new crop of companies asking to look after your nest egg, said michael kitces, partner and research director at pinnacle advisory group. now your social-media firms might start soliciting you for your money, too, he told marketwatch.
the news also means that the buzz around robos is still considerable. the fact that it even hit snapchat's radar screen is notable, said kitces, who publishes the nerd's eye view financial planning blog. but he warns against being fooled by the hype.
everybody's buzzing like it's still a hot area, but when you take a nuanced look at the space, companies are folding, they're pivoting away from consumers, they're getting out of the business, he said.
big independent robo advisors have a few billion dollars each in investor money, but that only translates to a few million dollars a year in revenue, he added. i don't know whether a multibillion-dollar social-media company even finds that to be an appealing market opportunity. ... that's kind of revenue chump change for them.
and kitces has other doubts. tech companies have a tendency to foster whispering about new features, not all of which actually come to pass, he said. he had this warning as well: whether a social-media messaging company can successfully convert people into being investors is a question that remains entirely open.
can't he say anything nice? yes. kitces praises snapchat's massive user base. that is arguably the one thing that snapchat has going for it — their sheer size and reach, he said.

san francisco (ap) — netflix is raising its u.s. prices by 13 percent to 18 percent, its biggest increase since the company launched its streaming service 12 years ago.
its most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $13 per month from $11. that option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than hbo, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.
the extra cash will help to pay for netflix's huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as amazon amzn, +0.33% , disney dis, -1.28% and at&t t, +0.20% .
this marks the fourth time that netflix nflx, +0.73% has raised its u.s. prices; the last hike came in late 2017 . but this is the first time that higher prices will hit all 58 million u.s. subscribers, the number netflix reported at the end of september.
previously, netflix had continued to offer a basic, $8-a-month streaming plan while raising rates on more comprehensive plans with better video quality and options to watch simultaneously on different devices.
this time, the price for the cheapest plan is going up to $9 per month. a premium plan offering ultra-high definition will jump to $16 per month from $14.
the new prices will immediately affect all new subscribers and then roll out to existing customers during the next three months. customers in about 40 latin america countries where netflix bills in u.s. currency will also be affected, excepting key international markets such as mexico and brazil.
netflix had nearly 79 million subscribers outside the u.s. as of september.
higher prices could alienate subscribers and possibly even trigger a wave of cancelations. for instance, netflix faced a huge backlash in 2011 when it unbundled video streaming from its older dvd-by-mail service, resulting in a 60 percent price increase for subscribers who wanted to keep both plans. netflix lost 600,000 subscribers after that switch.
the company is now betting it can gradually raise its prices, bolstered by a string of acclaimed hits during that past five years that have included house of cards, ''orange is the new black, ''stranger things, ''the crown and, most recently, the film bird box.
we change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall netflix experience, the company said in a statement.
consumers also have an increasing array of other streaming options .
amazon offers a streaming service as part of its prime shipping program for $13 per month, or $120 for an annual membership. hulu sells an ad-free service for $12 per month. at&t's warnermedia unit plans a broader streaming service this year centered on hbo. walt disney is gearing up to launch a streaming channel this year.
with apple also widely expected to join the video-streaming fray, the competition for programming is enabling top directors, writers and actors to charge more for their talents. that has intensified financial pressure on netflix, which hasn't been bringing in enough money to pay for all its programming and other business expenses.
the company burned through about $3 billion last year and is expecting to do so again this year. to offset the negative cash flow, netflix has been borrowing heavily to pay for programming. the los gatos, california, company had accumulated nearly $12 billion in debt before borrowing another $2 billion in an october bond offering.
concerns about the stiffening competition and netflix's ability to sustain its current leadership in video streaming has caused the company's stock price to slide by 21 percent from its peak of $423.21 reached last june. the shares stood at $332.94 heading into tuesday's trading session.
ford motor co. said tuesday it is scrapping plans for a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in mexico, instead choosing to build small cars in an existing mexican factory, and invest $700 million in a michigan facility that will build electric vehicles.
the move is a surprising turnaround for ford f, -1.58% after facing criticism by president-elect donald trump for more than a year in relation to its mexico plan. last month, chief executive mark fields said it was looking to work with the incoming administration on trump's trade agenda, but indicated it was too late to change its specific plan to build a new factory in mexico.
bond markets — and by association, stocks and the housing market, even gold — are hanging in the balance.
after a tumultuous few weeks, the 10-year treasury yield tmubmusd10y, 1.696% set several bearish milestones, then topped 2.60% on thursday to notch a three-year high. yields rise when prices fall and are telling not only for fixed-income investors and competing assets, but for anyone keeping track of borrowing costs.
from here, it's not entirely clear if the bond market selloff has enough momentum to sustain another big move.
it's easy enough to argue why bond yields should rise. the treasury department will unload a deluge of issuance this year, major central banks are set to start a long-awaited shift away from easy money policies and inflation expectations have begun to trickle higher thanks to tight labor markets.
the market is starting to question whether or not the stories used to explain the flattening yield curve, like how inflation is in check, strong international demand, and all of the things that were going to keep the long end anchored, is valid in the perspective of synchronized global growth, said marvin loh, senior fixed-income strategist at bny mellon.
investors say the european central bank and the bank of japan will finally make their much awaited shift away from their ultra-accommodative stance this year. market participants have pointed the finger at the two central banks for keeping a lid on long-dated treasury yields, as low-to-negative interest rates spurred a flight of investors from debt of both countries into u.s. government paper.

a process of normalization of the global low-yield environment, in turn driven by a re-coupling of monetary policy globally towards a removal of accommodation would ultimately bring up the 10-year yield up to its stable, long-term levels, said strategists at société générale, in a note.
though many such calls have turned out to be no more than false alarms, improving economic data in europe and japan has reportedly led their central bankers to rethink their policy guidance without spooking markets. insiders in the bank of japan said officials were confident of hitting the 2% inflation target, which has remained frustratingly out of reach, reported the wall street journal.
markets are also falling in line with the federal reserve's view of future interest rates, a stark change from last year.
back in 2017, the gulf between the fed and wall street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. policymakers including fed chairwoman janet yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.
this disconnect kept the 10-year yield depressed as investors wagered for a flattening of the yield curve, the slope of which reflected the spread between short-dated and long-dated bond yields.
but rising inflation expectations have had investors humming a new tune. a recent beige book report showed employers were open to raising wages to attract scarce workers, while higher commodity prices have pushed up breakeven rates, the market-based assessments of inflation prospects.
the 10-year breakeven rate established a three-year high of 2.09% on thursday as crude prices moved above $60 a barrel, as the chart below shows.
rising oil prices have stoked inflation expectations. ubs
traders now estimate the chance of three rate hikes this year to have risen above 50%, according to fed fund futures data. that's in line with the so-callled dot plot, an aggregate of senior fed officials' projections for interest rates, which showed a median forecast of three hikes in 2018.
on top of that, a wave of treasury issuance could swamp bond investors. the fed's reduction of its balance sheet and the deficit-widening tax cuts could ramp up the federal government's borrowing needs.
read: bond market braces for $ 1 trillion tsunami of treasurys this year
the supply deluge is unlikely to be a one-off if the budget shortfalls increase at their current pace. the committee for the responsible federal budget estimated the deficit to push above $1 trillion as early as 2019.
but matthew hornbach of morgan stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the treasury department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history. moreover, prices adjust much less on an outright basis when the actual supply hits the market than when expectations for an influx of supply started to build, he said. forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.
hornbach's point highlights how many of the factors blamed for the bond selloff were also present toward the tail end of last year. nonetheless, the 10-year yield ended largely where it began 2017.
we know all this, and have for a while, and that the price action that starts the new year, which is seasonally habitually bearish even in bull markets, is not necessarily prologue, said david ader, chief market strategist for informa intelligence, in a note.
it's tempting to dismiss the recent turn in bearish sentiment as a rite of spring, and that the pace at which yields have climbed has taken the move beyond its moorings.
but forecasts, including from goldman sachs and nomura, were already predicting bonds to come under pressure in the first quarter of 2018, but perhaps not at this disorienting speed. the 10-year yield gained more than 20 basis points in january.
if the move may have been too fast, it has not gone too far, said strategists at deutsche bank.
all the same, a short-term pullback could be on the cards, and even more so, if debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse, as they did in the government shutdown. appetite for u.s. government paper could suffer if credit ratings agencies see the political brinkmanship as a reason to strip away the u.s.'s gold-plated, triple-a credit rating.
human advisers and robo advisers, once thought to be competitors, will likely become partners in the years to come.
just like technology has altered and changed every industry, it is beginning in wealth management, said timothy welsh, a certified financial planner and president of nexus strategy. while the digital platforms have been around for a while, it is just now that we are starting to see their platforms start to become mainstream.
consider how two organizations, one the entity that oversees certified financial planners and the other, the association representing certified financial planners, are approaching the brave new world of human and robo advice.
• the cfp board center for financial planning in december released the findings of a panel of experts who explored the future effects of digital advice on the financial planning profession, according to a release. the cfp board, the regulatory body for the nation's certified financial professionals, said its panel of experts sought to identify the challenges and opportunities financial planners face as the worlds of human and automated financial advice collide.
• the financial planning association (fpa) announced, also in december, that betterment for advisors would become a strategic partner of the nation's largest association for certified financial planners. betterment for advisors will, among other things, teach the fpa's 24,000 members how digital investment advice can augment the robust financial planning services they are providing clients while staying true to the high-touch level of advice they are already providing, according to a press release.
experts largely praised the efforts by the fpa and cfp board to better understand how human and robo advisers can work together in the future. from these announcements, it appears that these two organizations are recognizing that the delivery of financial advice will be different in the future, and if they are to remain relevant for their members, they need to start building content and practice standards that include digital capabilities, welsh said. in fact their very futures as organizations depend on the human adviser being primary, and if the adviser job goes away than there won't be a need for them anymore.
in its research, the cfp board's digital advice working group, using a scenario-planning approach facilitated by heidrick & struggles, created a matrix of four potential future outcomes that took into consideration the nature of consumer demand for integrated advice and the level of consumer trust pertaining to the digital experience.
• everyone goes digital: in this scenario, the same sophisticated digital advice platforms underpin both the direct-to-consumer online experience as well as the tools used by human financial advisors.
• judgment day: this scenario assumes that digital advice accelerates to the point of ubiquity, with some form of financial advice available for free to most consumers.
• rise of the humans: in this scenario, growing complexity of financial products extends the time horizon to realize greater automation of financial advice.
• back to the future: in this scenario, a cyberattack directed at an online digital advice platform turns consumers away from human-less systems and drives a preference for the financial adviser.
to be fair, at least one expert suggested that the scenarios might mesh together in reality. while each of the four discrete scenarios in the cfp board paper are all possible outcomes in the future, i believe the future of digital advice will evolve to include elements of all four scenarios, said bill winterberg, founder and president of fppad.com.
no matter whether the cfp board's scenarios are discreet or not, another expert sees the need for financial advisers to contemplate all scenarios.
the simple fact that investors are increasing integration of digital communication into every aspect of their lives is going to necessitate the transformation of their financial advice relationships, said scott smith, director of research at cerulli associates and a member of the cfp board's digital advice working group. investors' expectations of what an advice provider will be able to deliver in terms of interaction and value will perpetually escalate.
this is not to say that each traditional provider immediately needs to launch a low-cost robo platform. but more to emphasize that digital engagement will become part of the core expectation of investors up and down the wealth continuum, said smith.
the question, he said, is not whether traditional firms will offer these types of platforms, but which will best connect their advisers to clients in ways that highlight the value of advisory services beyond commodified aspects of portfolio management.
can wall street close this gender gap?
according to cerulli associates' research, smith said there will be increasing pressure on traditional advice providers to broaden their advice services to maximize their value to clients. advisers will no longer be able to tout their services as 'wealth managers' while focusing almost exclusively on the implementation and rebalancing of an accumulation portfolio, he said.
smith also noted that over the last year, there has been a pronounced change in the robo advice landscape. prior to 2016 there was widespread concern across the industry that robo advisers would fundamentally disrupt the traditional financial advice market, he said. several start-up providers were gathering assets at meteoric rates and there were widespread assumptions that numerous other firms would jump into the market and enjoy similar success.
more recently, however, smith said it has become clear that the robo revolution will be most impactful as a catalyst to moving traditional advice providers into the digital age rather than replacing them outright.
instead of competing with them, many of the start-up robo advisors are increasingly serving as the plumbing connecting traditional advisory firms to their clients, said smith. many robo firms have engineered outstanding technology platforms, but have neither the brand recognition nor the network of field advisors to achieve the distribution scale they need.
by pairing advisers skilled in building out their natural markets and gathering assets, with platforms that allow them to optimize their efficiency, smith said provider firms will be better able to maximize their marketshare in the long term.
for his part, winterberg suggested that financial advisers must examine what aspects of their practice is right for robo and which isn't. financial advice providers must challenge themselves, and their business models, today to identify what aspects of their work are candidates for automation and algorithms, and what aspects cannot be automated, he said. the opportunity for advice providers' success in the future lies in augmenting the aspects of their business that are truly unique and difficult to scale, such as empathy for clients, evaluating and discussing tradeoffs, and offering a compromise to the actions clients can take.
another expert also suggested that there is high degree of uncertainty right now over robo and human advisers. legislative and regulatory changes over the next few years are likely to have an impact on the ultimate outcome, said joel bruckenstein, a certified financial planner and publisher of technology tools for today. in the near term, i think it's unlikely that digital will totally displace good financial advisers, but longer term, it is difficult to totally rule out.
perhaps the more interesting point, bruckenstein said is that the cfp board is interested enough in technology and digital advice to take a leadership role, while they continue to virtually ignore technology in the cfp educational program.
furthermore, to this day, the cfp board absolutely refuses to grant any ce credit at to advisers for improving their competency with these 21st century tools of the trade, he said. the cfp board did put together a very impressive group of experts to explore scenarios, most of who i know personally and respect, but until the cfp board gets its own house in order, it is difficult to take them seriously as a technology leader.
we feel that advisers have been using technology to improve front- and back-office functions for decades, said joe maugeri, managing director of corporate relations at cfp board. the more important question, though, is in regards to how advisers will change their practice to focus on things technology can't do, such as working with clients to define goals, explaining and working through behavioral finance issues and developing holistic financial plans ready to help investors in 2017 and beyond.
the cfp board believes, he said, that technology should be the tool that helps advisers do what is most meaningful: deepen client relationships and enhance the level of financial advice consumers receive. ultimately, technology will continue to evolve and create scale and capacity that will enable advisers to do their jobs better and empower stronger connections with the clients they serve, he said.
will fpa's deal with betterment lead to measurable change?
winterberg applauded the fpa for establishing a partnership with betterment for advisors, but he wasn't convinced that it will lead to any measurable change in the adoption of automated investment solutions by the association's membership.
access to thought leadership content and collaboration with industry influencers is just a tweet or an email away in today's world, and the fastest-growing advisers are already connecting with solution providers to implement tools for digital advice, he said. the partnership will allow betterment for advisors to deliver content to a larger audience, but i'm not certain if that will result in engagement and attention from the fpa membership.
bruckenstein wasn't convinced that the fpa's deal with betterment was a game changer either. the fpa does have over 20,000 members, but they are not a homogenous group, and they don't always follow the fpa blindly, he said. i've yet to encounter an adviser who chooses a piece of software based solely upon a sponsorship that a firm has with fpa.
to be sure, the sponsorship will surely bring visibility to betterment among some advisers, bruckenstein said. but in the end, advisers choose providers based upon the specific needs of their firm, he said. i think the challenge for the fpa will be to retain the loyalty and support of other digital providers who compete with betterment.
for her part, lauren schadle, the executive director and ceo of fpa, said the collaboration is not about whether fpa members decide to adopt the betterment for advisors platform for their respective businesses. rather, it provides our members with a greater understanding of the technology involved so they can make a more informed decision by providing betterment with an opportunity to connect more deeply with the fpa advisor community, she said.
the fact is that financial planning is a very high touch profession that requires the skill of a cfp professional, said schadle. the use of technologies like those offered by betterment for advisors can augment financial planning offerings for those members and firms that choose to do so, she said. our focus now is on working with the betterment team to see how we can integrate their experts and content with the expertise of fpa's adviser community.
welsh said the efforts by the cfp board and fpa are just baby steps. the real change is coming soon as technology becomes a bigger piece of financial services and organizations like the fpa and cfp board will need to up their game to continue leading the way, he said.

mcdonald's corp.'s fourth-quarter global same-store sales increase of 2.7% includes strong results in asia, with china and japan reporting increases, even as u.s. same-store sales slipped.
global same-store sales were expected to increase a more-modest 1.3%, according to factset estimates.
fourth-quarter same-store sales in the company's high-growth segment increased 4.7%, with the fast-food giant mcd, -0.54% highlighting a strong performance in china, including improved restaurant profitability.
same-store sales jumped 11.1% in foundational markets, with japan leading the way, the company said. some latin american markets also contributed to the strong showing.
see also:mcdonald's u.s. same-store sales fall, rise abroad
faced with a tough comparison with last year's all-day-breakfast launch, mcdonald's reported a fourth-quarter same-store sales decline of 1.3% in the u.s. the u.s. same-store sales result still beat the 1.4% decline in the factset forecast.
the company expects all-day breakfast comparisons to be a hurdle going forward.
here's what's behind the whiskey boom in the u.s.
as we begin the first quarter of 2017, we are mindful of the comparison we face against first quarter 2016 results, which benefited from [the extra day from] leap year, favorable weather and continued momentum from all-day breakfast in the u.s., said chief executive steve easterbrook in a statement.
see also: mcdonald's turns up the heat with fast-food rivals in siberia
read also:mcdonald's looks to sell part of japan business stake
mcdonald's results beat expectations, though sales slipped year over year. earnings per share totaled $1.44, beating the $1.41 factset consensus and rising from $1.31 last year. sales totaled $6.03 billion, down from $6.34 billion last year, but above the $6.00 billion factset consensus.
analysts at conlumino say the all-day breakfast menu was the right call, but has come with the pitfalls of offering cheaper options. customers are choosing the less-expensive items, but the menu isn't necessarily driving new customers.
many have exploited this and average transaction values for lunch and dinner have fallen as a consequence, something that has put a dampener on overall growth, said conlumino chief executive neil saunders in a monday note. widening the audience in a sustainable way is the key issue for mcdonald's as it enters [its] new fiscal year. this has to be more than about menu change —including the recent introduction of multiple sizes of big macs which, in our opinion, does nothing to create step change or to increase real choice.

saunders suggested that mcdonald's needs to be more radical with its changes, like opening a new restaurant brand, and consider the state of restaurants in the u.s., which leaves a lot to be desired.
mallinckrodt plc shares rebounded 3.5% in morning trade thursday, after the company announced a $100 million settlement with the federal trade commission on wednesday over allegedly using its monopoly to hike prices on its largest product.
as part of the settlement, the company us:mnk will license rights to a competing drug — which it acquired in 2013 — to marathon pharmaceuticals llc for use in two disease areas.
the new licensing direction will not affect the company's net sales because it currently gets no u.s. revenue from the competing drug, mallinckrodt said.
mallinckrodt's hp acthar gel, which treats infantile spasms, and its price hike to more than $34,000 per vial today from $40 a vial, are at the center of the ftc allegations.
the product is still a hand grenade, but we see no change in fundamentals, said raymond james analyst elliot wilbur on wednesday, who maintained an outperform rating for the company.

acthar will likely remain controversial, schott said, but the company continues to generate strong operating cash flows, and we expect the company to continue to focus on diversifying the business through business development.
the ftc said wednesday that mallinckrodt illegally acquired the u.s. rights to develop a competing adrenocorticotropic hormone drug, a space in which its acthar drug had a monopoly.
but wilbur, and mallinckrodt on a wednesday call, said that despite some similarities, the two drugs weren't exactly the same.

that's from a letter larry fink, founder and ceo of blackrock, penned to business leaders, according to a draft obtained by the new york times, which said the note could mark a watershed moment on wall street.

investor insanity about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain is in full bloom.
those with trading experience have two choices: complain about the insanity or take advantage of the insanity to make money.
those choosing to make money ought to make sure they have a proven methodology in place to control risk. it is easier to control risk in bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks than in currencies themselves, such as trading bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% ethereum and ripple.
let me illustrate with a chart of a former dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% stock that has produced a 220% gain in one day after the arora report issued a buy signal.
please click here for the annotated chart of eastman kodak kodk, -5.19% . this is the old camera-film giant that used to be in dow until 2004. the stock represents the company that emerged from bankruptcy. please note the following from the chart:
• the arora report gave a buy signal when the stock was at $3.80. at the time of the buy signal, the first target of $6.50 to $8.80 was given. we said if it catches the fancy of the momo (momentum) crowd, it could go as high as $17. as a risk-control measure, the stop zone was given at $2.73 to $2.88.
• a simple technique that investors will find useful to double their returns and control risk is to buy a core quantity and then surround it with trade-around positions. to the arora report subscribers, we provide a detailed methodology for using this technique. along with the buy signal, the call was to add trade-around positions with tighter stops to lower risk.
• the chart shows that, initially, volume spiked but the vud indicator was orange. this indicated that even though the stock was rocketing, there was net selling in the real time. our separate algorithms picked up extensive short selling. apparently short sellers did not believe in the rise. short sellers were betting on the stock to fall back to earth.
• the chart shows that after-hours volume dried up but was still heavy relative to the time of the day.
• the chart shows that, in the after-hours, the vud indicator turned green. this showed net real-time buying. our separate algorithms detected a short squeeze. in a short squeeze, short sellers panic, and then buy the stock to cover their positions. this panic buying adds fuel for a further rise.
• the chart shows arora's call to take partial profits when the first target was reached.
• the chart shows the point when stops were raised to break-even.
• the chart shows the point where stops were raised to protect profits.
• the chart shows the point where the stops were raised again to protect bigger profits. by taking partial profits and raising the stops, the risk was controlled while enjoying gains in the explosive move.

shares of theater chain amc entertainment holding inc. amc, +3.24% were down more than 2% in premarket trade on wednesday after being downgraded to sector perform from outperform at rbc capital markets. rbc analysts wrote in a note that their tepid view of the 2018 box office and amc's high leverage make for a challenging combination for the company. we'd likely get more bullish on amc if the box office outlook (given its leverage) and, or there was traction on the international ipo, lead analyst leo kulp wrote. as was evidenced in 2017, amc's leverage makes it very susceptible to changes in multiple. we estimate a one point ev/ebitda multiple change has a 36% impact on the stock price. while this is a positive in an up year for the box office, the uncertainty around the 2018 box office makes us more conservative. kulp expects that the 2018 box office will be flat compared with 2017, which was down slightly from the last two years. they said they see fewer big event films being released this year, and instead more non-sequel content, which could be a negative or a positive depending on how the shift in the box office is received. shares of amc have declined more than 59% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% is up more than 21% and the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% is up nearly 28%.
the latest trend among companies trying to drum up interest: announcing plans to introduce blockchain into the business.
eastman kodak co. on tuesday became the latest to do so, when the company said it would begin a major blockchain initiative. kodak intends to use digital ledgers to help photographers license their work and get paid for usage.
the stock kodk, -5.19% more than doubled on the news, rocketing $3.70, or 119%, to $6.80 in very active trade, after being down as much as 1.6% before the news. trading volume spiked to 64.9 million shares from a full-day average volume of about 264,000 shares, according to factset.
after closing at a record low of $3.05 as recently as jan. 4, the tuesday move was the biggest gain and saw the most shares traded in a day since the stock began trading in its current form in september 2013.
the company and wenn digital announced the launch tuesday of the kodakone image-rights management platform and kodakcoin, a photo-centric cryptocurrency.
for its part, kodak acknowledged in its press release that blockchain, like cryptocurrency, is a hot buzzword right now, but ceo jeff clarke said that the technology will actually prove useful in the company's case. for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem, he said in the release.
kodak added that distributed-ledger technology, which is the backbone of cryptographic currencies, will help spot unlicensed usage of photos.
we are using ethereum smart contracts, but we're also developing our own proprietary blockchain and will evaluate the optimal solution during development, kodak said in a statement.
the company, founded in 1888 in rochester, n.y., said it plans to launch an initial coin offering, or ico, for kodakcoin, the cryptocurrency that will become the backbone of the new payment system. icos have emerged as a method of raising capital among ventures using digital tokens.
the ico target is $20 million, with the potential to go up to $100 million.
this is a wenn digital currency, kodak said in a statement. eastman kodak company will not be an issuer of the ico, will not receive proceeds on the ico.
companies demonstrating sudden interest in blockchain of late have been well received by investors looking for new ways to play the cryptocurrency trend. shares of riot blockchain inc. riot, -7.03% , once an unknown animal healthcare company, have soared since the company announced its pivot toward blockchain. see cryptowatch.
then there are the more established brands, including long island iced tea corp., which recently became long blockchain corp. us:lbcc and enjoyed a nice stock-market boost for the name change. hooters parent chanticleer holdings inc. us:burg said earlier this month that it would use cryptocurrency for its loyalty program, which sent the chanticleer stock up sharply.
kodak, which emerged from bankruptcy in september 2013 after a precipitous decline in fortunes that found it evicted from the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% in 2004, is a poster child for failing to embrace new technologies fast enough.

kodak's blockchain announcement boosted the company's market value by $157.5 million on tuesday, to $289.5 million. the stock remains down 55.6% over the past 12 months, compared with a 27.9% rally in the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% , even after tuesday's run-up.
kodak was a dow member from july 1930 to april 2004.
last year didn't just bring change. it brought a seismic schism that will permanently alter how we work and live. what began as a public health crisis — one that will continue into the new year — became an unprecedented series of different crises that also took both jobs and the stock market on a roller-coaster ride.
as we head into 2021, it's time to look ahead for how we can take what we've learned from the past 12 months — and further back — and sort out the trends that will be most advantageous.

part great recession, part great reinvention
like the last financial crisis of 2008-2010, this year economic volatility drove people to focus on high quality assets and liquidity while taking on less risk. but over the course of the pandemic, we started to see job losses stabilize, at least compared with a decade ago, and stocks bounced back and even surged.
this allowed for many to shift from being focused on their next paycheck to insuring against adverse events impacting their own health. in fact, we saw a notable difference in the purchase of health protection products compared with a decade ago.

the three most important words in finance are 'digital, digital, digital'
the 'need for immediacy' was becoming a cornerstone of the financial world before the pandemic, but in 2020 we experienced a decade's worth of digital transformation in just six months. the industry's focus on digital innovation is particularly critical as millennials and generation z increase their share of the personal finance marketplace. in fact, our recent consumer poll showed that more than half of these groups would prefer to make purchase decisions through digital experiences using virtual or augmented reality technology.
as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, the digital experience for all financial offerings must catch up to comparable industries as everyone expects compelling products, seamless engagement and access to a broad shelf of offerings how and when they want them.
one crisis detoured — student loan debt

while we don't know the full extent to which loan repayment policies will change, it's possible that everything from income-driven repayment to full on debt cancellation is in play. no matter the specific outcome, this new dynamic will allow for greater focus on emergency and long-term savings alongside retirement planning.

we entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. in fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.
looking ahead, the importance of trust has never been more critical, now ranking as the second most important factor in purchasing decisions. when it comes to your finances, we're seeing the bumpy social media ride of this past year push many toward quality, trusting expert advice over friend-turned-unfriended 'sources.'
this past year tested us all in ways we never could have predicted. but now that we all know what we're capable of, we can plan ahead and ensure we're more prepared for the obstacles facing us in 2021.

the s&p 500 and the nasdaq composite closed at new records on tuesday while the dow jones industrial average resumed its march toward the psychologically-important 20,000, finishing less than 90 points away from the elusive milestone.
gains for stocks came after a solid round of corporate earnings boosted investor sentiment, providing a catalsyt after mostly lackluster trading following president donald trump's inauguration on friday. upbeat earnings may help investors justify what had been an otherwise rapid ascent in equity values since the real estate mogul's november election win, underpinned by the belief that he would implement a slate of pro-business policies to help rev up u.s. economic growth.
earnings are coming in generally better than expected while economic data are also good. we believe the medium-term bias in equity markets is to the upside, said karyn cavanaugh, senior market strategist at voya financial.
the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% rose 14.87 points, or 0.7%, to close at 2,280.07. materials and financials led the gains, while telecoms and health-care stocks were the biggest laggards.
the dow djia, -0.46% gained 112.86 points, or 0.6%, to finish at 19,912.71 and the nasdaq composite comp, -3.02% advanced 48.01 points, or 0.9%, to end at 5,600.96.

cavanaugh cautioned that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the impact the trump administration's trade and business policies will have on the economy and markets. that uncertainty has led to volatile trade in equities and currencies as trump forms his cabinet, meets with titans of industry and lays out his policy plans.

If the 401(k) was funded with pretax contributions, any amount converted will be taxable to them but converting to Roth could be a good move because at 21 and 23, they are likely in a low tax bracket. If they convert, invest prudently, and leave the funds alone, in 2030 they could get a good chunk of money tax-free at a time when they may be in a higher tax bracket.

The checks should be made payable to the Inherited Roth IRA not your daughters as individuals. If they get a check individually, it is considered a distribution not eligible for rollover.

The amount converted is taxable income to the girls in the year of the conversion but once that is done, they can get any of those converted funds out tax-free at any time. The normal 5-year rule for conversions does not apply because the distribution from the 401(k) is due to the death of the participant.

Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.

The economic impact payment does not measure how much is in your bank account. There is no way the government can browse the property records of every single American. It is an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return, and that is used as a guide on how people are faring. If you are earning $75,000 a year as an individual or $150,000 a year as a couple, you qualify. After that there is a sliding scale, which bottoms out at $99,000 for an individual or $198,000 as a couple.

They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country.

It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.

That leaves one more avenue for states to pursue — enacting benefit reforms. According to the table, if the funding gap were closed entirely by increases in worker contributions, that increase would have to be monumental — by at least 400% in each of the four states. Such an increase would not be acceptable to public unions, and further would not be legally permissible in many states because of constitutional protections for accrued pension benefits.

The table shows the current obligations ratio for each state — the percentage of its revenues currently devoted to paying down its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations plus interest on its state bonds. The table then compares that ratio to each state's full accrual obligations ratio. This latter ratio was calculated based on two reasonable assumptions — first, that state should pay down their unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities over 30 years, and, second, that annual investment returns of states would average 6% over this period.

The slump, shown in official data Monday, ended the growth that many foreign and domestic auto makers had expected to last for years to come. Facing saturation elsewhere, global auto makers have banked on China, the world's largest car market.

Sunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.
We also need to give Americans affordable banking options.
While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.
Subway is clearly troubled, and this continues to represent a market-share opportunity for other quick-service concepts in the U.S. — including McDonald's, and arguable perhaps even to a greater degree than any other single quick-service concept, Kalinowski wrote.
Instinet analysts named the fast-food giant its top U.S. restaurant pick for 2018 citing a number of factors, including the rollout of fresh-never-frozen beef for quarter-pound patties in nearly all of its restaurants by midyear.
This can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Roth IRA by the time one turns 70.
Forgot protectionism — if President-elect Donald Trump wants U.S. car makers to outdo the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz, then the American auto industry needs to step it up a gear, a top German minister has said.
Headline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy, which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.
If you don't need a stimulus check, and you don't qualify, leave it at that. You will drive yourself crazy peeking over the office silo wondering why somebody else got one, trying to size up their socioeconomic status like RoboCop. Today, it will be the colleague with 10 homes who is bragging about his/her stimulus check in the office and what they're going to spend it on. Tomorrow, it will be your neighbor. The day after that, you could be browsing the dark web. It's a slippery slope.
As you can see, the three-year trend is favorable, despite the occasional decline. Decreases may be worrisome, especially if you look at the stock market's results every day. But your 401(k) contributions would continue to be made as long as your employer pays you, so you would have paid lower prices and beaten the market's overall return.
When you walk down Fifth Avenue, everybody has a Mercedes-Benz parked in front of his house, Trump said in an interview with The Times of London and German tabloid Bild. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Not many, maybe none, you don't see anything at all over there. It's a one-way street.
Headline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures. Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.

The American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive, Gabriel told Bild on Monday. If U.S. buyers are choosing German models, as Trump suggests, then that's why the U.S. needs to build better cars, he said.
We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.
Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.
Every selloff since 2009, except for March, has been because of higher rates, Engelke said, adding that Monday's climb in inflation expectations is being driven by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, massive amounts of stimulus from the federal government and the potential for more spending from a Biden administration.
Here are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.
Long-dated Treasury yields, which rose during the second half of the last year, remained below their peaks in March, however, largely due to lack of inflation.
Here's another example, this time with a $100,000 annual salary. You still receive a 5% match for your contributions, but you also max them out at $18,000 a year.

Our view of the strength of McDonald's initiatives around value, digital and food quality… leads to a dimmer view of competing concepts which we expect will be market share donors, Saleh wrote in a separate note. We recognize there are still positives to the Jack in the Box story including the finalized sale of Qdoba, refranchising and tax reform benefit, but the weaker sales outlook leads to a more balanced view of the shares and we are downgrading accordingly.

Wright favors high-quality companies, based on factors that include financial strength, and consistent dividend and earnings growth.

We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country.

Shares of Regal Entertainment Group US:RGC, the nation's largest film exhibitor, are down about 10% over the past three months but have performed better than its peers, leading Kulp to downgrade the stock to sector perform from outperform and knock the price target to $19 from $24.
Reform of public pensions will be much more difficult. Although states may establish a different retirement system for their newly hired employees, this will take years to have much of a financial impact. Already accrued benefits are sacrosanct in most states — with the notable exception of reduced adjustments for costs of living, which have been allowed by many courts.
While this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality.
5 types of budgets and how to make one that actually works for you
You could spend your savings, but a judge is likely to see your sudden generous payments to your mortgage and car, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that is likely to go against you in the long run.  — The Moneyologist
With a potentially stronger 2017 film slate, better exhibitor film rents — the amount theaters pay to studios per ticket sold to screen a movie — and the possibility of mergers and acquisitions throughout the sector, Kulp said AMC's stock is at a level that positions it to outperform its rivals. He upgraded the stock to outperform from sector perform, while lowering his 12-month price target to $27 from $32.
The rebound in yields follows five straight sessions of declines, when optimism about tax reforms that sent the 10-year yield to as high as 2.5% in late December fizzled out by the end of the last year.
Still, Meyer also expects markets to look past the pandemic's toll and focus on the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which has come under scrutiny as the pace of the rollout has fallen short of earlier forecasts.

When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.
If Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say break 'em up. And he would be right.
You could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. She didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. Had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.

Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.
Sometimes (actually, make that often times) the greatest wisdom comes from children. In that spirit, listen to what this little tells her father when he asks to help undo her seat belt. That's the kind of spirit we need in a deeply polarized America right now. Be careful about coveting other people's stimulus checks, homes or even their lives. It's easy to believe we deserve more than our neighbor or, hell, even our identical twin, and how everything is easier for them.
The benefits of owning a Roth IRA are nothing short of amazing. A Roth grows without any taxes and all amounts withdrawn are tax-free.
Nancy Pelosi retakes House speaker's gavel as new Congress convenes
He also cut his Carmike Cinemas Inc. US:CKEC price target to $27 from $32, but also maintained an outperform rating. Carmike, which has about 2,800 screens, generally in midsize communities, has the greatest upside of any other exhibitor from either buying another company or being bought, he said. The theater chain will also likely outperform peers as it institutes a tax-on-top pricing strategy — essentially a stealthy way to increase ticket and concession prices. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price would stay the same but no longer include tax. Kulp said AMC benefited from a similar strategy last year.
Today, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.

Chances are, especially if your career has decades to go, that your 401(k) money will be invested in stock mutual funds, including low-priced index funds. That instant 100% return provides plenty of downside protection. Yes, it's a tall order to sock away 5% of your gross pay. It may feel as if you took a painful pay cut. But watch your account grow, and you will be amazed.
The new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.
[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition, the note said.

Market outlook: A core tenet at Motley Fool is that it's impossible to make market calls. So Greifner has none for 2018. If you have a long-term perspective with stocks, then the near-term market outlook doesn't really matter, says Greifner.
What's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). The upside: Alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. Divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. You should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. It pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.
In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.
Further, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.

That's a lot of money, especially for our example of a $75,000 salary, for which $18,000 in contributions would amount to 24%.
In May 2015, Financial Engines released the results of a study that concluded workers in the U.S. were leaving $24 billion a year on the table because they don't contribute enough to take full advantage of employers' matching 401(k) retirement-plan contributions.
The operative word here is consider. Maxing out your 401(k) contribution isn't for everybody. Your salary might not be high enough. Or you might have another opportunity to invest money outside your 401(k) to make even higher returns. Maybe so, but if you do not contribute to a retirement account, will you really make other investments, or will you simply spend the money on a larger house, a better car or more toys?
Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings – ratings that they knew were bogus.

We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.
Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Trump has been on a campaign to get U.S. auto makers such as Ford Motor Co. F, -1.58% and General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% to shift manufacturing jobs from foreign plants back to the U.S. Several car makers have scrapped plans for new plants in locations such as Mexico, or said they would consider doing so in response to Trump's threat of high border tariffs.

The American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.
But on Monday, Chicago Federal Resere President Charles Evans said it likely will take years to get average inflation up to 2%, which means monetary policy will be accommodative for a long time, in a speech at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association.

I'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. We live in California, a community property state. We live in a house which I bought before the marriage for $700,000, and it's appreciated to $1.2 million. I continue to pay my mortgage on it. I don't have much in savings, just $20,000, and $100,000 in retirement. Is there anything I can do to protect my money? Should I put extra money towards my car or house payments?

Anticipating the policy agenda of the incoming Biden administration is a key focus for investors in the new year, Jason Pride, chief investment officer, private wealth at Glenmede wrote in a team strategy note Monday. If the GOP wins just one seat, they will likely stonewall some of Biden's more ambitious proposals, but a Democratic sweep of both elections might give the incoming administration free rein on their policy agenda.
But you can start small. Let's say that, in our example, you begin by contributing 5% a year to take full advantage of the match. Over the years, as your salary increases or you get promoted or move on to higher-paying jobs, you might slowly increase your annual contributions. How about increasing it by at least 1% per year? Eventually you will be maxing out your contributions, without feeing too much pain in any one year.
The expected increase in spending translates into more back-end supply and higher inflation, hence the steeper curve, said Kevin Walter, co-head of Treasurys trading at Barclays.

Here's how astute investors should think about Apple's stock today
A 401(k) is a tax-deferred retirement plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your salary before taxes. The money is then invested according to your selections and remains tax deferred. The price is that you cannot withdraw any of the money until the year you turn 59 and a half, without paying a penalty. Then, when you are retired and begin withdrawing the money, it will be taxable income, presumably at a lower rate.

Buckingham thinks the shares have been beaten down too far by investors overly worried about weakness in its ESPN division, and competition from Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% .
And the FBI has confronted a surge in violent from anti-government and racially motivated extremists. That is a familiar threat to Garland, who as a senior Justice Department official in 1995 helped manage the federal government's response to the bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. The bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who was later executed.
Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +3.68% ended shy of a new $700 billion market cap milestone, after trading above that level earlier Monday, with the stock price needing to close at or above $738.474, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
And, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.
While in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of Bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster Dr. Pepper Snapple's sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if Bai is sold to another company, the Monday note said.
The stock has underperformed peers due to its limited liquidity and is now trading at a meaningful discount, Kulp wrote. We have a positive outlook on the 2017 box office that we think the market currently isn't focusing on, but will begin to around [the second quarter]. Given the below-peer multiple, we believe AMC has the most upside over the next 12 months.
The truth, however, is that we never really know.

Brookfield Property BPY, +1.29% shares rose 17.6% after parent company Brookfield Asset Management offered $5.9 billion to buy out public shareholders in the entity for $16.50 per unit. Brookfield is a large, global holder of office properties and shopping malls.
The new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.
The reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?
This is when an individual has stopped working, is not taking Social Security, and income has dropped to close to zero. Sometimes there is income from dividends in a taxable account or rental property, but broadly speaking they've hit a dramatic income trough.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been on a shopping spree at the start of the year and Phillips 66 has been the beneficiary. See full story.
In August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.
And, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.
You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.
In this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. Contributions are typically made every pay period. The bottom line is: Each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. You will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. This means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. For some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.
Put these four financial self-care habits into action to empower yourself and end the stressing about money.
Garland was put forward by former President Barack Obama for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to hold hearings in the final year of Obama's term. The vacancy was later filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch during the Trump administration.
A state has payment obligations from three main sources — interest on its outstanding bonds, unfunded liabilities for pension benefits, and unfunded liabilities for health care payments to state retirees (before Medicare at age 65). The interest on outstanding state bonds is relatively easy to estimate; the total outstanding amount of all state bonds was $500 billion in 2016. With the advent of improved accounting rules, it is now possible to compute the unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities of each state.
The new federal restrictions on SALT deductions ring the death knell for this strategy of raising state taxes to meet unfunded benefit obligations. For instance, middle-class residents of these four states are already paying effective tax rates of 9% to 12% — from local income, property and sales taxes. Since Congress has now limited SALT deductions to $10,000, residents of high-tax states are likely to push hard on their elected officials to lower local income and property taxes.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index FXXP00, +0.19% closed up 0.7%, and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 UKX, -0.60% climbed 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.53% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.35% both close 0.9% higher, while Korea's Kospi 180721, +0.78% surged 2.5%.

Today, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.
We will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
Some people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.
The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.
The Dow DJIA, -0.46% on Friday reached a high of 19,999.63, or about .37 point from achieving history—at least in psychological terms. In other words, a 5.5 cent move in any one of the price-weighted Dow's components would have tipped it over the edge, based on the Dow divisor of 0.14602128.
At the time of the bombing, Garland was 42 and principal associate deputy attorney general, a top lieutenant to Attorney General Janet Reno. He was chosen to go to Oklahoma City, the highest-ranking Justice Department official there, and led the prosecution for a month until a permanent lead prosecutor was named.

Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has increased his investment in the electric-car maker, using more than $50 million of his own money to cover the taxes on shares that cost him less than $7 apiece.
It is rare but not unprecedented for attorneys general to have previously served as judges. It happened in 2007 when President George W. Bush picked Michael Mukasey, a former federal judge in Manhattan, for the job. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's first attorney general, had also previously been a Superior Court judge.

Wall Street also has been keeping an eye on Georgia's as runoff elections on Tuesday in which two U.S. Senate seats have the potential to inject fresh volatility into markets, particularly if the outcome sparks political turbulence in Washington around recent fiscal spending measures and easy-money policies out of the Federal Reserve.
Converting in smaller amounts for several years is a wise move, but even then your income will be higher every year. Because taxes are progressive, you end up paying your highest personal tax rate on those converted IRA dollars.

After several years of playing defense, we believe McDonald's is finally returning to an offensive strategy which will yield stronger comp growth and increased market share, wrote analysts led by Peter Saleh.
Finally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.
Who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one?
While GM's Chevy brand doesn't have a big presence in Germany, the car giant's Opel unit last year said that its market share in Germany was roughly 8%. Mercedes-Benz and BMW each have achieved U.S. market shares of about 2%, according to Statista.
These large increases in state revenues are not feasible, as illustrated by Illinois. To cope with its mammoth unfunded benefit obligations, Illinois has sharply raised tax rates on both individuals and businesses over the past few years. But higher tax rates in Illinois have backfired — driving local residents and firms to other states. In 2015, for example, Illinois lost $4.75 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, according to IRS data.
Greifner looks for well-run companies whose shares are trading at attractive levels, to hold for the long term.
Let me help shatter that myth today.
And, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.
With the economic calendar light on Tuesday, Treasury prices have taken their cue from U.S. equity markets, which began 2018 on a high note. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to notch fresh record high at 2,695.79 on Tuesday.
In U.S. economic data, Automatic Data Processing Inc. said private-sector employment fell by 123,000 in December, the first decline in 8 months, after increasing 304,000 in the previous month. Factory orders rose 1% in November.
Market outlook: Unsurprisingly, given his penchant for value, Putnam thinks the market looks pretty rich. He's also troubled by elevated investor sentiment.
The recently enacted U.S. tax law restricts federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $10,000 — including local property and sales taxes as well as local income taxes. While this new restriction will have many implications, it will have a particularly draconian impact on states with large unfunded liabilities for pension benefits and retiree health care, in particular the residents of Illinois, Kentucky, Connecticut, and New Jersey.
Investors saw fresh manufacturing sector data in Asia and Europe that was better than expected, reflecting improvement from the stultifying levels of economic expansion prevalent during the pandemic, according to surveys of purchasing managers for December.

There are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. I recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. That's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.
U.S. vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui on Sunday said that the U.S. could increase its vaccine rollout by giving out half doses of the medication developed by Moderna MRNA, -5.43% . The biotechnology company on Monday said it was ramping up production of its COVID-19 vaccine for distribution in the U.S. and globally.
Since 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.
How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?

Gabriel — who as vice-chancellor, is seen as deputy to German leader Angela Merkel — responded by saying the U.S. should focus on building more attractive auto models, rather than penalizing competition.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to let the nomination move forward in the Senate in the final months of Obama's tenure. He was criticized by Democrats this fall when he took the opposite approach toward confirming President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett. He said the difference this time around was that the White House and Senate were controlled by the same political parties.

And, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.
It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.
Airbnb called the ruling a 'huge win.'
Market outlook: Investor sentiment is running high, a potential negative. But stocks overall still look reasonably valued given how low interest rates are. A selloff is possible at any time, given investor exuberance. But a recession is not on the horizon, so any significant weakness should present a buying opportunity.
In my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other too- big-to-fail banks into pieces. And that's exactly what we need to do. And that's what I commit to do as president.
The taxes are due in the year you convert at your regular income-tax rate. If you move a large sum all at once that can bump you into a higher tax bracket.
Biden is expected to announce Garland's appointment on Thursday, along with other senior leaders of the department, including former homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general and former Justice Department civil rights chief Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general.
Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.
States could also deal with unfunded benefit obligations by making substantial cuts in non-retirement spending — between 13% and 24% of state revenues according to the table. But local voters will vociferously object to substantial cuts in public services in areas such as education, transportation, and police protection.
Once a dominant player in the region, Exxon XOM, -4.31% is joining other oil firms in a race to build up drilling portfolios in West Texas and New Mexico. Even as crude prices hover slightly above $50 a barrel, about half the level of three years ago, the value of land in the Permian basin has skyrocketed to records amid a flurry of land buying as companies gear up for a rebound.

The new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the U.K., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.
We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.
Some market participants say any complacency about the runoff among investors might be misplaced, namely if Democrats win both Senate seats and help President-elect Joe Biden reverse the corporate tax cuts of 2017, which could put company earnings and stock prices under some pressure.
And, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.

While consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion, analysts wrote in a note.
My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.
And so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.
Under my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.
It was unclear how Garland's selection would be received by Black and Latino advocates who had advocated for a Black attorney general or for someone with a background in civil rights causes and criminal justice reform.

If they do not withdraw all the amount converted before the fifth tax year after the conversion, they will then be able to get earnings out tax-free, too. Because their mother died after 2019, they could choose to leave the money alone and let it grow tax-free until 2030. At the end of that year, they must empty the account, but all the money received will be tax-free.

Garland was selected over other contenders for the job including former Alabama senator Doug Jones, who lost his Senate seat last month, and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.
Garland has been on the federal appeals court in Washington since 1997. Before that, he had worked in private practice, as well as a federal prosecutor, a senior official in the Justice Department's criminal division and as the principle associate deputy attorney general.

As the table shows, the gap between the two ratios could be filled by increases in state tax revenues. To cover the gap, however, states would have to raise local taxes by an eye-watering amount — ranging from 14% in Connecticut to 26% in New Jersey.
The Dow and S&P 500 on Monday booked their sharpest daily drop in almost 10 weeks, with investors facing concerns around the potential for borrowing costs to rise, the spread of COVID-19 and the slow pace of the vaccine rollout.

Treasury yields rose for the first time in six sessions on Monday, as traders returned from a long holiday weekend to the first trading day of 2018.
Wall Street investors couldn't part ways with 2018 rapidly enough, but it turns out that 2019 is setting up to be equally ugly to stock-market bulls.
In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.

Nearly one-third of people who received a stimulus check last summer used it to pay bills and, in a Twitter poll TWTR, +1.37% of 889,000 people, over 60% said a $600 payment would not be enough to get by on. It's half of what folks got last time. Another YouGov poll said bills were the No. 1 priority for stimulus-check spending. It's alarming to look at how many Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head and pay for necessities, said the report by YouGov.

Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed.

Garland would also return to a Justice Department radically different than the one he left. The Sept. 11 attacks was years away, the department's national security division had not yet been created and a proliferation of aggressive cyber and counterintelligence threats from foreign adversaries have made counties like China, Russia and North Korea top priorities for federal law enforcement.
Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.
In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden has selected Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court, as his attorney general, two people familiar with the selection process said Wednesday.
Favorite stocks: Greifner singles out MRC Global Inc. MRC, -4.45% , a huge distributor of equipment used in energy production and industry, like pipes, valves and fitting products. The company has been cutting costs, paying down debt and repurchasing shares. Meanwhile, its customers are increasing their spending because of strength in energy and the economy. Greifner also likes Michaels Cos. MIK, -0.23% , a large arts-and-crafts retail chain. Unlike a lot of retailers, Michaels isn't beaten down by worries about competition from Amazon. But this makes sense, says Greifner, because customers like to see and touch crafts products before they buy them, to make sure they are right for the task at hand.

In short, the new federal restriction on SALT deductions will open up a new window on reforming state benefit plans with large unfunded liabilities. As voters absorb the financial implications of the new restriction, they will probably oppose tax increases and service cuts to deal with these liabilities. Instead, they will pressure elected officials to renegotiate benefit plans to the extent legally permissible.

The Federal Reserve should take no further action on interest rates for now, in order to gauge the health of the economy and get a better sense of any message being sent by weaker financial markets, says Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
I have a question about the stimulus checks. I happened to have inherited my mother's house, so if I don't qualify, that's fine. I'm working. I have a coworker who works massive amounts of overtime, and owns 10 homes, nine of which are rented. How did he get a stimulus check?

Rep. Nancy Pelosi won election as speaker of the House of Representatives on Thursday, putting the California Democrat in control of the gavel for a second time as the 116th Congress opened.
Given that you have a job and can put food on the table and a roof over your head, not qualifying for a check is something to be grateful for. We could all look at people buying televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys at Walmart WMT, -0.83% , Costco COST, +0.59% and Target TGT, -1.00% and get mad when they say, Thank God for my stimulus! But there are many more people in the supermarket using the money for food, or writing checks to their electricity company.
The big question: Will courts allow modifications of pension benefits with respect to future years of work by public employees? Historically, California has led the way in blocking such forward-looking pension changes. However, two California courts have recently allowed such changes as long as public employees still receive a substantial and reasonable pension.
If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.
Business leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.

There's a lot written about converting a traditional IRA to fund a Roth IRA, and with good reason.
If confirmed, Garland would confront immediate challenges, including an ongoing criminal tax investigation into Biden's son, Hunter, as well as calls from many Democrats to pursue inquiries into Trump after he leaves office. A special counsel investigation into the origins of the Russia probe also remains open, forcing a new attorney general to decide how to handle it and what to make public.
Yet Roth calculators can be of little use. You have to know your tax rate in the future, which is difficult to estimate. Tax rates could rise or fall, and your future income might be more or less than you expected.
Market outlook: Buckingham is an eternal optimist. But this year he's expecting no more than typical market returns of around 9%-10% for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% , driven by continued economic strength, earnings growth and benefits from tax reform. He thinks value stocks will outperform this year, after a long spell of lagging growth stocks.
We don't know what is going on with people when we look at them across the office kitchen and think, How did they get the last cup of coffee in the jar? How is that fair? I could kill for a cup of coffee. I've been looking forward to it all morning. They just had a coffee an hour ago. Maybe your colleague has a spouse at home with a serious illness, who hasn't worked in 10 years, or is swimming in debt on those 10 houses. Maybe he has a serious illness.
Buckingham also likes the pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. MRK, -0.04% , whose stock has been hit by concerns about the prospects for cancer drug Keytruda, and upcoming competition as drugs roll off patent. Those worries have knocked Merck shares down to attractive levels. It trades for around 14 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 19.
The Moneyist: I earned $100,000 in 2019, but far less in 2020. Why did I not get a stimulus check? How is that fair?
The employer's 5% match comes to 28% of your annual contribution. That is a wonderful instant return on your investment, and a very high level of downside protection, if the stock market has a bad run.

Further, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.
They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.
Adam Marshall, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said on Twitter TWTR, +1.37% that ministers need to set out a clear support package for the whole of 2021 — not just until spring — to help businesses of all shapes and sizes survive this difficult and uncertain year.
He owns around 20% of Lending Club, an online peer-to-peer lending platform. LendingClub recently tightened its lending standards, which hurt loan growth, so the company missed earnings estimates and guided down. But it still expects 15%-20% annual revenue growth over the next few years. This seems plausible given how many people with OK credit would like to refinance their credit card debt with loans. Lending Club estimates $300 billion to $350 billion in credit card debt could potentially be refinanced in this way.
The Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.
Favorite stocks: My favorite company and largest personal holding at the moment is Tellurian Inc. TELL, -7.25% , an undiscovered company that will become a big player in liquid natural gas (LNG) exports over the next few years. How do I know this? I don't, for sure. But it's a reasonably safe bet given that CEO and founder Charif Souki and his management team are responsible for creating 25% of the LNG export capacity around the globe.
Twenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.
As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.
Johnson Controls Inc. and Tyco International PLC agreed to merge, the companies said Monday, in a deal that will place the combined company's headquarters in Ireland.
Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister, was responding to Trump's warning in an interview that the country's auto makers will have to pay a 35% tax on every car imported into the U.S.
Changes like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property.

That means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of too big to fail.
Now, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.
In most divorce cases, especially in California which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. In your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). I'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. If you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (Interestingly, I told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) One more consideration: You may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.
iranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country's foreign policy. most western and middle eastern governments are also highly concerned about iran's behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty. iran's public threats to destroy america and the gulf states certainly don't help matters.
there isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. labor department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.
the u.s. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. the tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.

when it comes to a trade war, many regard trump as a risk. in a speech at the world economic forum in davos on tuesday, chinese president xi jinping lauded globalization and said no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. it wouldn't be far fetched to imagine those comments were made in response to promises from trump to slap tariffs on chinese goods to lift u.s. manufacturing.
the group's report cites a tax policy center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.

banks taking a harder look at the use of debt to buy digital assets come as bitcoin and its rivals have ballooned in popularity in recent months. the fervor around virtual coins has been compared with tulip mania, with as prominent a banker as j.p. morgan chase & co.'s ceo jamie dimon at one point describing the craze over bitcoin and its brethren as a fraud and speculative bubble that will end badly. a call to j.p. morgan about its credit-card policy toward bitcoin weren't immediately returned.

president trump on thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from haiti and african countries and said the u.s. needed more immigrants from countries like norway. on friday, trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. the president's reported comments were described as racist by rupert colville, the united nations spokesman for human rights. immigrants from poor countries come to america for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the u.s. has worsened in recent years.

nineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in january, with many raising it to $15 an hour. another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the national employment law project.
weidrich concedes that there's been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago. in addition to the falling unemployment rate (just 3% for people 55+), there are the rising stock market (until the past few days), increasing wages — up 2.9% in the past year — rising median net worth and a drop in the number of americans without health insurance (something which may change with the repeal of the affordable care act mandate).

norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. it is sometimes said that norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. by choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.

the price of a single bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 last december but has since cooled considerably amid a wave of heightened scrutiny from regulators in asia and a domestic intent to tamp down speculation. bitcoin has lost about half its value since its peak last year but is still up 1,025% since the end of 2016, while the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% is up 34% and the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% has gained 27% over the period.
some fed officials saw this as a modest risk and said that a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate might help return inflation to the fed's 2% target. but this seemed to be a minority view.
for instance, ihs markit is predicting that u.s. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. the federal reserve, the congressional budget office, the imf and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.

like many of us, the fed has no clear idea yet of what exactly is going to be implemented and to what extent it will impact economic growth, employment and inflation, said fxtm chief market strategist hussein sayed, in an emailed note. however, it has become obvious that the increase of expected interest-rate hikes in 2017 from two to three was largely based on the unknown.

my interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.

that creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. high prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. the dip in u.s. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.

washington (marketwatch) - still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the federal reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the december 15-16 meeting, released wednesday. fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. more generally, fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.

low-wage jobs are a chief reason so many low-income americans have trouble making ends meet these days, according to wiedrich.
first, iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with russian president vladimir putin. (that commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between russia and iran.) second — and more dangerous — iran's leaders believe that they have a god-given right to unite shia muslims under a single caliphate. the result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.

a few things become clear when looking at the list. one is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. a notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.

the fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. at&t, which has been trying to win support for its time warner us:twx merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like bank of america bac, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like bank of advance and flushing financial corp., ffic, +0.62% announcing them. several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.
such offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown americans often have low levels of savings. big banks including wells fargo wfc, -0.88% and bank of america bac, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a new york times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. pro baseball is getting involved, as the washington nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.

a public database has been a powerful mechanism for keeping financial predators accountable to consumers, melissa stegman, senior policy counsel at the center for responsible lending, a nonprofit based in durham, n.c., told marketwatch. pulling the complaints behind a cloak of secrecy would help let unscrupulous companies get away with mistreating consumers.
consumer advocates are also concerned that the cfpb will get rid of the database of complaints related to current investigations, which allows the public to air complaints publicly. it also provided a direct way for the public to engage with the cfpb's activities.
nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. then-sen. claire mccaskill, d-mo., in 2018 called earmarks the washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. to supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. and not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.

congressional democrats on wednesday introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
federal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that x amount of money must be spent on y project.
all in all, wiedrich said, americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said wiedrich.

the 2018 prosperity now scorecard and its report, whose bad choices? how policy precludes prosperity and what we can do about it, also make the argument that the u.s. economic system and policies of the trump administration and congress are stacked against people of color.
california, connecticut, illinois, maryland and oregon have done this; massachusetts, new jersey, vermont and washington, the prosperity now report said, are pursuing similar strategies. that could be especially helpful for low-income people; 77% of the lowest-earning workers lack access to an employer-provided retirement plan.
earmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.
pacific community ventures is a san francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in california. you need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. however, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, pcv may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements.
the incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.
the new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the u.k., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. a further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.
for earmarks to be effective tools, members might have to vote contrary to their own or their party's preferences. their willingness to do so would undoubtedly depend partly on the electoral consequences.
congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.
money managers polled by bank of america merrill lynch said the long-dollar trade is by far the most crowded right now:

gold prices bounced back from earlier losses on friday to finish modestly higher. the precious metal stretched its streak of gains to an eleventh session and tallied a weekly gain of roughly 1% as some downbeat u.s. economic data helped feed expectations for a slower federal reserve interest-rate hike policy. february gold gcg8 rose 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,322.30 an ounce, marking another finish at the highest level since mid-september. the weekly gain was also gold's fourth such rise in a row.

san antonio-based liftfund offers microloans in the southern u.s., including texas, georgia and florida. borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. the microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. liftfund got a boost in october 2016 when j.p. morgan chase & co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in new orleans, atlanta, dallas, houston, san antonio and austin, texas.
to be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of iran's government, appeals based on iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. but if rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. this would minimize the risk of severe violence in iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.
paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.
but overspending is in the eye of the beholder. at their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (discretionary spending is money over which congress has direct control, unlike social security or medicare, for example.) as a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.

the u.s showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. america's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… almost all of the policy discourse in washington, d.c. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in american society. this kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

the first item is to look at what companies have said. the grover norquist-led americans for tax reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. the benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the tax cuts and jobs act.
this year's scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low-wage occupations — ones that don't pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line. and, prosperity now's researchers say, even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 (from 9.6% to 4.5%), the rate of low-wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 (to 25.6%) and is still higher than in 2010 (when the rate was 21.5%).

at some point, the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from today's economic gains will be hardest hit, said wiedrich.
the u.s. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. in 2007, it ranked no. 3 among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries. but it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. the predominant political discourse in the united states is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the american dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. but the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist jeffrey sachs wrote in the report.

but producing oil from shale is different in an important way: the investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. this means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.

mulvaney's op-ed and recent statements have alarmed some consumer advocates. i don't think anybody in their right mind would say they believe consumers need less protecting, and who really needs help is banks, predators and financial bad actors, said karl frisch, the executive director of allied progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.
main street launch, previously known as obdc small business finance, serves clients in the san francisco bay area. it provides small-business loans of $10,000 to $250,000 that can be used for such expenses as equipment purchase, inventory or working capital.

those are findings of the survey from bank of america merrill lynch released tuesday, which has gathered up the opinions of some 176 chief investment officers, asset managers, economists and portfolio managers.
a few fed officials were also against a december interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the fomc decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.
though financial conditions had tightened and global growth had moderated, [voting] members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong, the minutes said.
we have committed to fulfill the bureau's statutory responsibilities, but go no further, he said in the new five-year strategic plan he unveiled monday. he said it should serve as a bulwark against the misuse of our unparalleled powers. mulvaney, who is also the director of the office of management and budget, and other republicans have frequently said the cfpb is too powerful.
for the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to collender. he said: you see mostly losers here. coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.
many states have already been lifting their minimum wages above the federal minimum. some 5.3 million workers started receiving higher pay starting jan. 1, according to an analysis released by the left-leaning think tank economic policy institute.
alexander arnon of the penn wharton budget model estimated in a blog post titled the price of oil is now a key driver of business investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.
grameen america is affiliated with the grameen foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. grameen america has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the u.s. the organization has a nontraditional lending system: borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. that group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business.
the minutes suggest a cautious approach to future monetary policy, said michelle meyer, head of u.s. economics at bank of america merrill lynch, in an interview on cnbc.
treasurys weakened friday, pushing the two-year yield above 2%, after a larger-than-expected rise in a key consumer-price measure underlined rising inflation expectations and dampened appetite for u.s. government paper.
at a polling station at a salvation army on bee road in savannah, election official sharon chisholm was watching a steady stream of voters and observed that the whole nation has its eyes on georgia.
here are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:
and we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the u.s. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. so i think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.
below, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. they include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the u.s. small business administration and the aspen institute, a washington, d.c.-based policy and educational research nonprofit.
'we've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years.'  — —emily martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the national women's law center
but there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward democrats than republicans. this is not entirely surprising, given that earmarks are consistent with democrats' commitment to activist government, whereas for republicans committed to minimizing the cost of government, bringing home earmarks could be painted as hypocritical.
still, the cfpb's payday lending rules were complex, amounting to more than 1,000 pages, said nick clements, the co-founder of personal finance company magnifymoney, who previously worked in the credit industry. although payday lenders can indeed cause borrowers financial distress, i do think there are some fair criticisms of the cfpb in terms of excessive complexity, he said.
what the prosperity now report doesn't mention, however, is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) and doubled the child-care tax credit (to as much as $2,000 per qualifying child). both changes stand to help low-income americans.
the account of the meeting suggest the era of a predictable and boring u.s. central bank may be over.
surveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. the new orders component of the ism manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in december. company guidance, u.s. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.
to address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% vat [value-added tax] rate, she added.
given that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. earmarks could help endangered democrats shore up their support among voters back home.
the fish rots from the head down, he wrote.
earmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.
we're now getting to the point where federal employees are going to need some kind of short-term loan in some cases, said federal budget expert stan collender.
the sba microloan program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. the sba community advantage program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital. the federal agency guarantees up to 85% of community advantage financing.
diana evans is a professor of political science at trinity college in hartford, conn. this was first published by the conversation — the 'gateway drug to corruption and overspending' is returning to congress – but are earmarks really that bad?
irregular bonuses may provide a more meaningful lift to fourth-quarter compensation per hour, but it will likely also be offset by potential individual income shifting. more significant effects from tax reform seem more likely in the next few quarters via a tighter labor market.
as political scientist david mayhew has argued, members believe that bringing home district benefits gives them something for which to claim credit, enhancing their chances for reelection and providing congressional leaders with leverage over their votes.

several fed officials noted that a faster pace of rate increases could also have implications for the fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
best and worst states in the scorecard
a few states, however, have recently adopted policies — or are working to do so — that could help low-income people on the path to prosperity.
under the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid february, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.

my own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as congress went from democratic to republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.
it's 'obvious that the increase of expected interest-rate hikes in 2017 from two to three was largely based on the unknown.'  — hussein sayed, fxtm
the u.k.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by cga and ukhospitality published in december.
while this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said kate nicholls, chief executive of trade body ukhospitality.
in cases where these employees can't turn to family or friends, companies that provide payday loans are going to benefit a little bit, because there's going to be a request for funds, said collender, known for his budget guy blog.
the new leadership has taken over at a time when consumers are struggling with credit-card, auto loan and student loan debt.
but, wiedrich is quick to add, it's still not a panacea for all.
u.s. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare
chairwoman janet yellen has said the fed would hold the balance sheet steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing treasury securities and principal payments from mortgage-backed securities until the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.
but this would hardly count as success for the protesters. after all, rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. if protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.

the gains came after minutes from the central bank's dec. 13-14 meeting out wednesday showed fed officials are grappling with considerable uncertainty about the possible impact on the u.s. economy of president-elect donald trump's fiscal stimulus plans.
in january 2017, the cfpb sued navient corp., the largest servicer of federal and private student loans in the u.s., in connection with creating obstacles for borrowers to repay their debts. the attorneys general of pennsylvania, illinois and washington have also sued navient. (a spokeswoman for navient said the cases are still pending and said no ruling has been made on the facts in any of those three states. she pointed to a lengthy company statement on the cases, which say that the allegations were unfounded.)
another staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.
but, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the iranian people with the status quo — especially their own role in it.
grantham says assets considered value, or trading at a discount based on some metric and emerging markets may be better bets in the near term. he said such bets go along with the greatest avoidance of u.s. growth stocks that your career and business risk will allow.
alston spent two weeks traveling through california, alabama, georgia, puerto rico, west virginia, and washington d.c. and spoke with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound, alston said.

in the few months since his november 2017 appointment, mulvaney has already reversed some key actions taken by his predecessor, and yet many americans may not have noticed. at least, not yet.
sunak said in november that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the covid-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.
fed officials pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, the minutes said.
now that you're nearing (or past) retirement, you think, i may move to a gated community.
while fed officials remained optimistic about the outlook, contacts in a number of fed districts were less upbeat, the minutes said.
the fed is surely betting that donald trump will be able to deliver when it comes to fiscal spending and tax reforms, but the reality may be far off what the market is positioned for, he said.
they argued that weak inflation readings allowed th central bank some latitude to wait and see how the data developed in light of the rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the minutes show.

currently, the cfpb can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, jacquot said. state attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.

the new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.
you see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. but you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn't a whole lot of transparency. nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, 'we're here.…we're more affordable.'

data compiled by the pew research center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills congress should have passed. individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.
california has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.
dennis shaul, the ceo of the community financial services association of america, a trade group that includes payday lenders, said he was pleased. the bureau's rule was crafted on a pre-determined, partisan agenda that failed to demonstrate consumer harm from small-dollar loans, ignored unbiased research and data, and relied on flawed information to support its rulemaking, he said.
despite his recent challenges calling a top, grantham is worth paying attention to due to his prescient calls over the years. he said that stocks were overvalued in 2000 and again in 2007, anticipating those market downturns, the wall street journal reports. grantham also signaled that elements of the financial market had become unmoored from reality leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis.

divide up qualified retirement plan money the tax-smart way
military deployments have a profound effect on marriage, according to a separate study published last year in the journal of population economics. it found divorce rates increased significantly when spouses spent each month away. divorce rates for military members who have been deployed are higher:it's 12.52% for those in the u.s. navy, 8.9% in the marines, 8.48% in the army and 14.6% in air force, according to armed forces health surveillance branch data.

in this column, we address one very important divorce-related tax issue: how to divide up ira and qualified retirement plan balances between you and your soon-to-be ex without triggering unexpected and unfair tax outcomes. bottom line: you need to plan ahead to make sure the federal income tax results turn out ok for you. if you don't plan ahead, the tax results can be dire. here's what you need to know to avoid that fate.
perhaps it's assumed that if you hit the magic age of retirement with the magic number in your portfolio, all will be great. the truth is that it's only a lucky few who bounce happily from one phase of life — their working years — to retirement without some feelings of displacement, loss or confusion. from my experience, it can be harder for men than women, so it's important to think about their emotional and social readiness with the same focus applied to building a financial plan.
the long-held assumption that children will be better off than their parents were appears to be faltering.
this is the dilemma you face with your fiancé. let's start with dropping the term. it doesn't mean anything, except the promise of something happening that has not happened and is unlikely to happen and, i hope, with the right support, you agree would be a disaster for you if it did happen.

on friday, biontech and pfizer said an in vitro study found that their covid-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the u.k. and south africa. the results were published on the preprint service biorxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.
however, fauci noted that people have covid-19 fatigue and a national lockdown is not feasible. i don't think this is something that we're ready for on a countrywide basis. but, you know, you have to keep your eye on everything that's going on and always keep all options open.
in that spirit, follow your gut. include them in some way, and do so equitably. if you pass away after 10 years of marriage, your wife will have rights to a widow's payments from your social security, rather than receive the lower sum from her own. your spouse is entitled to the money in your retirement account unless she signs a waiver, giving up her rights as a beneficiary.

americans are not very optimistic about their children's financial futures. only 37% of americans believe today's children will grow up to be better off than their parents were financially, a sentiment unchanged since 2013, according to a recent survey by pew research center, a nonprofit think tank in washington, d.c. it is very hard for people to thrive when health-care, housing and education costs are so high, said david grasso, the editor of genfkd, an education and economy advocacy group for millennials. those are three realities threatening the ability for present and future generations to thrive.

some people treat being single like a bad smell that won't go away. they think it's a recipe for a lifetime of misery. and were a person to be so bold as to be happy and single, balancing the two with the kind of aplomb only seen by a unicycle-riding circus juggler, they'd have science to contend with, in the form of a broad swath of studies that appear to prove that married people are happier.
here's the rub. if money from your qualified retirement plan account gets into your ex's hands without a qdro in place, you face a dire tax outcome. you'll be treated as if you received a taxable payout from the plan and then turned the money over to your ex. so, you'll owe the tax bill while your ex gets the money tax-free. to boot, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. to sum up: in the absence of a qdro, all the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you. so please make sure that your divorce agreement includes the tax-saving qdro language.

you should know what's in your own prenuptial agreement, given that it's a legal document you both signed. i don't understand why you did not have a copy when you originally signed the document, and why you didn't actively insist on a discussion. with the help of your lawyer, that was your job to make sure that happened. you had the choice to call off the wedding and/or sit down and read every page. i'm not saying this to be provocative, but to remind you that taking responsibility for this sequence of events is more constructive than taking umbrage at your husband.
well, some people complain about the lost hour of sleep (although they'll probably be back on their game within a day or so), as well as the dark mornings for early-bird commuters. and be careful: some studies show there's an uptick in morning car accidents after the switch because people aren't used to traveling in the darkness. it might even be bad for your marriage.
markle lived there while filming suits, and the couple spent the holidays in canada, reportedly at a waterfront mansion on vancouver island. as canada is part of the u.k. commonwealth, it may be required to pay for security for the couple and their son, archie. (of possible interest for other couples moving there: canadian divorce law generally splits all new marital wealth equally.)
women can carry over parts of their identity and amplify them in retirement more easily than men. a different financial services study by tiaa in 2016 found that caregiving, socializing and community service expanded to take the place of paid work when women retired, and they continued to identify as contributing to the world. men, whether married or not, tended to perceive retirement as a reward and they filled their time with sports and were more inclined to stay engaged in some aspects of their career. unfortunately over time physical limitations may affect the sports plan, and work ties can fade, so men need to consciously expand their horizons.

as i work with clients, i talk about their values and priorities as much or more than their portfolios, and these discussions can help them as individuals or couples prepare for a satisfying retirement life. i also uncover their emotions about money itself — and find for some people the mere thought of spending their wealth, rather than earning more money, creates anxiety. ideally, we are having these conversations for many years before retirement, and they are continuing afterward to support them in their experience.
as for those assets that will go through probate, such as a large sum of money in your bank account, i advise you to consult your wife, and proceed with honesty and transparency. as for your wife? even if you decide to do this quietly, it will always prey on your conscience and, if you predeceased her, she would find out after you've gone. that may leave her with many unanswered questions.

the message: when structuring your divorce settlement, consider giving your soon-to-be-ex a share (or a bigger share) of your ira and/or retirement plan money in lieu of making now-nondeductible alimony, spousal support, or spousal maintenance payments. if you follow the advice given here, your ex will owe the taxes on the ira or retirement plan money that he or she receives under the divorce agreement. tax-wise, that may be a better deal for you than making a bunch of non-deductible payments and still being on the hook for taxes on your ira and retirement plan money when you eventually take distributions.

many retirees use some form of part-time work to ease the transition, but that's a deferral, not a long-term solution. for people with ongoing board positions and charity work, there's a ready-to-go way to continue to give back when their careers end. for other people, giving back can mean stepping up to larger caregiving roles within the extended family as grandparents. the point is, having a purpose beyond yourself is important for engagement and self-esteem, and the earlier you start developing these interests — the better.
along with anti-animal cruelty, there are a myriad of other ways people can invest with their core values. religion-based investing has grown in popularity, and a new exchange-traded fund (etf) recently joined the market, and is based on the bible — it excludes companies that support abortion or support same-sex marriage. environment, social and governance (known as esg) investing looks at climate change, equal pay and executive compensation. there are also islamic-inspired funds that exclude anything to do with alcohol, tobacco and gambling, said david kathman, a mutual fund analyst at chicago-based investment research and management firm morningstar.
california is a no-fault state, meaning that you can get divorced for pretty much any reason you want. irreconcilable differences is commonly listed on a divorce petition in california. another reason: incurable insanity. in such a case, let's assume that you would be listing your spouse's incurable insanity and not your own. in other words, you might have one affair or a dozen, but a no-fault divorce means a faster and easier divorce for both of you. the judge will only be concerned that the marriage is over, and he or she is unlikely to care who is at fault.

to divide up qualified retirement plan accounts the tax-smart way in a divorce, you need to establish a qualified domestic relations order, or qdro. a qdro is boilerplate language that should be included in your divorce papers. first and foremost, the qdro establishes your soon-to-be-ex's legal right to receive a designated percentage of your qualified retirement plan account balance or designated benefit payments from your plan. the good news for you is that the qdro also ensures that your ex, and not you, will be responsible for the related income taxes when he or she receives payouts from the plan.

you may not like your mother-in-law or brother-in-law, she said, but sometimes you just have to take one for the team. that's an important part of being in a couple, she added. still, in that scenario, it's important to make sure your spouse reciprocates, she said.
the audience wrote questions on cards for daniels to answer. one person asked if there was any chemistry between her and her former lawyer, michael avenatti, who has been charged in a 36-count federal indictment alleging he stole millions of dollars from clients, did not pay his taxes, committed bank fraud and lied in bankruptcy proceedings.

sadly, huddleston says, many of us in our 50s and 60s are having the same kind of unhelpful talk with our parents about their finances. she notes in her book that a gobankingrates survey found that 73% of adults haven't had detailed conversations with their parents about their finances. and that, the award-winning personal finance journalist maintains, is a giant problem for both generations.

in other words, increased transparency appeared to decrease the gender-pay gap in the short term by nudging employers to pay female employees more money so they would earn equal pay for equal work. any gap in pay, regardless of gender, was used as leverage when they negotiated their salaries. but sharing information on salaries over the long term may have led employers to lower overall salaries rather than lifting women's salaries to the level of their male co-workers, the study suggests.

single people are also more connected to other people than married people, have more friends and value meaningful work more. even if you could employ the gold standard of scientific research to study this subject, randomly assigning married or single life to people, depaulo said she believes it would be impossible to examine objectively. that's because of what she calls singlism and matrimania — the narrative favoring wedded bliss over perceived sad singledom.

our idea of a fun night out was the special at the local chinese restaurant, while they clubbed it in the city. indeed, their combined income was twice ours — probably more — and we had unemployment setbacks. but we never suffered relationship problems with the so-called wealth gap as so many friends do. while out for an evening together we split bills evenly, treated or were treated. it worked.

self-employment in america now rises sharply with age, especially after 65, the nber researchers noted in their report. while just under 20% of workers age 18 to 49 are self-employed, 25% of those 55 to 59 are, 46% of those 65 to 69 are and 68% of those 75 to 79 are. self-employment among older workers is a lot more common than we think it is, said hershbein, a senior economist at the w.e. upjohn institute for employment research and one of the paper's authors.

there are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. but that's largely a myth, experts say. it is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said greg vigrass, president and chief executive of folio institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. it is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the s&p 500 and others do not.

high-end cards like the sapphire reserve and amex platinum charge hundreds of dollars a year to carry them, but often give out a large number of reward points initially. despite such high fees, consumers may also have a hard time spending all those rewards to make those cards worth it. if every sapphire reserve card user's spending qualified for the 100,000 point sign-up bonus — which was later reduced to 50,000 points — they'd have around 91 billion points to spend, an equivalent of more than $1 billion, the personal-finance website nerdwallet calculated.
markle flew back to canada earlier this month amid reports she was driven out by, among other things, press coverage regarded as both overtly and covertly racist. highlighting 20 headlines, buzzfeed pointed to the different standards used to report on kate middleton — wife of prince william, second in line to the british throne — and markle, from child-rearing to eating avocado.
courts want to minimize the impact of divorce on the couple's children, so often this means the custodial spouse will retain use of the marital residence, says ailion.
nationally, women earn 83% that of men, according to the pew research center in washington, d.c. in the 1970s, women were paid closer to 58% the salary of men. men and women acquire more experience the longer they work and, therefore, become more valuable and productive. after 50, however, they either slow down and learn fewer new skills, economists say, or they are competing with younger, less expensive but equally skilled, employees for the same jobs.

just because you've set expectations doesn't mean you can't make exceptions. one major reason to alter your routine would be if your financial fortunes shift, said swann.
while the couple's break for the border releases them from the drab ribbon-cutting, handshaking daily duties of royal life in the u.k., and should better shield themselves from the jaundiced coverage they have received at the hands of the british tabloids, their bid for financial independence is somewhat more complicated and will not require them to take up full-time jobs.

you never did ask your friends what went wrong. they may not give you an honest answer, but you may feel better by acknowledging that this friendship has come a cropper. they may be genuinely struggling financially and, while that must be hard for them to deal with, they — and they alone — bear the sole responsibility for that. some people will only be around for the good times. others will relish the bad times. but true friends will celebrate and commiserate, and be there for both.

this fixer-upper ranch home isn't exactly posh, but it's directly next door to the couple's hidden hills compound, bringing their total property ownership in this area to 8 acres. they bought it in 2019 for $3 million and apparently had plans to create a guest compound here and live off the land, growing organic vegetables and fruit.

they were living well, and they were also comfortable with you and your wife living, well, not quite in the same fashion. but you were a-ok with that. and you're right. you can have just as much fun camping as you can have in europe staying at a five-star hotel. more, in fact. plus, you can enjoy a home that was lovingly renovated over time with the sweat from your own brow as much, if not more, than if you had hired contractors to turn it into a marble-encrusted suburban palace.
the queen acknowledged the difficulties in her statement saturday: i recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life, her statement read, adding, it is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.
for example, one billionaire couple that lenz's firm worked with had a $10 million prenup, but the ex-wife was able to get a $60 million settlement to secure her signature — which included two homes and seed money to start her new business venture.
however, most prenup terms well exceed the final settlement in order to get a signoff on the divorce, and the properties are divvied up to avoid the appearance of a fire sale, she says.

we've only just begun our journey of balancing parenthood and financial goals, but it's been a real crash course, especially now that we have two kids under the age of 3. here are some lessons we've learned so far.
the men recalled a white house visit, which included springsteen playing the piano as broadway and motown tunes were sung. there were libations involved, obama said.
this happened following a conversation i instigated and in which i suggested we see an attorney to have a will drawn up, in case one of us passes away. the house is appreciating in value daily due to its location (it's worth $50,000 more already) and he wants his children to inherit it. he wants me to pay rent, which essentially leaves nothing for my children.
there's a real temptation to buy all the baby things—especially on birthdays and around the holidays. but as my first kid's closet filled up and our storage space overflowed with toys, i hit the pause button to redefine what was a necessity, what was extra and where our money would have the highest impact.
this house should be a source of peace and contentment for you, not one that creates ongoing anxiety. it's not your job to fix everybody. it's not your job to split your estate according to your children's wishes. it's not your job to make everything right for everybody all the time. this is your moment. do not give up your happiness to the ill-winds of other people's wishes, wants and what-ifs.
there's something extra special about the holiday season when you're a parent, watching your kids excitedly open presents and enjoy quality time with extended family. but, of course, that's just half the story. on the other side of that coin is the financial stress of having to buy those gifts and coordinate travel to meet that extended family.

there's one real-world drawback: consumers may use the platinum card in social situations when they're better off using a less prestigious card. it can be a costly mistake, the study found. while the card used in our study does not offer cash back rewards, at least 48% of platinum customers report owning other credit cards which do offer cash back at restaurants and similar transactions. in order to appear wealthier, in other words, customers may actually forgo money in the form of cash rewards each time they use the platinum card instead of other cards in those situations.

these connections are one reason that in my house, and among my friends, it's the wife's role to manage the family social life. as couples move into their 50s and begin thinking about retirement, this imbalance of connections is something that can cause big problems ahead. according to a 2015 pew research study, not only has the divorce rate among people over 50 doubled since 1990, over 66% of those divorces are initiated by the wives. women are not only more financially independent, they have the support network making the single life look attractive.

my boyfriend does not want to leave this home should i pass away, but he also says the house should go to my kids since it is their family home. of course, i hope to live long enough that all the kids are grown and settled, in which case i can make a new will.
but why put all your focus on ensuring that this man does not inherit your home? i agree that you should do everything in your power to make that happen, but you could have another 10 or 20 or more years left, so why suffer because your husband is unable or unwilling to kick him out? you do not have to live with abuse. there is no excuse for abuse. it is time to end your stepson's rent-free rule of terror in your home. you have a right to live safely and happily.

your prenuptial agreement should reflect that you both maintain your separate finances and assets in the event you divorce. in other words, what's his is his and what's yours is yours. he can't have it both ways. according to rowe law offices, historically, courts sometimes set aside premarital agreements when they were unreasonable; left one spouse destitute; were made without full disclosure of a spouse's property and debt; were signed under duress or without mental capacity; were the product of fraud or misrepresentation; and so on.

when deciding where you're going to spend each holiday, it's important to consider whether a given celebration, say christmas eve, is more important to one partner than the other. that's kind of a compromise in itself, said swann. if one celebration is very important to both families, then couples either have to rotate or find a way to be with both sets of relatives.

but because that lumps people whose relationships ended presumably because they weren't happy, the results grossly misrepresented the actual story, depaulo said, making married people look better and single people look worse. in the long term, married couples — though there was a short-lived honeymoon effect right after they got hitched — weren't any happier on average years into marriage than they had been when single, depaulo found.

you need an outside voice, preferably a financial adviser, to outline your mother's financial situation and goals as she faces a life without her husband. it would make a nice new year's gift, and you could pitch it as a way of putting your and your mother's minds at ease. the adviser would then form an opinion on your sister's role in your mother's life and finances. your mother would not suspect the adviser of being anything other than objective.

you may have already noticed that it's staying lighter later, thanks to the normal course of the earth's movements in relation to the sun, but daylight-saving time turbocharges this process. of course, no daylight is actually being saved. we're just moving an hour of daylight to later in the day — so, for example, on march 10 when the clock reads 6 p.m., it will look pretty much as bright as it was at 5 p.m. the day before. by the time june is here, we'll be able to enjoy the twilight well into the evening.

younger americans also face a host of financial constraints that previous generations didn't. millennials have a reputation for delaying marriage and homebuying and living at home with their parents for longer than any generation before them, but there's more to it: there's an increasing number of young people who are staying home to help their parents or save for a down payment on a house. but younger americans' lack of worry about the future also means they're saving less for retirement.
dr. anthony fauci told americans on thursday to brace for more infections and deaths from covid-19.
baby boomers in particular have seen divorce rates double in the last 25 years, a pew research center report found, increasing 109% since 1990 as people are living longer and the cultural and religious stigma of divorce has declined in recent years. gray divorcées tend to be less financially secure than married and widowed adults, particularly among women, pew said. and living alone at older ages can be detrimental to one's financial comfort.
harry, 35, on the other hand, inherited a sizable fortune after the death of his mother. he inherited approximately 7 million british pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the bbc estimated. his father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.
indeed, in a july new york times survey, about a quarter of millennials said they'll have fewer children than they'd hoped because of the high costs associated with parenthood.

the sussexes rely on prince charles — first in line to the british throne — for approximately 95% of their income. prince charles earns $23 million a year from the duchy of cornwall, a private estate with more than $1.3 billion in assets. the duchy's financial accounts reveal a total income for fiscal 2017 of 37.2 million british pounds ($48.7 million), up 2.5% on the previous year.

last week, the couple announced they work to become financially independent and live between u.k. and north america. free from the ribbon-cutting duties of royal life, the duke and duchess of sussex are on the brink of becoming a global-media power couple, with or without their royal titles. their instagram fb, +2.02% account has 10.9 million followers, adding 700,000 in one week.
if they did live beyond their means and live a lifestyle to which they hoped to become accustomed — and they can't blame you or their financial adviser for their credit-card debt — it suggests that they may not be 100% happy in their own skin. when people are unhappy and they have a brief respite from those emotions when they buy a smart tv or a face cream that promises to make them look 10 years younger, it might not feel so bad to have friends who do not have access to those luxuries.
notably, before any of this happened, i had ordered my ex the latest 128-gigabyte iphone 7. i was advised to cancel this order because it sends mixed signals if my wish is to cease communication with him. there is a part of me that feels i should inform my ex that i have canceled the order, so he can make arrangements to get the new phone if he so desires. however, i am afraid of triggering him to disclose these details of my life; given his recent behavior towards me, does this courtesy go out with the bath water?

older americans are much more pessimistic than younger ones — 61% of americans 50 and older say the next generation is in trouble. among 18- to 29-year-olds, less than half (49%) believe even younger americans will be worse off. older americans in particular may have trouble envisioning a future free from a housing market that would have been out of reach to them in their 20s and 30s, stagnant wage growth and student debt that has tripled to $1.3 trillion from $481 billion a decade ago, grasso said. not to mention modern society's obsession with smartphones.
pearson believes markle is the driving force to break free from the house of windsor, suggesting that — despite the privileges of royal life — the negative press coverage was too much to bear. she had no idea how un-glamorous it really is to be a royal and, when she found out she would be a civil servant in a tiara she was, like, 'no way.' the couple's website is similar in tone to obama.org.

you can't control how other people will feel after you make a decision. there is a great freedom to be had in making decisions that you believe are right for you, and allowing others to feel as they are going to feel. some people will be mad at you in this life, others will try to bend you to their will, and some will sit in the lawyer's office while your last will and testament is being read out, and will curse you from the other side.
he says he believes the best way for americans to defend the constitution would be to boycott the offending states.
i am very concerned with treating everyone fairly. the last thing i want when i die is for one of my kids (or my boyfriend) to feel as if i didn't love them because of how i divide things. please help!

even if negotiating the holidays is a conversation we all dread, couples should try to get to it as soon as possible, experts say. though it can be awkward to talk christmas in july, couples may be happier with their plans if they discuss them while the weather is warm — before other family members' plans have a chance to influence their own, said sharon naylor, the author of more than 35 wedding and celebration books.

marriage rates have dropped over the decades while unmarried cohabitation is on the rise, which is something borne out in national health statistics reports and the pew research center.
my fiancé — or should i say eternal fiancé because he never wants to get married — recently shocked me when he flatly stated that he wants me off the mortgage and deed to our newly purchased waterfront home. we have lived there for a year and pay 50/50 on everything. he didn't want to debate or talk about buying me out, he was more insistent and will not budge.
and you're not the first couple who walked into divorce court after having multiple affairs. adultery is often a symptom rather than the cause of a breakdown in a relationship. around one in four married people will admit to having engaged in sexual infidelity, justin lehmiller, a purdue university psychologist and author of the psychology of human sexuality, told the wall street journal last year. it also shows that happy, faithful marriages are, at best, the norm and, at worst, at least possible.

it could be that your parents didn't save enough for retirement. you may need to encourage them to move somewhere smaller, more manageable and more affordable.
caring too much about what people think of you while you're here is exhausting enough. worrying about how they will feel about you after you're gone is an unheavenly form of co-dependency that only serves to muddle your financial decisions now and later. after all, you'll be gone, so you won't have to worry about it! you want to make sure your loved ones are taken care of, of course, but do what you believe is right, not what others tell you to do.
it can be helpful to set a routine where you either alternate holidays or spend a certain holiday with a certain set of relatives each year. that way you manage relatives' expectations, so that you don't have to have the same conversation every time certain holidays roll around, said swann.
daniels said the sex scandal that propelled her into the spotlight has no relationship to #metoo. she has always made clear that her alleged affair was consensual, but said the movement has made dating more fraught for men. i have to buy my own drinks now. people approach me less, probably because i have a very large man standing next to me, she said, citing her security detail. but she has no beef with men, in general. i don't think men are monsters, daniels said.
certainly, some parents will resist having them. but i would say a majority of parents will come around if you let them know that you want to have the conversation because you're looking out for their best interest.
also, comento added, as a solo ager with no family near her, my social interaction is through my business. i love talking to people and helping people. when the money comes in, that's nice as well.
memories came flooding back. bad ones. summer vacations when he didn't return my calls. reminders that he had more money, a recurring topic. recalling those experiences led me to feel bad for my younger self. it wasn't that he had changed, it was that he had not changed. he was the same. that high status/low status was the dynamic of our childhood friendship. i was so happy to have a friend back then that i put up with it. in 2001, however, one night was enough.

investing isn't all about the nuances of stocks and bonds and the twists and turns of the market — sometimes, it involves matters of the heart. on monday, ubs announced it had raised $325 million for the rise fund, which was co-founded by bono and hopes to combine financial returns and support a range of social and environmental causes. the fund's total size is $2 billion and is managed by bill mcglashan, founder and managing partner of tpg growth, reuters reports. its investments include everfi, a provider of subscription-based digital learning to k-12 schools, universities, corporations, sports teams and ngos, and dodla, an indian dairy business.
it's unlikely that your sister will, upon hearing your opinion, suddenly start paying her way. she will accept money from your mother as long as your mother gives it to her. it's hard to undo such an arrangement. when someone is used to being given special or preferential treatment, they often believe that this is their due. the more pressure you put on both of them, the more defensive they are likely to become.
did he need you to co-sign this mortgage, or is this just a random change of heart? either way, stop calling him your fiancé for the purposes of this dilemma, and just view him as another human being who is offering you a bad deal, and using emotion to get it over the line.
to be fair, harry also reportedly earned an annual salary of $45,000 when he served as an officer in the army air corps and approximately $52,000 a year while working as a helicopter pilot for the army air corps, according to separate estimates by forbes and fortune magazines based on publicly available figures for salaries in the u.k. army.

before the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), you could deduct properly structured alimony payments made to your ex, and your ex had to include the payments in his or her taxable income. but the tcja permanently eliminated deductions for alimony payments required by post-2018 divorce agreements. these payments may also be called spousal support or spousal maintenance. whatever they are called, you can't deduct them anymore under the federal income tax rules, and your ex receives these payments federal-income-tax-free.
if they say: 'it's none of your business,' you can respectfully respond: 'it could be some of my business one day if you ever need my help. and as your child, i want to be able to help you. i want to care for you in the same way you cared for me when i was growing up. i feel i owe it to you.'

using administrative data covering the universe of faculty in canada, they came to three conclusions: firstly, the laws reduced the gender-pay gap. that's good news for a persistent problem that has dogged generations of workers. secondly, the closure of the gender wage gap occurred primarily in universities where faculty are unionized. that's a wrinkle in how widely this study may be applied. thirdly, pay disclosures ultimately reduced all salaries on average.

to be honest, we hadn't given this much thought. over the course of our relationship we'd opted to spend thanksgiving separately, even as we tried to rotate where we celebrated various jewish holidays. but if a practical reason meant a change in routine, we didn't give it too much thought.
the older self-employed aren't always what you might think of as traditional small-business owners, running brick-and-mortar enterprises. often, as the nber economists learned after conducting a gallup survey of 61,000 americans, they're independent contractors working from home.

these conversations can't wait. and as difficult as they might seem, the consequences of not having them can be far worse.
talk that santander's u-turn on appointing andrea orcel, the former head of ubs's investment bank, as ceo was due to a potential populist uprising in spain over the size of his pay packet, and less to do with reservations over the italian dealmaker's modus operandi, is looking cheap after the elitist adventures of ana botín, the spanish retail bank's chair. in the same week that santander announced it was closing 140 branches in the uk, botín attended the institute of international finance meeting in zurich and was then on stage at the world economic forum's annual meeting in davos alongside assorted politicos. given santander's recent woes of late, it seemed fitting that botín found herself at the davos forum having to mediate a contentious exchange between dutch prime minister mark rutte and former european parliament president martin schulz.

should you amend the prenup? you can certainly create an amendment, as long as both of you are in agreement, or sign a new postnuptial contract that supersedes the original contract. but that is a question only you can answer based on what the prenup actually says, and whether your lawyer believes it is written in a way that gives you both the same financial independence post-divorce. the whole business seems messy and unpleasant. it was not a good way to embark on a marriage and, as a tangent to your question, it's not a good way to continue one.
the qdro arrangement also permits your ex-spouse to withdraw his or her share of the retirement plan money and roll it over tax-free into an ira (assuming the plan permits such a withdrawal). that way, your ex can take over management of the money while postponing income taxes until distributions are taken from the rollover ira.
what happens if money from your ira gets into your ex's hands — before or after the divorce — without such a requirement? you'll be treated as if you received the ira money in a taxable distribution and then gave the money to your ex. that means you'll be on the hook for the income tax bill from the deemed taxable distribution — even though your ex wound up with all the money. to add insult to injury, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. your ex won't have any complaints, because the money from your ira is received without any tax consequences for your ex. all the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you.

the forthcoming divorce of amazon founder jeff bezos, the world's richest man, from his wife mackenzie after 25 years of marriage has yet to play out. but when the possessions are divvied up, bezos will surely walk away with the family copy of booker prize-winning novel the remains of the day. it is bezos's favorite novel of all time and he once said of the tome, which recounts the exploits of a dutiful butler in the mid-2oth century: before reading it, i didn't think a perfect novel was possible. so bezos might not like to hear that author kazuo ishiguro has told capital that his 2005 dystopian novel never let me go has recently overtaken the remains of the day in sales. mackenzie bezos once posted a scathing one-star amazon review of bezos biographer brad stone's book the everything store, in which he claimed the remains of the day inspired bezos to create amazon. it isn't true, she wrote. jeff didn't read the remains of the day until a year after he started amazon. halcyon days!

meanwhile, the prevalence of celebrities attending the wef annual meeting has been much discussed, and there's no doubt that the most star-studded haunt was at davos house. the event space partnered with organizations including red, bono's aids initiative, children's charity unicef and conservation organization wwf in an effort to raise awareness about the u.n.'s 2030 sustainable development goals, and the likes of bill gates, matt damon, john kerry and david attenborough dropped by. capital hears former treasury pals matt hancock and george osborne, now health secretary and evening standard editor respectively, also made an appearance in davos house at the same time daredevil magician david blaine was there showing off his tricks. given blaine's previous stunts include spending 44 days suspended in a glass box by the thames, the political pair — both of whom have been wringing their hands over brexit — could have been forgiven for begging the illusionist to try to pull an eu-related rabbit out of a hat.

if you have even a few years to ready yourself for retirement, here are three important considerations and ideas for action plans to improve your transition:
gallagher calls his new life a marriage of two of my passions: photography and making the world a better place through nonprofit and volunteer work.
our beloved internal revenue code allows divorcing couples to divide up ira balances without adverse federal income tax consequences. say you'll be transferring ira money to your soon-to-be-ex as part of the divorce settlement. you should arrange for a tax-free transfer of money from your ira into an ira set up in your ex's name. do this via a direct transfer (aka trustee-to-trustee transfer) from your ira into your ex's receiving ira. that way, the transferred funds never pass through your hands, which is what makes it a tax-free deal for you.
don't miss:will a flip phone give other people the wrong impression?
you need a third party to intervene who does not have a horse in this race.
after the transfer, your ex can manage the receiving ira and defer taxes until he or she begins taking money out of the account.
contact georgia adult protective services to report abuse, and find an organization that can help you navigate the last years of your life so they are free from harassment and abuse. talk to a lawyer, financial planner, therapist, doctor and even the police if you have to. you didn't sign up for this when you married and the price you paid should not have been a peaceful life. if your husband stands by and allows this to happen, he is helping to facilitate your stepson's abusive behavior.
nearly half of women who have abortions live below the federal poverty level
we stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, and enjoyed our lives.
in our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser. we accepted and had a great time. well, they did poke fun at us for participating too much on their dime. it was a good experience, and my spouse and i took it to heart and so did our friends, or so we thought.
what's more, the lower your self-esteem, the more likely you will opt for flashy credit cards with higher fees. social image is a substitute for self-image, the researchers wrote. demand for status is psychological in nature. cross-referencing spending habits with psychological tests, the researchers found that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. (the study was carried out by economists from the university of chicago, the world bank, sao paulo school of economics, harvard university and university of california, los angeles.)
like many of my fellow cohabitating millennials, i was relatively naive about the realities of getting married. i assumed not a ton would change between my now-husband and me once we made it official.
during these conversations, partners should remember that while their family is important the feelings of the couple are paramount when determining their plans, said gottsman. it really is first and foremost about the couple and respecting each other, she said. that's not to say that you don't take your family into consideration, but often times we [go somewhere] for the family and we end up resenting it.
tonya garcia tells the story of how olive garden, one of several restaurant chains run by darden restaurants inc. dri, +0.00% , has boosted sales by emphasizing takeout convenience and by giving people what they want — pasta with pepperoni.
cameron huddleston, author of mom and dad, we need to talk: how to have essential conversations with your parents about their finances, remembers the birds-and-the-bees talk she had as a child with her mother. huddleston says she'd give her mom a d at best because the talk was a single sentence saying that a man and woman lie together and make love.
in the end, you can have anything, but you can't have everything
some things always seem to signal the change from winter to spring. the first crocus. the sound of birds chirping. turning the clocks ahead an hour.
her life has changed since the wall street journal revealed in january 2018 that cohen paid daniels $130,000 in october 2016, a month before the u.s. presidential election, to stop her from talking about her alleged affair with trump. cohen started a three-year sentence on monday for tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations related to those hush-money payments. she was delighted that the man who arranged those payments is now in jail.
'i'm angry at myself now because there are provisions i would have included had i had more time to think about it.'
late into the evening, and too many pints of guinness later, he asked me in a slow, slurring drawl: do you mind me asking, 'how much did you pay for your apartment?' again, i told him. he could do all the calculations he wanted to, but it was no skin off my nose. my friends have been, and always will be, the most valuable thing in my life. but at that moment it finally hit me: a childhood friendship i had encased in a special snow globe of my mind was, like this evening, actually difficult to endure.
budweiser takes female empowerment very seriously, beyond leading in advertising and reflecting culture, a spokesman said, noting that over 80% of the company's brand team was female. nearly half of our us breweries are led by female head brewmasters, who play a crucial role in brewing our best-known products. as an advertising leader, it is our responsibility to equally represent and celebrate culture, including championing women.

eventually, my mother is set to inherit my grandmother's house, where she currently lives and pays monthly rent of $2,500 to my grandmother, but i am uncertain when that will happen (possibly in about five years or longer, depending on my grandmother's health).
one of the things that has become really important to me is to never have to do the things i hated doing, says vanderburg. i didn't want to manage staff or operate according to any schedule outside of my own or deal with administrative stuff or work with people i didn't want to work with.
spotify spot, -0.47% has moved aggressively in podcasts over the past three years, and made other programming announcements monday. the audio streaming service has already worked with barack and michelle obama's production company higher ground, and the former first lady's podcast is the service's most popular original.
brett arends believes donald trump could have gotten ahead of the story of how his business benefitted from u.s. tax law and used it to make the case for tax reform.
that's something that has to be clearly described so they can hear the inflection in your voice, said naylor. couples should be very direct with their families about their plans, she said. they should also be sure to respond to any invitations, even if that means saying we haven't decided yet, so that the host can plan appropriately.
9. this might be a better target for disney
that will be a really interesting question, said hershbein. my sense is that people who are employees now will probably be reluctant to retire or quit if they can keep their job. but quite possibly, for those who are 65+ who were working and got the news of possibly being laid off, rather than waiting for that, they might think, 'now's the time' [to retire]. that's more 'i see the writing on the wall.'
jennifer lenz, a real estate agent at dolly lenz real estate in new york city, has been privy to many high-profile splits and shares that divorce settlement details typically hinge on the prenups and other contractual obligations that were in place before the marriage.
we arranged to meet for dinner in a restaurant in dublin. when i arrived, he said, why don't you sit down there — and relax. why was he telling me to relax? i was relaxed! now i wasn't feeling so relaxed! the evening started with that weird, condescending tone, and it went downhill from there. he asked a lot of questions, which soon took on a common theme. all roads led back to money, money, money: where do you live? how many bedrooms do you have?
the wyoming property will go to kanye as this is where he plans to build his technology, design, and innovation epicenter, says stewart.

as a millennial with a mortgage, student debt and a fluctuating income, i can relate to that stress—but it didn't stop me from starting a family nearly three years ago. while it may not make financial sense, my husband and i make it work. because, like anything worth having, some sacrifices are necessary in the pursuit of bigger dreams.
when you have the conversation, don't put so much focus on the fact that you won't be there, she said. make that part matter of fact — talk to them about what you will do.
one is saying: 'i understand you don't want to talk about finances now, but let's think about situations when you would be willing to share some information and you might need some help.' maybe it's when one parent has a health issue, if dad passes away and mom's left alone. ask them to identify those moments and write down situations when it might be ok to step in. help make that list and hang onto it. and then when the time comes, come back and say: 'we agreed we would talk.'
everything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future
approximately one in four people aged 65 years old will live beyond 90, and one out of 10 will live past 95, according to the social security administration; more than half of those who reach the age of 65 will require some form of long-term care. you don't want to be in a position where both your health and the health of your husband have declined to such a degree that you are dependent and at the mercy of your stepson. unless you force your stepson to move out, he will never leave.
fauci has previously warned that americans are facing a dark time and the potential surge over the holidays could lead to a dark january, this may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday, he told cnn last month. infections have exceeded 89.2 million worldwide.
sharing pay data is probably the easiest way to ensure every employee gets the same pay for the same job. but new research suggests that employers may claw back those gains made by underpaid staff over time. economists from the university of toronto, princeton university and the social analysis and modelling division from statistics canada, the country's national statistics agency, examined the impact of public-sector salary disclosure laws on university faculty salaries.
though happily single herself, depaulo doesn't think everyone else needs to be single to be happy — but that's true of married or partnered people too, she said. embracing this idea, though, renders all the research about marrieds and singles alike meaningless, she said. at best, the quest for a universal truth about partnership will only capture the average experience. science will never tell you that marriage is the right decision, or that walking down the aisle was a horrible mistake.
previous research on pay transparency found that people were more concerned with pay ranks than differences pay levels. workers earning below the median for their pay unit and occupation reported lower pay and job satisfaction, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction, it found. workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction, it added, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction.
include her in the conversation and on the amount you decide to leave them. if you don't, that would defeat the purpose of doing this good deed in the first instance. preface any discussion by telling your wife that she need not worry about her own financial security. she may or may not agree, but i'm betting that your transparency and open heart is what drew her to you in the first place.
markle acknowledged that she had a difficult time adapting to life with the often critical media attention in the u.k. i've really tried to adopt this british sensibility of a stiff upper lip. i've tried, i've really tried, i think that what that does internally is probably really damaging, she said. the biggest thing that i know is that i never thought this would be easy, but i thought it would be fair.
it is truly abhorrent that he would even think about disclosing personal details about your life. don't dignify this intimidation by paying $749 for his iphone 7. if you do, you are living in the shadow of his threat. to break free from this relationship, cancel the iphone order (if you still can) and do something really nice with that money. if it involves sitting on a beach with a cocktail, raise your glass to the universe to give thanks for this experience. (here's a five-night all-inclusive vacation in cancun for $749 exactly.) you may not know it now, but you have probably learned a great deal.
west's plans for this compound apparently include a 10-bedroom, 52,000 square-foot mansion and two 10,000-square-foot underground garages, which will likely run him into the $50 million range, according to real estate experts.
let me introduce you to the sunk cost fallacy.
shares of twitter inc. twtr, -1.24% rose 35% from sept. 19 through oct. 4 amid reports of a possible bidding war for the social-media company by alphabet inc. goog, -1.25% , apple inc. aapl, -2.32% , walt disney co. dis, -1.29% and salesforce.com inc. crm, -1.75% . but everything changed thursday, as takeover rumors were deflated and twitter's stock fell 20%. barbara kollmeyer and caitlin huston consider how much further twitter's stock might drop before a takeout.
the adult-film star, director and author of the 2018 memoir, full disclosure, kicked off the first leg of her nationwide storytelling tour, an intimate evening with stormy daniels, on tuesday evening at stand up ny, a small comedy club on manhattan's upper west side. she talked about her life and answered audience questions about topics ranging from donald trump, his former personal attorney michael cohen and her former lawyer michael avenatti.
the second question i have is how to deal with a promise ring. it was given to me last christmas. i looked up the price of the ring and its listed retail price is $400 and is selling for $250. i have absolutely no problems giving the ring back — nor has he asked for it — but i am trying to do the right thing if somehow a promise was unfulfilled.
many companies are grappling with the predominance of men at the top of the ladder. a study last year from mckinsey & company and leanin.org showed patterns across all sorts of industries: an ever-shrinking number of women the higher in a company.
i got married at 20, so there was no urgency to rush into parenthood. instead, we spent the first years of marriage finishing college, enjoying (a little) disposable income and buying a house. but did we manage to check everything off our financial to-do list before having our first kid? not even close.
should i amend the prenuptial agreement? is it possible that the current prenuptial agreement is null and void?
the gender pay gap was around 15% in 1970 and reduced to 4% to 5% in 2017. the study looked at 101,103 individual university employees across canada. individuals were on average 48 years old and one quarter of them were women. the women in the sample were nearly 10% more likely to be unionized than men; this may be because they're more likely to work at organizations where there are labor unions and/or the share of women increased in the workforce alongside the gradual increase in unionization in the 1970s.

in the case with kardashian west and west, however, money like this is probably no big object. kardashian west is the richest of her famous family, and the couple's combined wealth exceeds $3 billion, which means dividing the properties they share might take on more meaning.

given that 57% of workers plan to work full time or part time in retirement, according to a new transamerica center for retirement studies survey, what will the pandemic mean for self-employment and independent contractor work for people 65+?
certainly, something needs to change. from the little you have said, it appears to be a marriage that lacks transparency and mutual respect. you need a financial therapist, a mediator or your own counselor to examine the causes and cures of this toxic atmosphere. starting a business should be a time of optimism and joy, not steeped in an i'll show you entrepreneurial revenge fantasy. getting married is the biggest financial decision you will make in your life, if only because of the toll divorce takes on an individual, and because you may end up taking turns supporting each other.
ask yourself, what identifies you today? how important is that career to your sense of belonging in the world? i had a long stage of life where my identity was completely wrapped up in getting ahead — at an ivy league school, at work in a big investment company. but karma intervened, and life got complicated with marriage, children, some family illnesses and i had to step out of my comfort zone and, as they say, get a life.
i wouldn't point out that your parents are making mistakes. put yourself in your parent's shoes and consider how you want your own children talking to you. you need to be respectful.

in normal circumstances, i'd work 20 hours a week on my photography business, said gallagher. in the pandemic, it's more like 10 hours.
the first two episodes of renegades: born in the usa, a conversation recorded at springsteen's guitar-filled home studio in new jersey, were made available on monday.
lane fox reckons that studies back her gloomy gender prognosis.we're not making progress, she laments. i am an optimist, but i think we have to be realistic. mckinsey did some work to show when there's going to be gender parity across various different [sectors]… politics was going to be about 75 years. awful, but you can imagine i might still be alive if i take the right drugs and put the right face cream on. business, i think a bit less, maybe 50 years. but then in stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] or anything to do with technology, never — because the trajectory's either flat or backwards… but it doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on it relentlessly.
more than 40% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would make them think twice about dating that person. women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). credit scores also reveal an individual's relationship skill, trustworthiness and level of commitment, a 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c.
my mother's only income is equal to her housing expenses, so she will need to rely on her savings to pay her bills of about $1,500 to $2,000 a month. they are high, mainly because she pays for my 23-year-old sister's bills,which amount to $500 to $600 per month.
what did i learn from that? if someone is no longer in your life, it could be for a good reason. it's ok to have a smaller home or less money than everyone else, so drive up to that school reunion bursting with pride in your old jalopy! listen to how you feel, and take action. when you are spending time with neighbors or old school buddies who are not healthy for you, you are taking time away from yourself, and from days and nights spent with others. time is infinitely more valuable than money.
the researchers said it's possible that the gender wage gap is unaffected by transparency laws. while learning about co-workers' wages might reveal something about the nature of firm-specific rents, if men and women use this information in a symmetric fashion in bargaining, one should not expect to see any impact on the gender pay gap. put simply: if men, but not women, use the information in bargaining, it could exacerbate the gap.
men, women and couples who prepare themselves socially and emotionally as well as financially can enjoy a rich life in retirement. spouses who've addressed their desired balance of sharing and independence, who are clear on their priorities individually and together, often find the best years of marriage ahead of them. advisers who work with clients to think of this broader definition of richness, beyond the money, will find that the years before and during retirement are when clients need them most.
the sussexes have already cut their teeth in broadcast media. in 2017, harry interviewed barack obama when he was the guest editor of bbc radio 4's today program and, last year, itv in the u.k. broadcast harry & meghan: an african journey, which aired in the u.s. on abc dis, -1.28% another route: the obamas reportedly inked a book deal for more than $65 million.
in a widely circulated article, ellie hall, a buzzfeed reporter, compared kate's morning sickness cure? prince william gifted with an avocado for pregnant duchess with meghan markle's beloved avocado linked to human rights abuse and drought, millennial shame, in the express. the contrasting headlines appeared in the same papers and, sometimes, with the same bylines.
but of course, it isn't all about feelings — money plays a role as well, experts agree. it may not be in all couples' budgets to take off work and travel to see relatives, which means they may choose to host their own celebration or visit with family closer to home.
people don't realize that if mom has a stroke and the hospital transfers her to a nursing home, if you don't have access to her bank account, you can't sign the checks for her unless she signed over power of attorney.

3. upstart private companies are developing technology to help comic book artists pave the way and make some money in the process. for example, madefire — which presented at new york comic con last year — offers a basic vr platform for comic book artists to develop ideas, in a format called motion books. madefire ceo and co-founder ben wolstenholme likens the final product to walking through a popup book.

the success of any plan depends on how well it's executed, so it helps to create specific objectives and consider how well you're meeting these objectives. instead of a portfolio performance review, think about this as creating an index for personal retirement life readiness.
you worked hard for this house. you raised four children as a single mother. you have every right to exhale and reflect on a life well lived, and a job well done. you succeeded where many others may have fallen apart. it's also great that you have a hard-working man in your life, and i hope he finds work in his chosen industry, or another. sit back and take a moment to enjoy all that you have accomplished. your job is done.

the document, or its details, was shortly afterwards leaked to the sun, bradby added. he said the sussexes had long faced unpleasantness from the family, saying some members were jealous and, at times, unfriendly, although excluded queen elizabeth and her husband, the duke of edinburgh from that assessment. the fallout began at the time of the wedding in 2018.

harry also has had a military career on the front lines. prince harry served in the army for ten years, rising to the rank of captain and undertaking two tours of afghanistan, according to buckingham palace. he continues to work in support of his fellow servicemen, promoting support for wounded men and women as they adapt to life post-injury.
in a column for the hollywood reporter, abdul-jabbar says the u.s. is getting sucked back to a time when pretty much everyone who wasn't a straight, white christian male was considered a second-class citizen whose rights and future depended on the patriarchs' whims and largesse.
harry receives an income from his father prince charles. harry, who is already worth several million dollars, owes his fortune to three famous women: his mother, the late princess diana, who became a global superstar; his grandmother, queen elizabeth ii, who steered the royals into the 20th and 21s centuries, and his wife, meghan markle, an american-born self-made former actress.
but indie comic book creators also can go the native code route, pruett says. a thriving indie developer community of smallish teams of a half a dozen people or less produce some of the most successful vr games, without financial backing from big studios. the popular beat saber and superhot vr games are examples. small indie teams are the authors of some of the best content we have today, pruett says.
2. the big entertainment companies that own the most successful comic book content don't want to give up control of characters and story lines, says jaron lanier, author of dawn of the new everything: encounters with reality and virtual reality.

budweiser is one of the many ab inbev brands. the company's board of directors is comprised of 15 members, its website explains. two of the members are women. listings of other leaders across the company show many — though not exclusively — male faces.
and now that i have said that, i feel compelled to tell you what is not your responsibility. you met a man nine years younger than you are, and you clearly love each other and he has fallen on some difficult times. i understand that he has helped you with the renovations, but it's not your job to acquiesce to his demands or the needs of your adult children regarding what happens to your estate.
that's a possibility. you could say: 'i recently updated my legal documents. maybe you want to meet with my attorney?'
money is a way we measure value in society. i think it's important as we age to get paid for our work. often, there's a big push telling older people to just step to the side and volunteer. we should be paid for the value we bring to the table, said vanderburg.
that's in line with reality. the pew research center found that 40% of households with children under age 18 counted mothers as the sole or main source of income, up from 11% in 1960.
but let's be very clear: three days' notice of a prenuptial agreement before your wedding without any willingness to compromise on the details or discuss them is sorely lacking in consideration, and is a chaotic and unsettling start to a marriage. i understand why it left you reeling, and why you felt both confused and angry. in a marital property state, in the absence of a prenup, assets are distributed in a fair and equitable manner. inheritance is not considered marital property, so you should have no worries on that front.
the seemingly offbeat relationship between the former president and the rock star began when springsteen performed at benefits for obama during his presidential campaigns. but it has blossomed into deeper conversations since he left office, obama said in the first episode.
that's exactly what i heard when i spoke with a variety of people in their late 60s and early 70s about what led them to become self-employed at this time of life. (of course, many others work after 65+ because they need the money.) as much as those i talked to said they're glad about the self-employment income, the psychic rewards are even greater.

americans aren't the only people pessimistic about future generations' finances. canadians aren't very hopeful, nor are those in france, greece, japan, australia, kenya and mexico. overall, a median of 41% of residents in countries pew surveyed believe children in their country will be better off. the gloomy outlooks comes even as people view their country's economy positively — 58% of americans, for example, said the economic standing of the u.s. was good in a separate pew survey earlier this year. pew interviewed about 40,000 residents in 38 countries.
we want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day, he added. the idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public-health measures, and others are not.

this might seem like obvious advice, but it can be hard to remember in the midst of calls and texts from relatives seeking to learn your holiday plans: partners need to make sure they don't commit to either family before discussing the choice with each other, said naylor.
if this friendship doesn't recover, that's ok. what was your part? were you quietly competing with them too? either way, i believe that we journey through people, and just because a friendship ends does not mean it was not a success for the time that it lasted. sometimes, they simply run their course. finally, every challenging experience we have and every person we meet is here to teach us something. and so what has this decades-long friendship taught you?
on saturday, buckingham palace announced a deal had been reached for harry and meghan markle to relinquish their official duties as members of the british royal family. they have agreed not to use his/her royal highness, and will repay the state the costs of renovating their u.k. base, frogmore cottage. but they're now free to pursue their own business opportunities overseas.
another new company hopes to find a place amid investors' ever-changing values. motif, an online brokerage platform for investing in specific themes, such as biotech and health, introduced motif impact portfolios in march, where people invest in their beliefs and customize the list of funds put in those thematic buckets. investors may be particularly passionate about a subject, such as climate change or corporate governance, but if there are funds for companies investors don't believe are aligned, they can change those allocations. we are constantly voting with our consumer dollars, but not with our investing dollars, said hardeep walia, chief executive officer of motif.
mental health issues put additional strain on marriage, with 20% of iraq and afghanistan veterans reporting experiences with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, experts say. another study from military.com — a website that gives people with a connection to the military access to jobs, benefits and discounts — found that even non-deployed military members found their relationships struggled due to marrying too young and moving too often.

we weren't blind to these downsides, but life decisions can't always be based on what looks best on paper. starting a family in our mid-20s was aligned with our long-term goals, like traveling later in life and enjoying more years with our kids. if that required finding a way to budget and saving for the future on a tighter budget, we were up for it.

good grief. as if the covid-19 crisis has not already done enough damage, all the extra stress and forced togetherness may be causing some married couples to call it quits. if you're going down that road, anecdotal evidence suggests you'll have plenty of company. sad, but apparently true.
martha lane fox, co-founder of lastminute.com, who now runs responsible tech think-tank doteveryone, is renowned for being one of the business community's cheeriest entrepreneurs. but baroness lane-fox of soho is despairing at the chance of the gender pay gap ever being eliminated in her lifetime in her industry. asked by the media masters podcast about tech's notorious gender imbalance, lane fox — who sits as a crossbencher in the house of lords — said: when you look at the numbers, they're unbelievably disappointing and dispiriting. there are more women, as a percentage, in the house of lords than there are in technology; a 1,000-year-old institution versus something that didn't even exist 30, 40 years ago. so, i'm not sure we're ever actually going to get to a level playing field, because if you look at the trajectory now we're actually going backward, and yet this is a sector that is growing bigger and bigger and bigger.
harry's late mother, princess diana — who died at 36 in a car crash in paris in 1997 while being pursued by photographers — had long battled the relentless, prying eyes of the british red tops, which dissected her every move in the years following her 1981 marriage to prince charles, and 1996 divorce. she had reportedly long dreamed of starting a new life in the u.s.
neither your husband or stepson are unlikely to change. but you can take actions to ensure that you wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night feeling safe in your own home. what happens to your home after you're gone is an important consideration for you. however, given what you have revealed in your letter, it should be way down on your list of priorities. i believe you can do it — and, with the right amount of outside support, i feel confident that you will begin to believe that too.

one of the biggest mistakes people tend to make in their 50s or 60s is they tend to be condescending when talking to their parents. if you approach the conversation from the point of view that 'i know more about these things and i see you making mistakes and i'm going to point them out,' that just embarrasses a parent and puts them on the defensive and they shut down.

and what do you do when your parent simply won't discuss any of this and won't give you power of attorney?
if the parents don't have a will or an advance health care directive and haven't given their child power of attorney, then if they are no longer mentally competent — maybe due to dementia or a stroke or a car accident — the child can't step in and make financial and health decisions. the child would then have to go through a lengthy and expensive court process to be named a conservator or guardian of the parents.
multiple newspapers, including the daily telegraph in the u.k., have reported that the queen was disappointed with the surprise announcement, and had asked the sussexes to hold off on issuing a statement. when the sun newspaper published a front-page story that the couple was contemplating a move to canada, the sussexes pushed the button on their statement.

the answer was clear. continuing to grow my business would yield more money over time and allow us to save more—and it made me happy. this was a lightbulb moment that prompted us to get creative about finding affordable child care that was compatible with my career. we ended up organizing an in-home nanny share with another family, which gave the kids a playmate and us moms reliable work hours.

more importantly, overruling would also likely be seen as breaking the filibuster without voting to get rid of the filibuster. if a provision can be brought into reconciliation bill, ruled out of order by the parliamentarian and then be allowed on a simple majority vote, that is no different than passing the same thing outside of reconciliation with 51 votes, the argument goes. the counterargument is overrides could still be stopped with a supermajority, making it different from scrapping the filibuster.

saxo bank strategist eleanor creagh said, given biden's lead in the polls, a strong showing in the debate could raise expectations of a democratic clean sweep. one way to lower the odds of a contested outcome (that brings noise and volatility) is via a large margin of victory that cannot be undermined, she said.

as these partnerships between employers and colleges grow, they won't replace traditional higher education, but they may play an important part in the sector's future. already, our nation's colleges are shifting from places dominated by 18 to 24-year-olds who recently left home to adult, working students — exactly the group may of these programs target.

trump's insistence that climate change is a hoax has put the world economy and the viability of the planet in further danger. he says that the wildfires ravaging the american west are the result of poor forest management. he has depreciated american soldiers' heroism and sacrifice, and has no appreciation or understanding that the economy needs people's heroism to dream up new ideas and risk investing in their development and market entry.

that's a tactic where the party in power would add extra seats to the nine-person supreme court and fill those new seats with their own appointees.
his populist rhetoric has not translated into better pay for less advantaged workers or victims of discrimination. he has sought to erase any sense of economic justice. he cares nothing about the appallingly low wage rates for those at the bottom or about the terrible living standards that these wages afford. and he has done nothing to support the eradication of statistical discrimination—racial, gender, and lgbt+.
the tuition coverage also fell in line with starbucks' history of offering generous health insurance and other benefits to its baristas — a move that helped them attract and retain talent. but by 2014, when the company announced the program, obamacare had made access to health insurance more of a norm for a wider swath of workers. the asu program helped to keep starbucks at the top of the heap when it came to benefits packages, the company's then-ceo howard schultz told the atlantic in 2015.

hauser also said the trump administration seems to be signalling that lobbying is nothing to be ashamed of as many former lobbyists have executive-branch jobs, and at the same time more people might be disclosing their lobbying activities now that former trump campaign chairman paul manafort is in prison after failing to register as a foreign agent.

today, a great many people support biden on these grounds and others. trump stands in the way of the nation regaining a sense of flourishing, equity, and social harmony.
for example, biden wants to roll back trump's 20% long-term capital-gains tax on investments and restore the 39.6% top tax rate for anyone making over $1 million. he'd also close loopholes that wealthy americans avoid taxes on capital gains altogether and raise estate taxes back to the historical norm, according to the draft platform.
the confirmation hearing is scheduled to roll on over the objections of democrats like harris. she reiterated those concerns at the debate, saying lawmakers should let the next president pick the next judge after the election.
the platform also mentions providing more equitable access to employer-sponsored retirement plans through automatic enrollment.
the only historical episode that shows any resemblance is kennedy's fight with the steel industry 56 years ago. worried about inflation, the white house brokered a deal in which union workers accepted a smaller raise than they wanted and the steelmakers tacitly agreed not to raise steel prices.
the african-american vote was key in south carolina, and biden scored a critical endorsement on wednesday from rep. jim clyburn, the highest-ranking black member of congress. buttigieg, klobuchar and warren have performed poorly in polls of black voters — who make up about 60% of south carolina's democratic electorate.
but harris didn't buy it. if you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you, she said during the debate.
just don't expect such great deals on bacon, whose cost soared in 2014 after disease wiped out millions of piglets. americans much prefer bacon to any other cut of pork, so prices only fell slightly last year even though the pig herd increased.
companies and groups last year increased their spending on washington lobbying to a level not seen in nearly a decade, according to the latest disclosures.
trump has not let up. he's issued 13 tweets critical of amazon since the middle of 2017, including a barrage in the past five days targeting the company's shipping deal with the u.s. post office. he's claimed the post office loses money even though independent analysis shows the usps makes a profit on the deal.
new home buyers did get small breaks in other ways. furniture prices slid 2.3% in 2015 and the cost of clocks, lamps, cookware and tableware posted even steeper declines.
protestors target fed policies at meeting in wyoming
an optional process congress can choose to use after adopting a budget resolution that allows some types of legislation to be filibuster-proof in the senate and thus easier to pass.
the affordable care act is going to cost more and enroll less people through its exchanges than previously thought, according to a new congressional budget office report.
former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg, massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar trailed far behind the top three. former new york mayor mike bloomberg skipped the first four 2020 nominating contests, and is focusing on the 14 states that will vote on super tuesday, march 3.
infrastructure: probably. while biden has indicated infrastructure will not be a part of his initial package aimed at easing the economic pain caused by the pandemic, it may be in a second round of reconciliation this year. a surge of spending on infrastructure – but limited to five or ten years like the bush tax cuts to avoid the byrd outyear deficit prohibition – could pass parliamentary muster, if written correctly, experts say. it's not a slam dunk, though — the nature of highway trust fund spending, which is not quite appropriations and not exactly direct spending, could be a problem.
but even with these kinds of supports, bergeron suggests potential students weigh whether their degree would provide them with a bigger economic boost if they earned it another way.
who is this parliamentarian and why do they matter?
if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat, a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, then join us, biden said.
opinion: biden can forge bipartisan cooperation with a bold infrastructure program
the estimated 40 million-plus unpaid family caregivers would also get a financial boost. among the ideas biden backs is an annual tax credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers to reimburse expenses. unpaid family caregivers would also be able to accrue social security benefits for the time they spend caregiving. and they'd be allowed to make catch-up contributions to retirement accounts, even if they're not earning an income.
some experts think even that's a little high. the kaiser family foundation's analysis suggests that enrollment would be, at most, 15 or 16 million, and that's only if all state enrollment rates matched those of the top 10 states now.
over the past year or so, thousands of people have become eligible to attend college at low or no-cost — and that's not thanks to a new government policy or a sudden drop in tuition levels.
vice president mike pence and sen. kamala harris engaged in a more civil, substantive debate than president donald trump and democratic nominee joe biden did one week earlier.
ann romney, whose in this together came out in paperback tuesday, talked on msnbc about the book; her struggles with illness and depression and the return of hope; her new center at brigham and women's hospital in boston; and, of course, her noteworthy family.
social security: early in the first obama administration, numerous democrats flirted with the idea of serious deficit reduction including cuts in social security benefits, possibly by raising the retirement age. those days are gone with the biden platform.
workers tend to stick around when their company pays for their education
biden made a direct appeal to super tuesday voters in remarks in columbia, s.c., and jabbed at sanders by saying people don't want a revolution.
edmund phelps, the 2006 nobel laureate in economics and director of the center on capitalism and society at columbia university, is the author of mass flourishing and co-author of dynamism.
if enrollment is shrinking, why are costs increasing? as always, you can blame the economy.
the cost of college and student debt is top of mind for a wide swath of americans and policymakers. that means, in terms of pr, being able to do something about this would be a terrific thing, cappelli said.
that's not to say the pair answered all the questions posed to them.
some blame deleveraging. some blame obamacare. some say federal budget deficits have been too big, and others that they've been too small. still others blame excessive corporate greed, and others excessive corporate taxes.
sometimes, it isn't until after the interview that an employee gets a real sense of the company's culture. take into consideration how you fit in and what you're doing to get there. this could take a negative turn for your new job, unfortunately, but that's okay, salemi said. people can become numb to unpleasant situations, such as a rude coworker, which can create workplace conflicts. it's better to be honest about these situations, and take note of what you like and don't like about the place for when you're looking for your next job. if after a few months you don't plan to stick it out, be honest with future interviewers about your values, what you want out of a job and what you can give. you want to be vigilant in the first 100 days, and self-aware, salemi said.
the global coronavirus death toll has now passed 1 million, according to johns hopkins university, which united nations secretary-general antónio guterres described as an agonizing milestone. many regions around the world are still reporting rising numbers of infections, also fueling fears over the impact of a second wave.
so what does merely incidental mean?
which brings us back to the markets and the economy, of course. obamacare, bank bailouts, reckless spending, infrastructure investment and anything else the u.s. government wants to do is a lot easier to do and has a temporarily positive effect on the economy so long as the government can borrow money at close to 0%. and whatever clinton or trump spend our future generation's money on by borrowing trillions will probably seem to work well at least while rates are this low.
she also said in 2016 that she doesn't think the right to abortion is likely to change, but some of the restrictions would change.
there are a lot cheaper ways to get headlines, she said. as of september, more than 13,500 associates had been accepted into the program, which now offers more than 50 choices for career and educational advancement. we will continue to expand until we truly feel like everybody has an option, she said.
his weakening of the affordable care act (obamacare) has heavily affected people with low incomes.
consumer prices rose just 0.7% last year to mark the second slowest rise in inflation in 54 years, the government said wednesday. (the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in 2008 during the worst of the great recession.)
starbucks is committed to helping at least 25,000 employees graduate by 2025, novoa said, which the company estimates will cost at least $250 million.
the confirmation hearing for trump's supreme court nominee, judge amy coney barrett, is scheduled to start oct. 12. barrett would replace justice ruth bader ginsburg, a member of the court's liberal wing, who died at age 87 last month.
the cbo is now expecting enrollment to max out at 19 million in 2019.
in addition, given the high cost of college, many americans may never gain access to higher education without some kind of employer help.
the peak lobbying spending in 2009 and 2010 was driven in large part by efforts to influence obamacare and the dodd-frank financial reform law, as well as cap-and-trade legislation and the employee free choice act, the revolving door project's hauser said.
harris's home state of california is leading the charge to defend the law and they say 20 million people could lose health coverage if the aca falls.
and he calls for expanding the unemployment insurance system to cover independent contractors and gig workers, many of whom are over 50.

if you dressed up for the restaurant, however, take heart. the cost of buying a men's suit dropped 4% and women's dresses fell almost 10%.
moving to your new home was also expensive. freight costs leaped 13%.
i personally expect clinton to win and that she'll basically keep the bush/obama/republican-democrat regime status quo intact with all the corruption, corporatism and wall street-controlled government that comes with it. that doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing for the stock market and the economy either. and then the republicans will claim they're worried about socialism, and the show will go on. if trump wins, i'd expect we'll see much of the same status quo mentioned above.
today, that competitive pressure is more urgent than ever.
although the trump administration has tried to repeal the aca — obama's signature legislation —and made it less comprehensive, biden would expand the aca with the goal of lowering americans' health care costs. if costs fell, that would be a boon to those in the second half of life and not yet eligible for medicare.
investors are anxiously awaiting the first presidential debate between president donald trump and democratic challenger joe biden, which is expected to attract a record-breaking television audience from 9 p.m. eastern time on tuesday night.
by 2020, 50% of workforce will be remote. here's how.
finally, americans are living with the virtual stagnation of the economy since the early 1970s (interrupted for about a decade by the information revolution). this continuing malaise lies behind wage earners' increased frustration over their relative standing in wage distribution—a sentiment that, more than anything else, accounted for trump's rise. there can be no question that a president biden—unlike president trump—would want to restore the economy to its former glory.
south carolina offers 54 delegates of the 1,991 needed to win the democratic nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention in july. ahead of saturday's primary, sanders led in the delegate tally, followed by buttigieg, biden, warren and klobuchar, according to a tracker by nbc news.
projections have a tendency to change, especially with this sprawling a piece of legislation, said cynthia cox, an associate director at kaiser, but she noted that the new numbers were framed in terms of economic outlook and wage growth even as enrollment projections have declined.
although undoubtedly under the clean-sweep scenario there is the negative implications for risk assets to be considered, stemming from a democratic legislative agenda including higher corporate taxes and increased capital-gains taxes, creagh added.
cheap gas helped fuel a car-buying binge in 2015 as americans bought new vehicles at a record rate. low interest rates and dealer incentives added a helping hand: prices of new autos were basically flat last year.
that comes weeks after the president signed an executive order pledging protections so americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.
infrastructure is building around these programs, indicating they're likely to become even more widespread.
for walmart, part of the appeal of partnering with guild is that the organization has screened the university partners to make sure they have a track-record of success with adult and working students, malashock said. in addition, guild offers individual coaching and other resources as part of its programming.
harris didn't answer pence's question. harris and biden say they want to build on obamacare by adding a public health insurance option and lowering the medicaid eligibility age to 60 from 65.
and here's where it gets weird. while many focus on the size of a budget impact — would a $50 million change in revenues over 10 years be merely incidental in a $2 trillion reconciliation bill? — experts warn that the test is not just about the size of fiscal change but also its relation to the policy involved.
phrma and bristol-myers declined to comment, while abbvie, j&j, merck and pfizer didn't respond to requests for comment.
biden is also attentive to the existential threat of continuing climate change. there is a vast litany of problems, such as the burning of fossil fuels causing increased levels of carbon dioxide and rising temperatures. addressing these problems will require government intervention and international cooperation, such as that mandated by the 2015 paris climate agreement, from which trump withdrew the u.s.
health care: the health care proposals are really trying to take obamacare to the next level, says ornstein. it's probably the next thing obama would have done if he could have a third term. the affordable care act [aca] was always a step toward robust universal coverage.
tuition reimbursement programs have been essentially ubiquitous at major employers for years. but those programs, which provide workers with money for tuition after they've already paid it, have relatively low participation rates and are typically geared towards white collar workers looking to improve their skill set, including through earning a graduate degree.
no one can doubt that, if elected, biden would be eager to play a central role in the resumption of the battle against global warming.
this proposal recognizes, if you're going to be serious about home-based and community services, it will take real dollars, says ruth katz, senior vice president for public policy/advocacy at leadingage, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.
between a coronavirus pandemic that had infected 7.6 million americans as of friday and a high-stakes supreme court case just weeks away, health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions is on the minds of many.
and there are several ideas to lower prescription drug costs that democrats have pushed for years — including some trump has supported. medicare would be free to negotiate prices with drug companies; makers of medicare-covered prescriptions wouldn't be allowed to raise prices by more than inflation and consumers could legally buy prescription drugs from other countries.
white house conflicts with business are not uncommon. presidents have often been critical of big businesses or how they operate. more recently drugmakers have come under fire for raising prices, for example, and other firms have been assailed for moving their headquarters outside the u.s. in a process known as a corporate inversion.
data-mining software company palantir technologies , and workplace collaboration and planning software provider asana are expected to go public on wednesday via the first direct listings of 2020, according to reports.
they'll use a process called budget reconciliation, not to be confused with talk of unity and political reconciliation. it has been used often for high-profile legislation, including massive tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017 and 2010's affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
they are among the hardest working people, yet the lowest paid workers, says eric kingston, professor of social work at syracuse university. the emphasis on caregiving is long overdue.
the biggest relief, of course, came at the gas station.

first, biden understands that in america there is still a crushing disparity between the wages of the seriously less-advantaged and those paid to middle-income people—and payments for single mothers do not change that.
obama did not criticize staples again publicly.
so let's look at obama's track record to find evidence of anti-colonial mindset, itself a phrase devoid of much meaning but for argument's sake will translate as anti-western populism.
the same could not be said for insuring vehicles. forget all those funny tv ads about cut-rate plans: auto insurance jumped 5.7% last year.
to hear the current mayor of london, and possibly future prime minister of britain tell it, president barack obama harbors a dislike of the u.k. because of an anti-colonial mindset developed by having a kenyan father.
going all the way back to the early 1900s, presidents have shied away from singling out specific companies. they usually stick to more general, if infrequent, industry criticism and use milder language unlikely to roil stock markets.
for example, walmart recently added purdue global, an all online arm of purdue university that was created when the school acquired kaplan university, a for-profit college, to its list of schools where employees could earn their degrees.
biden's appeal to moderates includes his pledge to build on the affordable care act, or obamacare, named after the president he served under for eight years. long popular with african-american voters, the former vice president has also proposed creating national standards for home appraisals, as part of an effort to stamp out racial discrimination in the real-estate industry.
it remains to be seen whether eight justices will hear the case or nine justices will decide the matter.
shares in abbvie are down 13% this year, astrazeneca is off by 1% and bristol-myers has lost 11%.
what's unprecedented about trump's criticism of amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% , however, is the frequency and intensity of his attacks and an apparent personal animus toward company owner jeff bezos.
these are programs that are designed to be revenue generators, whether we call it profit or excess revenue it's basically the same thing, said kinser, the penn state professor.
another large household expense, medical care, also accelerated. the cost of going to the doctor's office or the hospital rose 2.9% in 2015 to mark the fastest increase in three years, the cpi report showed.

the authors of the study, john graham and campbell harvey, finance professors at duke's fuqua school of business, also considered and rejected a number of hypotheses to explain the gap between the cost of capital and the return cfos want. for example, it isn't that small companies involve higher risks; large companies actually set a higher hurdle rate than smaller ones.
blanchflower said underemployment is not caused by obamacare because it is so prevalent around the globe.
some employees certainly do benefit from the programs. but the limits on where the perk can be used, what workers can study and how challenging it can be for employees to make it through school while working at the same time mean that the companies have probably run the numbers and know that offering the benefit is not going to be super costly, cappelli said.
this story was published on june 15, 2019 and updated on september 24, 2019.
but that cost could take some time to change the behavior of consumers, since they'll only pay the penalty the following year, alongside their taxes, she said.
but that's not the prime motivation of obama. brexit has emerged as the number-one economic concern for the globe. that was clear from the spring meeting of the international monetary fund, and it's been made by policy makers from tokyo to berlin.
to put a stop to that, byrd proposed a senate rule that was later codified into law. the rule has six thou shalt not provisions about what cannot be included in reconciliation bills. the most prominent are prohibitions against changes to social security, increasing the budget deficit in the so-called out years, years beyond those mentioned in the instructions to the committees, and any changes that have only a merely incidental effect on revenues or spending.
part of the motivation for launching walmart's education benefits program was to help employees continue to build their skills so they're prepared for a long career at the company, malashock said. the company chose to add 14 degree offerings focused on technology to the program last month in part because like many retailers, walmart is becoming more and more of a technology company, malashock said.
these programs are likely poised to grow
for a tool that's been mostly used for partisan purposes for the last 20 years, its name does sound odd. it stems from the technical purpose in the law creating it, that the bills that receive protection from the filibuster are meant to reconcile current law and pending bills in congress to the fiscal targets in the budget resolution.
reading through the draft democratic platform, the cumulative effect is that the federal government would take on a bigger role in everything from retirement security to health care to sustainability. a core idea: animating the greater government activism with policies to improve the general welfare and social connectedness.
it's a focus on the common good and sharing risk and strengthening the safety net, including the retirement safety net, says norm ornstein, political scientist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute.
a prolonged slog for the nomination would raise the possibility of a contested convention, in which no candidate will win the magic number of delegates on the first ballot at this summer's convention in milwaukee. the last time the democrats' convention went past the first ballot was 1952.
older americans who buy long-term care insurance and pay for it from their retirement savings would get a generous tax break, too.
caregiving, caregivers and long-term care: the most striking part of biden's platform — to me — is its emphasis on supporting the professional long-term care workforce serving older adults in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and in homes, as well as assisting family caregivers.
so far this year, pharma's lobbying spending is staying sizeable. phrma spent $9.91 million to influence washington in the first quarter, according to a disclosure filed in late april. and the q1 total is $10.01 million when the trade group's subsidiaries are included, says a tally from opensecrets.org.
also on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home. rents climbed 3.7%, the biggest increase in eight years.
in 2015, obama criticized the office superstore staples for supposedly cutting pay for workers and keeping their hours down to avoid health-care costs associated with the law commonly known as obamacare. staples countered by saying the president appears not to have all the facts.
last night as i was closing my computer before taking care of my medically fragile (but less so than ever) daughter, amaris, i saw a picture of donald trump and hillary clinton on a headline on scutify. my happiness about playing with and feeding my daughter was momentarily suspended, as i felt myself stress out about this election once again. long-time readers know that i'm committed to my stance against ever voting for anyone in the republican-democrat regime, but this post isn't about politics. and the point of this intro is that i think it's finally be time to hedge our portfolios for some election-stress discounts coming into the markets.
i think aca supporters should be concerned, bagley told nbc news. not panicked: the lawsuit is weak and the supreme court is unlikely to endorse it. but a small risk of a bad thing is worth worrying about.
either way, the process is opaque, even for the often-byzantine senate. no written decision is formally issued and sometimes even the staff can be unsure why the parliamentarian ruled the way they did or how much weight as a precedent a call has.
on roe vs. wade, the landmark 1973 ruling on abortion, barrett said in 2013 that the public response to controversial cases like roe reflects public rejection of the proposition that [precedent] can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remain forever unchanging. court watchers embrace the possibility of overruling, even if they may want it to be the exception rather than the rule.
sanders held a rally saturday in warren's home state of massachusetts, and projected confidence as that state's voters prepared to go to polls tuesday. if we have the largest voter turnout in the history of the massachusetts primary, we can win here in massachusetts, we can win the democratic nomination, we can defeat donald trump and we can transform this country, sanders said in boston, according to the boston herald.
after launching the asu-starbucks partnership in 2014, edplus, an institution within asu that designs online courses and degree programs for the school, was able to use that as a model to work with other companies to offer similar programs, said sean hobson, chief design officer at edplus.
in other words, cfos are setting a 14% hurdle rate for new investment even the cost of borrowing money in the bond market, and the imputed cost of borrowing money from investors through the equity market, was around 6% or 7%.
the trump administration is waging a legal fight against the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, arguing that it must be scrapped a decade after its overhaul of u.s. health care xlv, -0.06% . the supreme court is slated to hear arguments on the matter on nov. 10.
it's possible a coronavirus infection would become a pre-existing condition without the aca, according to levitt. he also noted that trump's executive order on pre-existing conditions carries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the aca or protect people with pre-existing conditions.
the lowest-income americans would be automatically enrolled in the public option without health care premiums; they could opt out at any time.
trump listed the tasks he plans to accomplish in his first 100 days of president before he was elected, during a speech in gettysburg, pa. in it, he said he intended to impose term limits on congress, introduce 10 pieces of legislation that would repeal obamacare, fund the construction of the southern border wall, and rebuild military bases, among other priorities. thus far, he has pushed to repeal obamacare — but support came up short and therefore the affordable care act is still in place — and asked congress for a little more than $4 billion to begin building the wall. as of april 18, trump's approval rating was 42% — down from 45% when he was inaugurated, according to gallup.
the tax cuts and jobs act and subsequent efforts to get extenders and clarifications passed have been big drivers in the rise in lobbying spending since 2016, said jeff hauser, founder and director of the revolving door project, which aims to track corporate political influence and is part of the center for economic and policy research, a left-leaning think tank. there also has been considerable lobbying around drug pricing, tariffs and other trade issues, immigration and big tech fdn, -0.36% matters.
the draft platform backs a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for the caregiving workforce. in addition, they'd get up to 12 weeks of federally provided paid family and medical leave.
pence didn't answer the question, though, at another point in the evening, he said the trump administration has plans to improve health care and protect pre-existing conditions for every american.

joe biden's running mate also criticized trump and the republican-led senate's decision to ignore the late liberal supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg's final wish to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen — and asked voters to make them pay on nov. 3.

she and her husband, the 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney, have some two dozen grandchildren, in addition to their five sons. she said that her book includes confessions to a few really, really bad parenting moments but that she and her husband live for their kids' kids:
the disclosed outlays by these enterprises to influence washington climbed to a total of about $70 million in 2018, the second-highest level ever behind their spending of $87 million in 2009, when obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector. that's shown in the adjacent chart and based on data from opensecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that's run by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics.
we'll have to continue to freshly analyze the economy, cycles and markets regardless.
the paper argues that the labor department doesn't do a good job in measuring underemployment. its current measure of part time for economic reasons does not ask how many hours the underemployed want to work.
the attacks on amazon, along with a spate of new white house tariffs, have clearly unnerved investors. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% sank on monday after trump hinted that the post office contract could be reworked in a way that would be more costly for amazon, and after a recovery on tuesday, fell once more on wednesday.
in total for the first quarter, the trade group and the seven companies spent about $25 million, suggesting they could set a new record this year.
at issue is full employment, the level where the unemployment rate can't go lower without resulting in higher inflation.
the white house didn't stop there. the justice department, led by robert kennedy, probed the price increases and reportedly sent fbi agents to interview steel executives at their homes. the defense department also shifted some submarine contracts to smaller steelmakers that declined to raise prices.
the draft platform says democrats will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, but doesn't offer a dollar amount for the cap. it also talks about ensuring that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost, but doesn't explain how that would happen.
the idea for the program came from talking to the company's employees and learning that many had a desire to finish college, but couldn't afford it, said noelle novoa, a senior manager for social impact communications at the company. starbucks officials realized they could help, she said.
there are 54 million non-elderly adults with a pre-existing condition that would have resulted in coverage denial without the aca, according to the kaiser family foundation.

but the first 100 days can give new employees a false sense of security, too. once you get the hang of it and are in a routine, you don't take the time to take stock and pause, said vicki salemi, a career expert for jobs site monster.com. it's important to do that while things are still fresh.
improve social security's long-term solvency (its trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2035 or perhaps sooner due to the pandemic) by having americans with high wages pay the same social security payroll taxes that middle-class families pay. the platform didn't offer specifics, but biden has said he'd require people to pay social security taxes on income over roughly $400,000. today, employment earnings of up to $137,700 are subject to social security payroll taxes.

big pharma is clearly feeling the heat, said the campaign for sustainable rx pricing in a statement on phrma's first-quarter lobbying. that campaign, which regularly criticizes drugmakers, is backed by health insurers, hospital operators, physician groups, the aarp and pharmacy benefit managers, a sector that also has drawn flak on capitol hill for its role in pricing.

the biggest change here would convert tax-deductible contributions to 401(k)s, which favor higher-income families, into tax credits equalizing the tax break for all income levels. ghilarducci thinks this would lead to most people eligible for 401(k) plans putting at least some money into them.
but here's a culprit everybody missed: america's chief financial officers.
but the markets — tech and my revolution investing stocks including amazon amzn, -1.71% , facebook fb, -0.13% and google googl, -1.31% specifically — have been on one heck of tear from the brexit lows, when we had the opportunity to sneak in and buy some more of our favorite stocks at a temporary discount.

when there's a question of whether a provision would be successfully challenged on the floor via the byrd rule, the issue is usually argued first in the parliamentarian's office by staff from the two parties. the parliamentarian may rule then or withhold a ruling until the issue is brought up on the floor.
immigration reform: sort of. some parts of a plan similar to what was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would squarely be within the bounds of reconciliation, experts say. but some other portions, particularly those without any revenue or spending effects, would not be, leaving the possibility of a swiss cheese immigration bill with loopholes.
new york (project syndicate)—commentators have offered many reasons why one should vote in november for joe biden, the democratic nominee for u.s. president. yet the economic dimension of the election has been of little interest to pundits, and few, if any, economists speaking on the subject have bothered to highlight how the outcome bears directly on people's welfare.
the steel industry backed down, but the standoff frightened wall street much like trump's attacks on amazon today. the dow began to slide in 1961, but it sank another 20% after the steel standoff.

one reply from pence in particular could leave millions of americans with pre-existing health conditions wishing for more.
companies are starting to have a better understanding of this trend and the skills required from their workers to meet their business needs — and they're willing to pay for workers to meet those needs, said jaime fall, the director of upskill america at the aspen institute, an employer initiative promoting training and advancement opportunities for workers.
a recording that surfaced last week sheds light on some current approaches to washington lobbying, even as it mostly got attention for its implications in trump's ongoing impeachment trial. the tape — which was released by a lawyer for lev parnas, an indicted associate of rudy giuliani — features donors to a trump super pac making requests such as backing for a 500-mile highway that would be used just by self-driving trucks, a new york times report said. another donor pushed the president to further limit steel imports.
climate change: while a concern for americans of all ages, a next avenue reader survey of our 50+ readers taken before the pandemic found climate change was the no. 1 election issue for them.
the spinoff bills — a tax bill, a spending bill (or a combined deficit-increasing or deficit-reducing bill that includes both tax and spending changes) and debt-ceiling bill — are immune to the filibuster in the senate, meaning they can be passed with 50 votes and the vice president's vote as the tiebreaker. but if parts of the bills stray from budget-related issues, they can get stripped out individually and require a supermajority, usually 60 votes, to retain.
trump's disregard for this fiscal profligacy has set a precedent for unnecessary deficits in future administrations. (of course, the deficit incurred more recently in responding to the pandemic was unavoidable and, under the circumstances, beneficial.)
even though the unemployment rate is at historic lows in many countries this still does not suggest that these country's labor markets are anywhere close to full employment, the paper said.
you all have the knowledge and expertise to solve these problems. we lack that knowledge and expertise, but if you don't solve it, we will, said burgess, the ranking member of the house energy & commerce committee's health subcommittee. he added that the companies probably won't like lawmakers' solutions. the hearing was titled lowering prescription drug prices: deconstructing the drug supply chain.
for all these reasons, it is vitally important that the people vote for the biden-harris ticket. trump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the american dream.
michelle malashock, a walmart spokeswoman, said the company isn't yet comfortable sharing the amount of money it's spending on the program, but she described it as a significant investment.
even better, the cost of buying groceries to prepare meals at home actually fell for the first time in six years and only the second time since 1976.
biden's platform also embraces state medicaid home- and community-based care for low-income adults. its $450 billion initiative targets getting 800,000 people off waiting lists for community care.
first, the house and senate have to agree to a budget resolution, something that happened regularly until the late 1990s but now only happens when both chambers are held by the same party. in that resolution, lawmakers lay out tax, spending and deficit targets for the years ahead and give instructions to specific committees to write legislation to hit those targets.
european stocks also fell, as political uncertainty and fears of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic concerned investors. the pan-european stoxx 600 xx:sxxp was 0.3% lower in early trading, after enjoying its best one-day advance since june 22 on monday. asian markets were mixed overnight despite wall street's gains.
trump's misguided crusade to reduce the harmless trade deficit has shrunk world trade, thus worsening the efficiency of resource allocation at home and abroad.
companies are forming to help facilitate partnerships between businesses and colleges. one is denver-based guild education, which was founded in 2015 and works with companies like walmart to streamline the system students use to access the programs, offer support services and the process by which companies pay the tuition.

americans were also able to pig out more cheaply, as size of the u.s. pig herd hit the highest level since the government began keeping track in the late 1980s. the cost of pork fell 7%, mainly because of the cheapest ham prices in several years. shoppers can buy fresh hams for $2 a pound or less in stores now.
meanwhile, our lives, jobs, the fed, the e.u., the currency wars, energy, tech, innovation, and everything else that makes up these cycles, these economies, these societies we live in will go on.
it's become pretty trendy for these big corporations to offer higher education benefits, tuition benefits, degree programs, things along those lines to help students, said kevin kinser, a professor at penn state university and head of the school's department of education policy studies. it clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.
set up routine meetings with the boss
one expert said a republican proposal to split the ninth circuit of federal courts — a long-sought goal of conservatives who see the circuit as dominated by liberal judges — was dropped after the senate parliamentarian indicated that even though the change would have fiscal impact and include the autopilot direct spending reconciliation is used for, the budget impact would be seen as incidental to the policy change involved.

more than 100 million people also had health conditions that, without the law, would possibly result in higher premiums and coverage limits, wrote larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the foundation, which focuses public health matters.
there's just such an increase in activity from lawmakers that it's really not surprising to see an increase in lobbying activity as well, lindsay bealor greenleaf, a former registered lobbyist for drug manufacturers, told marketwatch. she is currently director of policy at consulting firm advi health, where drugmakers and physician groups are among her clients.
in some cases, the employers acknowledge these challenges. over the course of offering its program, starbucks realized that roughly one in five of its employees had an academic history that would mean they couldn't get into asu, novoa said. in response, they launched a program in 2017 called pathway to admission, which offers employees who don't meet asu's admissions standards the opportunity to take up to 10 courses for free to qualify.
over the past several years, demographic trends have caused the number of high school graduates to drop. that means colleges have fewer students to pull from and some are struggling to balance their budgets amid enrollment challenges.
in other words: future economic growth isn't expected to benefit poor people, which will accelerate the aca's overall costs.
in addition to being a great recruitment tool, cappelli's research found that tuition assistance can also help retain employees. workers stick around while they use the benefit in order to finish their degree, which often takes many years because slugging through college part-time while working can be a slow process, the research found.
meanwhile, abbvie laid out $2.68 million during this year's first three months, astrazeneca spent $1.06 million, bristol-myers paid $1.2 million, j&j shelled out $1.46 million, merck ran through $2.76 million, pfizer disbursed $4.2 million and sanofi, $1.67 million.

markets have generally been 'risk off' over the past week, they said, as covid-19 cases rise and the likelihood of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021 has diminished.
if president joe biden cannot gather enough bipartisan support for his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, democrats will look to another way to get at least some of it through on a simple senate majority with 51 votes.
biden also favors bipartisan legislation offering greater protections for older workers against being workforce discrimination due to their age.
a public health jobs corps might be an option for experienced workers looking for encore careers.
in attacking institutions from the fbi to the centers for disease control and prevention, trump is hollowing out the governmental structure. in imposing pointless obstacles that lead to trade wars, he has alienated america's allies. in his admiration for dictators and authoritarian leaders, he is helping them to establish 21st-century fascism. and his chronic lying from the office of the president undermines the people's confidence in their government.
the report released thursday projected 2016 enrollment of 12 million, one million less than the agency's projection of 13 million just two months ago, and significantly less than a 21 million estimate a year ago.
obama is concerned with a near-term global economic shock from a u.k. withdrawal from the european union, which would be felt mostly keenly, of course, by big corporations.
$15 minimum wage: probably not. mandates have a speckled history in reconciliation in general and even then the size of a minimum wage hike on the federal budget would likely make it too small to be more than merely incidental. a broader analysis of its economic impact could show a larger effect but that would be similar to republicans' failed effort to use dynamic scoring to show a smaller revenue loss from tax cuts in 2017.
now, more than 12,000 starbucks employees participate in the program and nearly 3,000 have graduated, she said.
the outlays to influence the federal government hit $3.47 billion in 2019, the biggest total since 2010's spending of $3.51 billion. the annual figures, shown in the chart below, come from a center for responsive politics analysis of lobbying disclosures filed through last week.
when asked to comment on its recent lobbying spending, a sanofi spokeswoman said the company regularly engages with policymakers to promote public policies that support patient access to the medicines they need and an environment that promotes and rewards innovation and scientific advancement.
the growth in online education over the past 15 or so years had made it much easier for companies to offer these programs at scale to workers across the country and even around the world. companies are typically partnering with at least one institution with online programs in offering this benefit.
a related hangup is that a reconciliation change must make a change in outlays or revenues or the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues collected, with the meaning of terms and conditions not always clear.
the plan falls well short of universal long-term care coverage, though.
the platform's focus and what's missing
in this environment, a partnership with a company that brings in at least some number of students, guaranteed, is attractive to colleges, said david bergeron, a senior fellow at the center for american progress, a left-leaning tank.

why would they do that? it turns out that many cfos are simply overestimating their company's cost of capital. for example in one survey the average cfo told duke that his company had to pay 10% for its money, even though his own calculations, and public data from the stock and bond markets, meant that the number was only around 6%.

but nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor, is among the experts who have argued that it's not clear how trump's supreme court pick, amy coney barrett, would rule in the suit, which he said is significantly weaker than a past challenge to the aca.
biden's draft platform would give everyone the option of choosing a public health insurance option like medicare. intriguingly, it also proposes lowering the medicare age from 65 to 60, for those who want to enroll earlier than they can today. that would benefit early retirees, whether they were laid off or voluntarily left employment, perhaps to start their own businesses.
the president first started bashing amazon on twitter in december 2015 after polls showed he was the frontrunner to win the republican nomination. the editorial page of the washington post, acquired by bezos a few years earlier, became an early and frequent critic of the future president.
after climbing 410 points on monday, the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% was 0.6%, or 166 points lower in late morning trading. the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% slipped 0.5% and the nasdaq comp, +0.09% was 0.2% down.
the first 100 days of a new job are crucial for both employer and employee. for the employer, those days set the stage of an employer's work ethics and productivity. for an employee, it helps gauge if this was the right move — executives and human resources staff say new hires tend to know if they're going to stay with a job for the long haul within the first six months. plus, keeping track of your work and progress builds good habits.
retirement security and savings: here, the approach is pragmatic rather than bold. the democratic draft platform doesn't favor universal retirement savings plans (an idea floated by various republican and democratic administrations since president carter). i was looking for the word to delink pensions from employers, said ghilarducci. i don't see it.
in a new paper, david blanchflower, and david bell, an economics professor at the university of stirling, argue that, in the wake of the great recession, underemployment is a better measure of labor-market health than the unemployment rate. the fact that millions of workers want to work more hours means that the labor market still has plenty of slack.
kaiser's cox noted that there could be some uptick in the enrollment rates in the next or following years, since a phased-in penalty on being uninsured reached its cap this year. (households will pay $969 on average for remaining uninsured in 2016, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis.)
you might think somebody cynical would say, 'they're just staying until they get a degree' — and so what?, he said.
what employees/potential students should keep in mind
joe biden decisively won south carolina's democratic presidential primary on saturday, according to projections, giving the former vice president his first victory in the 2020 nominating battle and a burst of momentum ahead of the critical super tuesday contests next week.
people have talked about it for a long time, says katz.
biden's campaign may enjoy only a short-lived boost, however, as he faces a steeper test on super tuesday. sanders is topping polls of states including california and texas, and is the front-runner in national surveys, according to realclearpolitics.
the cost of putting food on the table also eased after a big runup in the previous year. food prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 — the smallest gain since 2009 — with most of the increase coming early on. prices had jumped 3.4% in 2014.
companies, now that the labor market is tight, are trying to figure out what's a smart way to attract and, especially, retain employees, said peter cappelli, the director of wharton's center for human resources at the university of pennsylvania. and these programs tend to work in that regard, according to a study conducted by cappelli. he found that offering tuition assistance allows companies to hire better quality and more productive employees, making the cost worth it.

we know the workforce is changing and we believe that our associates want to be in the position to come along on the ride with us, she said.
despite that, it's often seen as a black box — what is allowed under it isn't always clear. that's because, according to experts, it actually isn't clear. the limitations are vague and subject to the whims of the senate parliamentarian, who doesn't provide written guidance.

in fact, biden is calling for increases in social security benefits and no benefit cuts, says teresa ghilarducci, professor of economics at the new school for social research and the director of the schwartz center for economic policy analysis. no sneaky cuts as a result of raising the retirement age.
left unsaid by johnson, of course, is that states as diverse as texas and massachusetts share that authority, not always happily. and the u.s. has ceded authority to international institutions, notably the world trade organization, on key economic issues.
south carolina was widely seen as a must-win for biden, who is aiming to be the moderate alternative to self-described democratic socialist sanders.
arguably the first major example of these programs is a partnership between starbucks sbux, +2.24% and arizona state university that began in 2014. when the program initially launched, the company paid for starbucks employees working an average of 20 hours per week to finish up the last two years of their degree for free through asu's online program. in 2015, the company expanded the program to cover four years of tuition.
so how does the increase in lobbying spending square with president donald trump's promise to drain the swamp?
the parties typically able to negotiate a deal whereby employees have their entire tuition bill covered. under more traditional tuition reimbursement plans, the company money functioned as sort of voucher that offset the cost partly, but not completely. but this new setup also means that to receive the benefit, employees have to attend specific schools and in some cases earn specific credentials.
the focus is less on starting with what universities have, but more on starting with the actual problem the organization is facing, and translating that into how a university can help the employer, the employee and the community, he said.
i'll buy another tranche of these same puts if the stock markets rally another 2%-3% in the next couple of weeks. i'll still be net long overall in my personal portfolio, as i have plenty of long revolution investment stocks that i want to hold steady. but i'd rather start hedging while our portfolios are through the roof, especially given the current setup for the stock market and the election.

the new rash of tuition help is geared towards a different audience — low-wage workers who may not have a college degree. they're also typically structured differently. with these new initiatives, the company often pays the employee's tuition directly to the school through an agreement the two parties have worked out. in some cases the programs are facilitated through a third party that processes the tuition payments and allows workers to access the courses and degrees offered relatively seamlessly.
after the financial crisis, former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke pushed zero interest rates and quantitative easing to get companies to invest more in the economy. he figured that zirp and qe would drive down the cost of capital for corporations. they did. but he, and everyone else, has been baffled that this hasn't unleashed quite the flood of new investment that you'd expect. and now we know why.

another important part of the first 100 days is to create a network of people you can talk to — get to know people, be friendly with everyone around you, whether they're above or below you on the ranks, and build relationships, larssen said. these friendships help employees feel connected to their jobs — about two-thirds of 716 full-time workers with six or more workplace friends said they loved their company, and 55% said work relationships were very to extremely important to their quality of life, according to a 2014 workforce mood tracker report conducted by employee recognition firm globoforce.
for example, it doesn't include much to benefit middle-income recipients of long-term care and their families, howard gleckman, senior fellow at the urban institute, recently wrote for forbes. these are the millions of people who are not poor enough to be eligible for medicaid, but do not have sufficient resources to purchase assistance on their own, he said.
the biden-harris bernie sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda would bankrupt u.s. taxpayers and eliminate quality access to health care for millions of americans, said ken farnaso, deputy national press secretary. president trump has fought to safeguard patients with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, lower premiums, and will always put the health of patients first. the choice couldn't be more clear in november.

one week after election day, the supreme court will hear arguments in a case filed by an array of republican attorneys general seeking to strike down the aca, known an obamacare. with the individual mandate penalty now at $0, the entire law falls apart, they argue.
this report was first published on jan. 27, 2020.
whether that is a reason for the u.k. to stay is another matter. but the very last thing obama should be accused of is populism.
it's because major employers from mcdonald's mcd, -0.27% to disney dis, -1.28% have launched or expanded programs that allow some of their employees to attend certain colleges and take certain courses on the company's dime. walmart wmt, -0.03% announced in june that the retail giant would extend its educational assistance benefits program to high school students. through the program, teens working at walmart will have access to flexible schedules, free standardized test prep and up to seven hours of free college credit.

trump on friday night urged republicans to vote in south carolina's democratic primary, and pick who he described as the weakest candidate. the state's open primary means voters may participate in any contest. south carolina's republican party canceled its primary, one of just a handful of states to scrap gop nominating contests this cycle.

the federal government's efforts to rein in pharmaceutical prices have included bills that aim to deter pharma companies from blocking or delaying generic competition, as well as a trump administration plan to curb rebates that have gone to pharmacy benefit managers. in addition, another bill would require drug makers to justify large price hikes and high launch prices.

ask your boss for regular meetings, where you can both track progress, larssen said. people tend to wait until the boss says now is the time to check in, she said, but being proactive is a better choice, she added. employees who had routine meetings with their managers were almost three times as likely to be engaged in their jobs than those who didn't have meetings, according to a 2015 gallup survey. also, if anything is in fact misaligned with your job description or what was discussed during the interview, talk about that too — just make sure to bring solutions to the problems you want to bring up, salemi said. and always mention how what you want or need can help the business.
balancing work and school often means students may struggle to make it through the program in a timely fashion. in addition, achieving success through online programs — what many of these partnerships offer — can be particularly challenging for students who have traditionally struggled in higher education.
health care was the leading issue among south carolina's democratic voters, according to the associated press. sanders' agenda includes medicare for all, canceling student debt and reducing income inequality, and president donald trump has been eager to paint the vermont senator and other democrats as a threat to american prosperity and the u.s. stock market djia, -0.39% , even as it reels from the coronavirus outbreak. stocks just wrapped up their worst week since 2008.
sure, you wouldn't ok a project unless it offered a healthy return over your cost of capital. you want to make a profit, and you want a margin of safety. but demanding a return that's twice your cost of capital is quite something.
one facet of obamacare is that it expanded medicaid eligibility. the cbo now expects a bump in medicaid sign-ups — up to 11 million enrolled this year and 15 million by 2026, per the report — citing new economic projections and a decrease in the share of future wage growth projected to go to lower-income people.

still, analysts like gleckman applaud biden for grasping the need for better long-term care support and services.
biden, having grown up in the steelmaking region of pennsylvania, can hardly be blind to the deprivations and pain of low-paid workers. so, if elected, we would have a president responsive to legislative initiatives for subsidies designed to pull up these workers' meager compensation.
with the eyes of the world set to be on trump and biden later on tuesday, the goldman strategist said the first debate could be an important catalyst for investors to assess risks.
and indeed, novola said the tuition assistance is attractive to prospective employees. roughly 60% of new hires said they're interested in learning more about the program and 17% of applicants said the perk is the driving reason they applied to work at starbucks.
ideally, tuition benefit programs are designed in a way that address a skills gap within an employer's workforce or other challenge a company may be facing, said vivek sharma, the chief executive officer of instride, a company launched out of arizona state university this year that helps employers design and manage these programs.

in the early 1980s, democratic sen. robert byrd of west virginia, already suspicious of anything that allowed bills to bypass normal senate rules, was alarmed by the number of extraneous measures his fellow senators were trying to stuff into a reconciliation bill. (according to one expert consulted for this article, bipartisan policy center senior vice president bill hoagland, it was a provision dealing with coast guard user fees that a senator had been previously unable to pass that drew byrd's ire.)
for workers without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, biden would offer employers incentives to create automatic 401(k)s for employees.
underscoring washington's interest in lowering drug prices, white house press secretary sarah sanders on april 30 said president donald trump and top democratic lawmakers agreed during a much-anticipated infrastructure meeting that they should get together again in the near future to discuss prices for prescription medicines. trump feels drug prices should be much lower than they are today, sanders also said.
it's not like i'm changing my stance, but the time to hedge is when you can and not when you have to. but the election looms, and those who want clinton or trump and think that their candidate will be best for the stock market will become increasingly worried about the possibility that their candidate will lose.
companies that offer these programs say they're a valuable investment in their workforce. disney, launched its aspire program last year with an initial investment of $150 million over five years and plans to add up to $25 million more each year. thousands of employees are taking classes through the program, bob iger, disney's ceo told shareholders in march. nothing would make me happier than if we had 100% of our eligible cast members take full advantage of this opportunity, he said.
