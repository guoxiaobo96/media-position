5 things to watch as gop health bill moves to the senate

after weeks of will-they-or-won't-they tensions, the house managed to pass its gop replacement for the affordable care act on thursday by a razor-thin margin. the vote was 217-213.
democrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. as the republicans reached a majority for the bill, democrats on the house floor began chanting, na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. they say republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.
now the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the capitol to the senate. and the job doesn't get any easier. with only a two-vote republican majority and likely no democratic support, it would take only three gop no votes to sink the bill.
democrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of americans and break the bank for millions more, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y.
it's the senate's turn house passage of the american health care act is just a first step. as this measure moves to the senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. among them: medicaid: the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.

and republicans in the senate have their own internal disagreements, too.
here are five of the biggest flashpoints that could make trouble for the bill in the senate.
house leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent house debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.
for the first time, federal funding for low-income people on medicaid would be limited, resulting in what house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative national review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. it's a longtime goal for many conservatives. we've been dreaming of this since i've been around, ryan said.
but it is not a consensus position in the party. some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. in addition, many gop governors took the federal government's offer in the aca of near-complete federal funding to expand medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.
the house bill, wrote the republican governors of ohio, michigan, arkansas and nevada in a letter to house and senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.
that pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some gop senators. rob portman, r-ohio; bill cassidy, r-la.; and shelley moore capito, r-w.va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the house bill, as has dean heller, r-nev., it's not clear whether any of the house changes have satisfied those senators.
increase in number of uninsured people
the congressional budget office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many senate lawmakers. you can't sugarcoat it, cassidy told fox news when explaining that it's an awful score. the final house bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.
and democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the house or the senate to stop the bill or change it.
the cbo's estimate makes clear that trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of american families, said schumer. tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.
on one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by house leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the affordable care act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. the cbo estimated that under the original version of the house bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.
that brought a strong rebuke from the powerful aarp, which was an outspoken aca supporter. although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.
sen. susan collins, r-maine, has said she could not support the house bill in its original form because of concerns about the effects on older constituents.
on the other hand, some conservatives in the senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. ted cruz, r-texas; mike lee, r-utah; and rand paul, r-ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the aca, with paul referring to it as obamacare lite. they worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.
for me, it's a big stumbling block still that there's taxpayer money that's being given to insurance companies, paul told reporters in late april. and i'm just not in favor of taxpayer money going to insurance companies.
as republicans have been vowing for years, the house-passed bill would defund planned parenthood, although only for a year. that's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the cbo, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for medicaid. birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.
but while cutting funding for planned parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the house, there are a handful of gop senators, including collins and lisa murkowski, r-alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.
the budget process republicans are using to avoid a democratic filibuster in the senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. it will be up to the senate parliamentarian, a republican appointee, to make those determinations.
that's why the bill does not wipe away all the aca's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.
some analysts have suggested that the house amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the senate's byrd rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.
it could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the committee for a responsible federal budget in a blog post.
even rep. mark meadows, r-n.c., who negotiated that amendment that won the backing of conservatives, conceded that it could prove problematic in the senate. there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before we can celebrate and all go home, he said in an interview outside the house chamber.
democrats say it is one of several provisions in the house bill that might not pass parliamentary muster in the senate.
for example, analysts have suggested that the gop replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass byrd rule scrutiny either. that's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.
a third potentially problematic element of the original house bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the affordable care act. that provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.

dr. martens footwear brand is planning london ipo

the owner of dr. martens, the famed british footwear brand, is planning an initial public offering on the london stock exchange, according to a filing on monday.
private equity owner permira is expected to sell at least 25% of the business. the brand, which evolved into a symbol of rebellious youth culture, has continued to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic. dr. martens sells more than 11 million pairs a year in more than 60 countries.
the boot, which became a counterculture style icon in the 1960s, was created in 1945 by a former german soldier, dr. klaus maertens. according to the company's official history, he designed a prototype with an air-cushioned sole to help his broken foot heal. larger-scale production began two years later, and, because of its comfort, the company says, the shoe was initially popular with older women.
in 1960, england's griggs family, who were shoe manufacturers, bought exclusive licensing rights to the boot and began selling it to mail carriers and factory workers.
the image of the workaday boot began to change when skinheads decided to sport them in the 1960s. soon after, the who's pete townshend began wearing them to emphasize his own working-class pride — and the doc marten was on its way to becoming a cultural symbol.
in the ensuing decades, various youth tribes embraced the boot, including punks and early goths as well as schoolgirls, american grunge musicians and celebrities including drew barrymore, miley cyrus and gigi hadid.
in the early 2000s, however, sales declined so much the company had to close factories to avoid bankruptcy.
in 2014, permira bought the brand for about $400 million. sales have surged from $220 million that year to more than $900 million in the year ending march 2020.
there have been some concerns about quality. in britain's guardian newspaper, some readers complained in 2019 about soles and stitching coming off, and suggested the problems were the result of offshoring manufacturing to china. but permira insists quality standards have not changed since the original owner, r. griggs group, moved production of the boot from england to china more than a decade and a half ago.
how to caucus with a baby
ahead of the iowa caucuses this week, lyz lenz, a staff writer for the cedar rapids gazette, posed to readers this question. how do you caucus with a baby? she says parents want to caucus and participate in the frenetic atmosphere of rallies and politicking. but it's just not that easy with a child in tow. lyz lenz joins us from cedar rapids. welcome.
lyz lenz: thank you for having me.
montagne: and tell us about what got you thinking about this question.
lenz: well, i am a mom. i have an 8-year-old and a 6-year-old. and i've tried to caucus with babies. i tried to caucus with babies in 2016, and it was really, really hard. and so this time around, in 2020, with all the new caucus rules, i wanted to know how women were making it work. it's also a year, you know, where we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. and we have - we've had, you know, so many female candidates running for the democratic nomination. so i wanted to know how women were making it work.
montagne: you do declare in your column that iowa's mothers are - even after the 19th amendment, women got the vote but are still disenfranchised from caucusing. but, you know, let me just push you on this little. i know how hard it is. but considering that this caucus date is famous throughout the land, doesn't a mother or both parents have time to kind of save up and get a babysitter for that one important date?
lenz: you know (laughter), you say that, but anybody with small children knows how hard it is to plan, how unpredictable it is. you know, some children are high needs. even in 2020, two-thirds of women are still the primary caretakers of their children. and it puts an additional burden on women, people with families to pay to play. and i think that's essentially, you know, what is at the heart of this - is that, at its nature, a caucus is a self-limiting process.
montagne: well, you know, i did scroll through a bunch of the tweets that responded to this. and there were - a lot of them were different. some telling their story, like, you...
montagne: ...just were talking about. but there's - some of those answers to how to caucus with a baby is cut out caucuses and give us a chance just to go to a ballot box for a minute and put in my ballot. i was a little surprised. like, change the system.
lenz: well, that's the conversation that we're having nationally - that people are really coming to terms with how limiting this caucus is, how inaccessible it is for older americans, americans with children, americans with disabilities, americans who work multiple jobs who can't get time off. and so a lot of iowans are saying, why can't we just have a primary? but the answer to that is new hampshire. they would not be happy if we moved from our first-in-the-nation caucuses to a first-in-the-nation primary, which they are. so it's a small, local issue. but it also is reflective of the issues facing the democratic party nationwide.
montagne: so given all of this, what about you? are you going to be able to caucus yourself even though you're, you know, a columnist for a newspaper? i mean, what's going on?
lenz: yeah. so because i am an opinion columnist, i am allowed to caucus. and i will be going to caucus. i do have two small children. but i'm also divorced. we have 50/50 custody. and my partner is a republican, and they have a very polite primary. so he will be taking the kids for the night. and i'll be caucusing and then working all night. so it works out for us. but i would like it to work out for every woman in america.
montagne: that was lyz lenz of the cedar rapids gazette in iowa. thanks for joining us.
lenz: thank you so much for having me.

brandi carlile: (singing) he wasn't really known for breaking the rules when he arrived in the second year of my high school. he wasn't so...
the singer brandi carlile has a big voice. and at age 36, she has already enjoyed a big career. she's topped folk charts, earned grammy nominations, smashed nashville stereotypes. now carlile has other things on her mind.
carlile: (reading) whoever's reading this, your parents will die. you may have been hurt or loved by them - probably both. but can you forgive them for leaving in the end?
kelly: that passage is from the liner notes of brandi carlile's new album, which is called, appropriately, by the way, i forgive you. and she joins me now from our new york bureau. welcome.
carlile: thank you very much for having me. wow, what an honor.
kelly: it's a pleasure to have you. let me start with that topic of forgiveness. it's such a big thing to tackle. what made you decide to take it on?
carlile: well, it kind of appeared out of my record and my writing process like a sculpture would appear when you take the pieces of stone away that don't belong. it's really radical and ugly, difficult process that comes - great beauty comes from it.
kelly: and you write about it specifically in regard to your parents in one of the songs on here. this is the song most of all.
(soundbite of song, most of all)
carlile: (singing) i haven't seen my father in some time, but his face is always staring back at me. his heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms, and my colors change like the sea.
i watched both my parents lose their mothers last year, and it was really interesting because throughout the process of growing up - my parents had me when they were real young, and i listened to all of their grievances and gripes about their mamas. and as soon as those women were gone, it was like all memory of any of that was immediately - had just evaporated. there are people that could criticize the way that we react towards our loved ones when they're gone and say that we make them inhuman or perfect, but then there is, you know, the argument to be made that suddenly we see things for real for the first time.
kelly: or you let yourself forget, which is a line i loved in this song where you're writing about, you know, maybe forgetting is the first step to forgiving.
(soundbite of song, most of all)
carlile: (singing) but most of all, he taught me to forgive, how to keep a cool head, how to love the one you're with and, when i'm far into the distance and the pushing comes to shove, to remember what comes back when you give away your love. give away your love.
kelly: you write about the process of becoming a mother and how that changed you. it's another song called the mother on here. let me - i wonder if we can hear a little bit of that.
carlile: (singing) welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind. you're tethered to another, and you're worried all the time. you always know the melody, but you never heard it rhyme.
kelly: that very first line there, welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind...
carlile: (laughter) it's so true, man. curse it.
kelly: why, 'cause she's always in there with you, your daughter?
carlile: yeah. it was actually - a really interesting woman called trina shoemaker, a good friend of mine, really mystical, crazy person - she told me when the baby was born 'cause i finished that record, like, 72 hours before the birth of evangeline, and...
carlile: yeah. and she said to me - she goes, welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind. you'll never be alone in there again. there'll never be a day where you don't wake up wondering what evangeline needs - not when she's 50. and boy is that the truth.
kelly: it is. how old is evangeline now?
carlile: she's going to be 4.
kelly: what's her reaction to that song when you play it for her?
carlile: she knows it's about her. she loves it. but any of the bad stuff she doesn't associate to her. she asks me things like, mama, who was the lady in the song that trashed your car?
carlile: i'm like, you are the lady in the song that trashed my damn car.
kelly: who's thrown cheerios into every receptacle of my life.
carlile: oh, yes, just somehow you're just sticky. i don't know why.
carlile: (singing) they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine 'cause i am the mother of evangeline.
kelly: i want to ask you about a different story. you took to social media recently and asked people to share stories of people they forgive or wish they could forgive. and you told a story of your own about a pastor.
kelly: would you share it with us?
carlile: that whole campaign is - by the way, shook me to the core, seeing the people - things that people are forgiving people for. i stopped reading it when i got to one that - woman forgave someone that ran over her 7-year-old little girl. and the one that you're talking about, you know, is a specific hurt to only me. but i was young, and i was in a baptist church - a pretty good one. i had committed myself to baptism. and the pastor let me go through the process. you know, there's kind of a process prior to getting baptized where you have to do a lot commitments and...
kelly: right. you have to meet with the pastor and...
carlile: yeah, and then you get, you know...
carlile: right, and then your family and your friends come, and they sit in the church. and they wait. and it's, like, after hours. it's not on a church day. and you get, you know, dunked in the water (laughter), which i was always nervous about. and i just remember walking to the church with my bathing suit on under my clothes and pastor tim telling me that he couldn't do it.
kelly: that he couldn't do it why?
carlile: he couldn't do it because i was gay and because i wouldn't say that i wasn't going to change that or that i could change that. and...
kelly: and how old were you?
kelly: and he waited till you had your whole family and your friends and everybody there?
carlile: he did, yeah. he called me for days and days afterwards begging for my forgiveness and said that he just struggled with it for so long that he just ran out of time and that he thought he was going to do it right up until the time but that he just couldn't. and it took me a long time to forgive him. and it threatened my faith and my self-worth. so i was like, well, if i'm asking other people to do it, i'm going to do it (laughter). so i did it, and it feels weird, and it feels weird right now.
(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)
carlile: (singing) i run a lot of miles of life and crime of mountain climbs and quitting times, packing that load of lying rhymes and tired jokes and wooden dimes. i've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend.
kelly: i want to ask about the song hold out your hand. you write about all - you have a big, long note when you write about a lot of the songs on this album paragraph after paragraph. for the song hold out your hand, you have one sentence you write, and i'm going to quote it to you. you write, sometimes when the weight of the world feels too much, i want to dance with a redneck and shotgun a beer. and i have to say, i read that, and i wrote down in my own handwriting, hell yes.
(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)
carlile: (singing) hold out your hand. take hold of mine now. round and round we go.
oh, yeah. i love people so much, you know? i love people that don't think the same way i think. and i do want to hold out my hand and be joined to other people that are different than me at the end of the day.
(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)
carlile: (singing) the hand comes around, and the trumpet sounds. and his number calls. and the moment he falls in the haunted halls of man, he will understand. he will comprehend. he will not pretend. he will not pretend
kelly: thank you so much, brandi.
carlile: thank you so much. what a great chat.
kelly: that was the singer brandi carlile talking about her new album, which is titled by the way, i forgive you.
(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)
carlile: (singing) ...as you can take. the devil don't take a break. that devil don't take a break. the devil don't take a break.

congressional republicans lobby trump to back down on tariffs
enlarge this image toggle caption evan vucci/ap evan vucci/ap
fears of economic and political backlash are motivating senior congressional republicans to move forward this week with public and private lobbying efforts aimed at getting president trump to change his mind about tariffs he intends to levy on steel and aluminium imports.
we are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the white house to not advance with this plan, ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., said in a statement. the new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.
president trump downplayed congressional gop concerns. i don't think you're going to have a trade war, he said monday at the white house, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. people have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. everybody.
the president noted that his efforts to renegotiate nafta continue as well. we are renegotiating nafta as i said i would, and if we don't make a deal i will terminate nafta, he warned.
congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.
ways and means committee chairman kevin brady, r-texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, david reichert, r-wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. they are seeking additional signatures from house republicans. aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader gop can get behind.
as the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for american businesses and consumers, lauren aronson, a spokeswoman for the ways and means committee, said in a statement.
senate finance chairman orrin hatch, r-utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the gop's tax cuts. should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, american manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, hatch said in a weekend statement.
the white house showed no indication monday that the president was considering changing his mind. the president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen, said national trade council director peter navarro, a top trump aide who, along with commerce secretary wilbur ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.
understand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on k street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the american worker and on behalf of the country, navarro said. this is a very well-informed decision.
trump's decision is the starkest break from traditional gop economic philosophy on trade since taking office. the president has found few gop allies on capitol hill, but rust belt democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. this welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of chinese cheating, said sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio. likewise, sen. bob casey, d-pa., called trump's decision a welcome step.
republicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to trump in several recent meetings. south dakota sen. john thune, one of the top republicans in the senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when trump made the announcement.
i don't know how to explain it because i've been in meetings with him on trade, thune told reporters. everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.
sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like china for dumping low-cost steel in the american market. graham said sunday that trump would let china off the hook while punishing u.s. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. the reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of china dumping, graham said in an interview on cbs's face the nation. china produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. china is your problem, mr. president.
congress technically has legislative options to counter trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. and any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.
from the moment a carnegie mellon researcher figured out that a colon and a parenthesis could make a face, the internet has provided its own unique additions to popular culture. lolcats, rickrolling and star wars kid are just a few examples of an entirely new form of culture that came into its own over the past decade: the internet meme.
internet memes are basically nonsensical inside jokes that spiral off through the web. for example, you might have been sent a link to see a video of, say, nancy pelosi's cats. and right in the middle, the whole video might change to a 1987 video of rick astley singing never gonna give you up. that's the classic online prank known as rickrolling –- tricking the user into watching something they didn't mean to see.
the emoticon, that sideways smiley — that's kind of the first internet meme, kenyatta cheese tells npr's guy raz. cheese is co-founder of knowyourmeme.com. he says internet memes got their start in the early '80s with online bulletin board systems.
people would meet and kind of talk about stuff and jokes would emerge that only made sense in the context of the bulletin board, cheese says.
these days the most successful memes tend to cluster around certain subjects. cute babies, cute pets and violence, cheese says.
internet memes is a new space that kind of occupies a place that television can't. that newspapers can't, he says. it requires people to go out and create the culture themselves. and, honestly, i have a lot more fun creating culture and spreading it as opposed to the just sitting back and watching tv.
'news of the world' filmmaker wanted to explore the 'healing power of storytelling'
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. i just watched a new movie that both transported me away from this time of covid and insurrection, yet seemed relevant to both. it's set in texas in 1870, five years after the civil war has ended, when many texans are bitter about defeat and reluctant to rejoin the union, which would require agreeing to the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which includes the abolition of slavery.
one of the first images we see in the film is of a black man hanging from a tree. white settlers are fighting native americans. everyone is hurting. the film is a western called news of the world. it stars tom hanks. my guest is the director, paul greengrass, who previously directed hanks in the film captain phillips.
in news of the world, hanks plays a former confederate captain, jefferson kyle kidd, who fought in the texas infantry during the civil war and surrendered in 1865. the film is set five years later, when kidd is a lonely man with unspoken regrets, eking out a living, traveling from one small, poor texas town and muddy settlement to another, reading aloud the news from newspapers around the country as a form of information and entertainment to gatherings of people, charging 10 cents a person.
(soundbite of film, news of the world)
tom hanks: (as captain kidd) good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
hanks: (as captain kidd) it's good to be back with you all here in wichita falls. my name is captain jefferson kyle kidd, and i'm here tonight to bring y'all the news from across this great world of ours. now, i know how life is in these parts, working your trade sunup to sundown, no time for reading newspapers. am i correct?
hanks: (as captain kidd) but we do that work for you. and maybe just for tonight we can escape our troubles and hear the great changes that are happening out there.
hanks: (as captain kidd) starting local, then - our own houston telegraph from the 1 of february, this news. the meningitis epidemic continues to spread without prejudice across the panhandle and north texas region. so far, it has claimed 97 souls in just a two-month period. in federal news, our own dallas herald...
gross: the director of news of the world, paul greengrass, started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker. he went on to make films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. captain phillips was based on the american cargo ship hijacked by somali pirates in 2009. 22 july was about the terrorist attack in norway in 2011 by a far-right extremist. united 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died, crashing near shanksville, pa. greengrass also directed three of the blockbuster jason bourne movies. news of the world is in theaters now and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow.
paul greengrass, welcome to fresh air. and thank you for making this new movie.
paul greengrass: oh, my pleasure. good to be here.
gross: so although this movie is set in 1870, it's feeling so current to me, like i said. you know, america still hasn't reckoned with the ongoing racism and racial injustice resulting from slavery, and we haven't fully recovered from the divisions of the civil war. i mean, one of the images of the insurrection is a man inside the capitol building holding a very large confederate flag on a long pole. and of course, one of the first things we see in your film is a black man hanging from a tree with a sign attached to him reading, texas says no, this is white man's country. did the movie feel current to you when you were making it?
greengrass: it did. i felt when i read the novel that it's based on - paulette jiles' wonderful novel news of the world - that there was something about texas in 1870 in the shadow of the civil war, america bitterly divided, uncertain where she wants to go, desperately searching for healing, but not being able to find it. and this character of the lonely newsreader, a character who'd lost everything in the civil war - all he has is a satchel with some old newspapers. and he wanders, as you say, from town to town, reading the news for anyone who wants to hear it.
and in a way, i think what he has is the healing power of storytelling. you know, by telling these stories - the local news, the news of the meningitis epidemics, the federal news, news from far, far away - he draws his audience into a relationship with him. and, you know, i think that telling stories is a healing activity. it draws the storyteller and the audience together.
gross: a central part of the plot is that the man who he sees hanging from a tree at the beginning of the movie, he was transporting a 10-year-old girl to her aunt and uncle. the girl had been kidnapped six years earlier, kidnapped and raised by kiowa indians after they killed her parents. and now her kiowa family has been killed by white people, so she has been twice orphaned. and the black man who we see hanging from a tree, he was tasked with taking her to her only remaining white family and aunt and uncle. so now with that man dead, she has nothing and no means of getting anywhere on her own.
hanks finds her, the captain finds her, and reluctantly takes on the responsibility of taking her, johanna, to her aunt and uncle. it's a pretty long and dangerous journey, and a lot happens to them along the way. and it's hard for him to communicate with her because she only speaks kiowa, and she identifies as a member of the kiowa. did you read a lot of history about that period?
greengrass: i did. i did. there's quite an extensive literature, actually, for these children who were kidnapped. it wasn't that unusual. and they were lost children, of course. but, you know, part of a wider landscape of lost people, i think. pretty much everybody in the movie has - lives in the shadow of the civil war, lives in the shadow of loss. and their journey, kidd and this little girl's journey, which begins wordlessly, is ultimately a journey towards finding a place to belong, i suppose, in this new landscape.
and that, to me, felt inspiring and also was ultimately the reason why i made the film. you know, i wanted to make it because in lots of ways, it's a film about the journey to hope, and that's something that's very important, i think. as the world looks ever more dark, we have to keep our minds fixed, i think, on where the hope is.
gross: so were there newsreaders like the character tom hanks plays, who actually were itinerant and read the news from town to town for people who didn't have access to newspapers?
greengrass: i think, yes. of course, many people were illiterate in those days, weren't they? i mean, i think...
greengrass: the newsreaders, really, have a gospel route. in my country, they would have been the methodist preachers, the nonconformist preachers who weren't allowed to preach in the churches but went out into the town squares and brought the good news. and of course, that - later after the american revolution, they were a feature of american life, too. and of course, what starts as bringing the good news becomes bringing the news, you know. and they would leaven their gospel stories with local news, and so it became, steadily, the news.
gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is paul greengrass, the director of the new film news of the world, starring tom hanks. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to the interview i recorded tuesday with film director paul greengrass. his new film news of the world stars tom hanks. it's a western set in texas in 1870, five years after the end of the civil war. greengrass got his start as a journalist and documentary filmmaker and went on to make films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. his films include captain phillips and united 93. he also directed three jason bourne films.
you've studied the work of john ford, who did a lot of westerns, including the searchers and my darling clementine, she wore a yellow ribbon, the man who shot liberty valance. you not only studied his work; you talked about him in the documentary series five came back, which is adapted from a book by the same name. and it was about five directors, including ford, who during world war ii basically joined the military and did documentary films about battles as they were happening. for ford, that included the battle of midway and d-day. like, he was there shooting footage from d-day.
and when you were looking at those films that he shot during the war, could you imagine yourself doing that? i mean, you talk about how in the battle of midway, when the japanese are attacking midway island from the air, that john ford was standing on basically a pedestal, directing things so he could have a good vision of what was happening. and as you point out, if during an air war, you're standing in an elevated area, you are a target. could you imagine doing that?
greengrass: well, i don't think i could imagine being in the battle of midway. but, you know, when i was a young man, when i was in my 20s, that was my job. i mean, i went to conflict zones, many of them - middle east, central america, apartheid south africa, philippines during the revolution, after - as marcos fell. you know, that was what i did for the best part of 10 years.
and obviously, they weren't anything like in scale, you know, world war ii. but the same principles apply if you see, you know, planes coming in - you get down and, you know, do the best you can. it was a young man's occupation. but it marked me, of course. any exposure to reality in film profoundly shapes you. it's profoundly shaped my life. it's profoundly shaped my aesthetic. it's profoundly shaped what i'm interested in.
gross: you say it shaped your aesthetic. can you talk a little bit more about how it shaped your aesthetic? and i mean that in two ways. you know, in five came back, you talk about how the war footage that john ford shot, you can see the film, like, moving out of the sprockets because of all of the impact of the bombs. and you see the camera shaking. some of the footage looks like it's singed from all the bombs exploding. just on a film level, he kept that. you know, he - i think he wanted you to see, like, this is an example of even the damage it's doing to the film.
greengrass: the struggle to create and capture the image, the drama of the experience of the battle of midway. that's at the heart of it, and it's at the heart of all news reportage when you get down to it. what did we see last week? some cameras followed that mob into the capitol building, and you saw those men and women struggling to capture those images in order to bring them to us. your job is to move towards the trouble. that's what you have to do. and the best of those, they have an instinct to where to go.
i mean, this was the key to ford in the battle of midway. he knew where to go, which is up high, to get those images. extraordinary - at great risk to himself, of course. but that's at the heart of it. and there are many, many, many children of papa ford, if i can put it that way, over the decades since who've taken that lesson, and you see it every day on television.
gross: now, you've shot films based on real-life events, like the united flight 93 on 9/11 that crashed because the passengers were taking over the plane from the hostage-takers, and they prevented the plane from crashing into its intended target. you know, you did a film based on the somali pirates who took over, you know, a cargo ship. and then you've also done these, like, big, like, jason bourne movies, which are not exactly cinema verite (laughter). they're not exactly like documentary. they're action films.
and then in the new movie, news of the world, the longest, like, action sequence in it is - it's a shootout between tom hanks and three kind of twisted, lost souls who want to basically buy the young girl from tom hanks and probably sell her into sexual servitude. but that scene, it's just like a really lo-fi shootout, you know, with tom hanks trying to hide behind rocks and use whatever he can as bullets to shoot at these three guys. can you talk a little bit about, like, the different kinds of action sequences that you've shot, after shooting real combat?
greengrass: well, you have to go back to my roots, as - you know, in britain, there wasn't - there isn't - wasn't then, anyway, certainly, a film industry. there was the television industry. that's where you went if you - you know, to work and cut your teeth and pay your dues and learn your craft. and what i was at a very young age was sent out into the world - you were sent out into the world with a crew, and you had to bring back a story from the world in action. and that meant going to places where, if it wasn't armed conflict, it was political conflict. and so that, i suppose, verite sense, that documentary eye, that instinct to capture images rather than to create them, you know, in a sort of curated way - which is really what drama shooting is - has never left me. that's my instinct.
and i brought that to the bourne movies, too, by the way. you know, i think one of the reasons why young people particularly liked the bourne movies is because it was one of the first kind of movies that brought that kind - those kinds of images into the mainstream because that's what kids were used to. they were using - beginning to use their mobile phones and have all sorts of rough and raw and ready verite images, and that was their language. and bourne, i think, just brought that language into the mainstream of hollywood cinema. now it's much more normal to see it.
gross: you know, i'm wondering, having been in so many conflict zones and shot documentaries there and now watching news footage from your home in england, news footage of an insurrection in the united states - in the united states - what is it like for you to watch that, to know that, you know, it's not an emerging democracy, it's not a country where there has been just a super long history of authoritarian governments and dictatorships - it's the united states?
greengrass: well, i first came to the united states when i was 18 years old. and it's not my home country. i'm british. but it's a place i love, as i think many people who are not americans do, you know. it's the great hope of our world, you know. so my feelings are of great shock and sadness, as i think most people's are.
what did i think when i watched it? the last film i made was 22 july about anders breivik, who's a right-wing terrorist in norway who attacked the government and the young labour group as well. you know, it was an attempt to decapitate the state. the reason i made that film was because breivik, anders breivik, is a very important figure in the growth of the far-right, both in america and in the u.k. and across europe, because he's seen as a standard-bearer. if you look at charlottesville, all that trouble, a lot of the language that was being used by the white supremacists was breivik's words from breivik's manifesto - same in some of the other right-wing attacks across europe. you know, he's a profoundly important figure.
gross: so you had to study, like, who he was and, you know, what he believed, what the manifesto was. what are some of the things that you started to believe about how somebody comes to believe lies, how somebody comes to believe that certain people are less than human, that certain people are worthy of being killed and how, like, the truth, reality, is incapable of talking them out of it? because that question is so relevant to right now.
greengrass: i think anders breivik is a dreadful - dreadful - contemptible human being guilty of the most heinous acts. that said, you mustn't ever misunderstand these people. it was not that they thought - that he felt that the people that he killed were not human. he actually understood - he's a pretty intelligent man, anders breivik. what he was - and this is relevant today - was someone who believed that you needed to have a fight, that the battle needed to be waged with violence.
and that is common now. that is - the genie is out of the bottle, if i can use that expression. do you know what i mean? it's like, that is out there in chatrooms, in the dark web, in the meetings all across the west. and it's a big problem. and if you talk to anybody in law enforcement - fbi, you know, police, mi5 over here on the - you know, in europe - the growth of the far-right and their desire to give battle is a real - it's a reality. it's a reality, and it has to be dealt with.
and i think you may be actually a little fortunate in the u.s. i don't know. i mean, obviously, i'm just an observer. but it strikes me that - i suspect that there may have been some overreaching, and law enforcement may really significantly go after these people and, you know, drive them back. but it's going to be a generational struggle, this - just as it is against, you know, violent islamist extremism. and it's part of the morbid symptoms of the failure of centrist politics.
gross: my guest is director paul greengrass, his new film news of the world stars tom hanks. it's now in theaters and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. we'll talk more after we take a short break. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview i recorded tuesday with paul greengrass, who directed the new film news of the world, starring tom hanks. it will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. greengrass started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker and went on to direct theatrical films based on real events. captain phillips, which also starred tom hanks, was based on the american cargo ship hijacked by somali pirates in 2009. 22 july was about a 2011 terrorist attack by a far-right extremist in norway. and united 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died crashing near shanksville, pa. greengrass has also directed three of the blockbuster jason bourne movies.
i want to get back to anders breivik because you did a dramatized version of him in your film 22 july. and he's the neo-nazi, you know, terrorist who attacked people in norway and had a manifesto that a lot of people on the far right have subsequently followed. i am sometimes surprised that people who are neo-nazis, white racists, that they're - i mean, they're proud of it. they believe - i mean, that really - this is how they think the world should be. and they don't mind people knowing that.
greengrass: well, the reason i made that film, 22 july, was because it was not about breivik. i mean, he was a central, important character in it. the film was about norway, as an exemplar, of how a democratic society faced with this menace of white supremacy, how they reacted to this immense threat. you know, i mean, he was a double attack. you know, he blew up the center of government. and then he went and killed the next generation of government leaders when he attacked the youth camp, you know? and it was deliberate. it was an attempt to decapitate the state. that was the whole idea behind it.
and i chose a number of characters who had to respond to that, one of whom was the then-norwegian prime minister, now secretary general of nato, jens stoltenberg. another was the lawyer who represented - who became the state-appointed lawyer for breivik and had to ensure that he had a fair trial as best he could - and then, obviously, the principal character, the family who were caught up in it, the young man who had been grievously wounded by him. and it was about their journeys to face him down. that was what the film was about. and what did that look like and feel like?
so in the end, this young man did face him down in court. but the healing, as far as you could have it after an event like that, was very partial and muted, inevitably, because of the damage he'd done. but it did leave me feeling intensely, as a parent - i mean, how are we going to get out of this? what is the road out of this going to look like? what are the qualities that we have to look to to get through this bitterness and division? that was what was going through my mind. and it was, as i say, six months later - i don't know - that i read news of the world.
and when i read this beautiful novel about this lonely newsreader who embarks on this journey with this mysterious little girl to take her to her surviving family, that is that road out of this. that's - and then, they're just ordinary characters. they're not famous people. they're not in the eye of some enormous storm. they're just - what it says is an attempt to understand kindness, seeing it through, facing down bigotry, standing up, telling the truth. he's a journalist. he stands up, doesn't he? he stands up in the end and says, no, i'm not going to read lies and substitute truth for lies. i'm going to speak my truth. and if necessary, he's prepared to fight for it. and that's heroic and beautiful and exciting. and, of course, it's an adventure, as it should be in a movie, you know?
and in the end, they find a way. and that's, you know, what i wanted. i wanted to make a film i could show my kids, you know, a family film. i've never made a family film. i wanted to do a western and i wanted to do a family film. but i wanted to have the world as i see it in it. but i wanted it to have a happy ending. that's actually, honestly, the truth of it. i wanted to make a film with a happy ending.
gross: that's interesting. how did it feel to make a film with a happy ending?
greengrass: well, that was something that i had decided after i'd done 22 july, you know? i said, i want to make a film that has a happy ending. i want to - you know, not a schmaltzy, sentimental film because i wouldn't - it's not in my sensibility to do that. you know, these things turn around in your mind. it's - i don't know how other filmmakers do it. i can never really sort of go, oh, i need to do a story about x. or i need to do, you know, a science fiction movie, you know? to me, i sort of dwell on a question, a feeling. and one film, it's like a conversation you have with yourself. and you go, ok, well, i need to find a film with a happy ending. i need to find a film - but that feels earned from this world, you know? and, well, what's that going to be? i don't know. god knows.
and then, you know, serendipity - six months later, you read this. and you go, that's it. that's it. and, of course, it's a western. i've never made a western before. that's fantastic, you know? oh, and it's john ford. it starts in reverse. and i did the john ford thing. you know, when you make films, you always have to have a eureka moment, i think, when you go, oh, it's that. this is it. this is the film. i know what to do with this. this is great. it's - all those threads that have been unconnected that i've been turning over in my mind for six months or whatever it is, suddenly, this is the way i can tie them together and get a film, you know? the film will answer that question.
gross: what was your eureka moment when you decided to make the movie about - united 93 - flight 93 on 9/11, where the passengers fought back against the hijackers. but everybody on that plane died as a result because the plane crashed in pennsylvania. i'm going to be really honest with you. i made a decision not to see that movie because, i thought, i know how the story turns out. i've read about it. i don't want to experience the horror of being on that plane. i'm going to spare myself from that. so what was your eureka moment in thinking, like, i want to reenact that in a movie?
greengrass: well, it's difficult if you haven't seen the movie to sort of - i mean, i think it's about a lot more than that, if i can put it that way.
gross: i don't doubt it. so you can tell us.
greengrass: the simple truth about when i decided to make it was when the 7/7 attacks, as we call them in the u.k., occurred some years later, when they bombed three subway trains and a bus in london. and my son, same for many millions of people, i'm sure, in london, he was out and about. when the word came through at 8, 9 o'clock in the morning that there'd been this attack, of course, you phone. where are you? and his phone didn't answer. and we didn't know where - we knew he was travelling across london to a friend. but we didn't know where he was. and that panic that you feel when you think - could he? can't possibly be - you know what i mean?
and it turned out he was fine. he'd just gone to a friend's. and he was blissfully unaware and had his phone off. but we were the lucky ones. some people weren't lucky. and i remember when the shock of - i went to the office and said, i - i had thought about that i had wanted to address 9/11 in a film, but not really knowing quite how because it was the central event in our world. it was driving. it was clear - it was going to drive all our politics. everything was going to change. and, you know, i wanted to find a way of addressing it.
but that was the moment, truly, when i - because i remember i walked into the office and said, i'm going to make - i had thought about making what it finally became, which was really about - the air traffic control system is really what that film's about, which - 93 is one part of it. and it's really, ultimately, about the incredibly beautiful but highly vulnerable latticework that is a modern democracy and how easy it is to break it and what that looks and feels like, you know, what that's got to tell us. that was when i walked in and said, i'm going to make that film. and i did it. that must've been - that was july. and we were shooting it by october, november. i wrote it very quickly - in a couple of weeks, really.
greengrass: what kind of research did you have to do in order to write it?
greengrass: the first thing we did was go and see all the families and ask them what their feelings were. and they were very supportive - many, many different types of people with different opinions. why? you see it again and again, actually. i've seen it - i mean, all terrorist attacks, acts of political violence, are different, of course. but there are some common themes you see. one of the most common i have seen is that when these events happen, there is a deep desire on the part of those of us who survive, those of us who are bystanders, to want - after a necessary period of shock and mourning, we want to get on with our lives. we want normality to return.
but, of course, if you're caught up in these acts, your lives are forever changed. and you're propelled on journeys unimaginable and unwanted. why did this happen? what does it mean? we can't just go back to being normal now, you know? and they want to be heard. and i think, hopefully, when you make those - the film was made with great consultation and collaboration. i mean, i'm responsible for any of the failings of that film, you know? i'm not saying that. but you make it with them in an attempt to understand what it means. what does it mean as to what lessons can we draw from it? what does that have to say to this?
and, by the way, i felt very strongly that that was a process, by the way that, necessarily, always would happen. and you see it in, you know, newspapers and in television and in documentaries and in books. what does this mean? but i felt that cinema has to be part of that conversation, too. the question is, how do you do it with discretion with dignity and in the right way?
gross: my guest is director paul greengrass. his new film, news of the world, stars tom hanks. we'll talk more after a break. this is fresh air.
(soundbite of james newton howard's kidd visits maria)
gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with director paul greengrass. he started as a documentary filmmaker, shooting in wars and conflict zones. he's made several theatrical films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. his films include united 93 and captain phillips. his movie 22 july was based on the terrorist attack in norway by the far-right extremist anders breivik. greengrass also made three jason bourne movies. his new movie, news of the world, stars tom hanks. it's a western set five years after the civil war.
so you know, you talked about how you wanted to make a movie with a happy ending, which you don't typically do, but you did with your new movie, news of the world. so after making many movies that are reenactments of really tragic events, terrorist events, now you've made a movie where there's a lot of trouble. everyone is broken. but there is, by its standards, you know, a happy ending. what do you want to do next? do you want to pursue something else that ends with some happiness, with characters being better off than they were when they started?
greengrass: i honestly don't know. i enormously enjoyed making this film. it was a dream come true, actually, honestly and truly. you know, to make a western, you know, you stand out in the desert. you know, you can feel, when you look out in the distance, the ghost of papa ford out there somewhere. you know what i mean? and you know you're going to scramble inadequately upon the shoulders of the giant and try and take a shot at a western. you know, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. i don't know. i don't know what i'm going to do next. it'll pretty interesting to see. as i say, i'm already asking myself the question, you know, what is the question? and i think the question is, i heard somebody on television as that event was going on last week in d.c., say he was a very thoughtful person, some political commentator. he said the question is, is this the end of something or the beginning of something? and i thought, yep, that's absolutely right. that's going to be the question, i think, that will govern probably the next two or three years of our lives.
gross: on a lighter note, how did you like working with horses?
greengrass: (laughter) loved it. i used to ride a little bit when i was young, but not now. but tom was really good on a horse. he was fantastic. but it was - it was thrilling, just what i mean (ph). you know, you go out in the desert, and you see the horses and the wagons and, you know, the way people dressed. and you're in the west. and it's mythic, and it's part of your boyish imagination, you know?
and as i say, i loved it. i loved the experience of making it. it was physically demanding as a film. you know, it was a lot of heat and dust and freezing cold at night and climbing. i mean, that shootout when we had to climb up that bluff, it was - took two hours to get the crew up there. and you had to go up on ropes. and then there were rattlesnakes around the place, you know, and we had to have wranglers. you know, it was - but the adventure of it, i think, really brought people together. i think people loved that about it, you know?
gross: you know, just a sidebar note - i don't think i've ever seen tom hanks in a western before, except for toy story, (laughter) where it's not a western, but he is, you know - he is a toy wooden cowboy in it.
greengrass: well, he's the real deal in this. and i thought he sat well in that landscape. you know, he looked the part to me. and i love tom when he's weathered and...
gross: yes, his face is dirty most of the time.
greengrass: and has years and has experience behind his eyes - he's seen things; he's done things. it's a haunted quality to him, and it seems such an obvious thing to say. but i think we must take him for granted as a movie star because he is so consistently good in the things he does.
gross: i want to thank you so much for talking with us. and thank you for making news of the world, which i enjoyed so much. paul greengrass, it's really been a pleasure.
gross: paul greengrass directed the new film news of the world starring tom hanks. it's currently playing in theaters and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. we recorded our interview tuesday.
after we take a short break, ken tucker will review an hbo documentary about the bee gees and a new album by barry gibb, the only one of the three bee gee brothers still alive. this is fresh air.

daylight saving time is here again. so is the debate about changing the clocks
enlarge this image toggle caption charles krupa/ap charles krupa/ap
the dreaded spring ahead has finally arrived: on sunday, march 8, the clock will jump one hour forward at 2 a.m. to mark the official start of daylight saving time.
in general, the time change gets a bad rap. an ap-norc center for public affairs research poll conducted last fall found that 71% of respondents want to end the practice of changing the clocks. in all, 40% favored year-round standard time, while 31% said they'd prefer year-round daylight saving time.
some politicians have similarly come out against the semiannual time change, including sen. marco rubio (r-fla.), who has proposed a bill that would move the entire country to permanent, year-round daylight saving time.
according to the department of transportation, which oversees the observance of daylight saving time, the uniform time act of 1966 established the practice of switching clocks as we know it today. the dot says moving the clock forward by an hour saves energy by providing an extra hour of sunlight in the evening, thus reducing the need to use household electricity for lighting. the agency says that it also prevents traffic injuries because more people are commuting during the daylight and that it helps cut crime because more people are out conducting their affairs during the daylight rather than at night, when more crime occurs.
however, research on the effects of daylight saving time has also revealed drawbacks, and whether it truly helps conserve energy remains in question.
one 2009 study of miners, for example, found that in comparison with other days, on mondays directly following the start of daylight saving time, workers sustain more workplace injuries and injuries of greater severity due to tiredness.
another study, published in 2007 in the journal current biology, followed the sleep of 50 subjects for eight weeks across clock changes. it found that though human circadian rhythms — which control sleep patterns — generally adapt to the fall back change, they struggle to adjust to the spring ahead.
adhering to daylight saving time is a federal mandate, but states can opt out as long as they pass legislation and receive federal approval, according to the transportation department.
in fact, several states and territories have chosen to be exempt from daylight saving time, opting instead to follow standard time year-round. among them are arizona, hawaii, puerto rico, american samoa, guam and the virgin islands.
other states, like washington, have been in the fight to opt out of the time switch.
in may 2019, washington gov. jay inslee signed a bill that would #ditchtheswitch, putting the state on permanent daylight saving time. more than 30 states are considering similar legislation, according to the ap-norc center for public affairs research at the university of chicago.
however, washingtonians will still spring forward on sunday with the rest of the country, as the state waits on congress to approve the change, according to the seattle times.
meanwhile, #ditchtheswitch has gained traction on social media, prompting both voices of support and backlash. it's a debate that won't be going away anytime soon, and unless you're in an exempt area, expect to be groggy on monday.
after attack, an uproar over a call for french jews to quit wearing yarmulkes

a debate is raging in france over whether jewish men should avoid wearing the traditional yarmulke, so as not to identify themselves at a time of increasing violence by young radical islamists. the proposal was put forth this week by a jewish leader in marseille, following a knife attack on a local jewish teacher.
zvi ammar, head of marseille's 60,000-strong jewish community, suggested it might be better if jews in marseille stopped wearing the yarmulke, also known as a kippah.
for the time being, ammar said, at least until these barbarians calm down.
he was referring to a kurdish immigrant from turkey, a high school student, who attacked a jewish teacher with a butcher knife and claimed to be inspired by islamic state. the assault on monday in marseille horrified the country. but there's also been a strong reaction to ammar's proposal.

france's head rabbi, haim korsia, called it defeatist.
to suggest this is like saying jews bear some responsibility for being attacked, said korsia. this is the same kind of thinking as those who would say a woman is guilty of a sexual assault because her skirt wasn't long enough.
french officials on the left and right have denounced the proposal for jews to remove their yarmulkes. parliamentarian xavier bertrand spoke about it on a popular radio show.
if the jews of marseille don't wear their kippahs, france is no longer france, he said. because it will mean letting those who want to change our way of living and values win. we can't let that happen.
several of the recent terrorist attacks in france have specifically targeted jews. france, home to 600,000 jews, has europe's largest jewish population and the third largest in the world, after israel and the u.s. but in recent years, jews have been leaving the country. the daily newspaper le parisien reports that not since 1948, the year israel declared statehood, have so many jews left france. some have left for economic reasons; some out of fear.

national jewish community leader joel mergui says jews know that wearing the kippah could make them the target of young radicals. but we're not going to stop going to sporting events at stadiums or to concerts or cafes, he says. and so jews will continue to wear the kippah.
after last year's attacks on satirical newspaper charlie hebdo and a kosher supermarket, an israeli journalist secretly filmed himself walking through some of paris' rougher immigrant and muslim neighborhoods while wearing a kippah. broadcast on french tv, the clip shows him drawing some unsavory comments. one group of young men wearing hoodies can be heard comparing him to a dog.
french interior minister bernard cazeneuve is in marseille, visiting the teacher who was attacked — said to be psychologically shaken but physically fine. cazeneuve is also there to reassure the city's jewish community.
bertrand, the parliamentarian, said it is the french state's job to protect its citizens — and it would protect french jews.
ten thousand french soldiers are serving across the country, providing security along with police. nowhere is their presence more visible than in the marais, paris' traditional jewish quarter, where soldiers with assault rifles patrol the streets and stand guard outside the synagogues.

clothing shop owner stephan levy says he feels safe, but things have changed in the past couple of years.
now i think it's less risky sometimes to wear a baseball cap or a hat rather than a kippah, depending where you're going, he says. and not just in france, in other countries too. because, let's face it — these days, jews are targeted.
teacher avraham scharbit is wearing his kippah. so is his 4-year-old son, who is buckled into a seat on the back of his father's bike.
yeah, i sometimes wear a baseball cap instead of my kippah, scharbit says. the important thing is to keep your head covered. i do both. but it's not a big deal.
scharbit says he's not afraid — and says france is a good place to raise his children.
former michigan gov. rick snyder charged in flint water crisis
enlarge this image toggle caption carlos osorio/ap carlos osorio/ap
former michigan gov. rick snyder was charged wednesday for his role in the flint water crisis, an environmental disaster that contaminated the majority black city's drinking water with lead nearly seven years ago.
snyder is facing two counts of willful neglect of duty and if convicted he could face up to a year in prison and as much as a $1,000 fine.
other former members of his administration are expected to face charges as well, according to the associated press.
earlier this week, as reports began to surface that charges were looming, an attorney for snyder referred to them as a politically motivated smear campaign, according to the detroit free press.
snyder, a republican, was michigan's top executive when state-appointed officials decided to switch the city's drinking water source from detroit's water system to the flint river in 2014.
it stems from a decision billed as a way to save money and only supposed to be a temporary fix while officials built a pipeline to nearby lake huron. but it turned out to be costly, both in lives lost and in a settlement worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
last year nessel announced a $600 million-dollar settlement for flint families impacted by the water crisis last year.
the deal puts the needs of children first, she said during the august announcement.
young people were especially vulnerable, at risk of suffering long-term cognitive challenges and other health issues from being exposed to lead contamination in the water.
as npr's bill chappell reported at the time the settlement indicated that nearly 80% of the funds were earmarked to resolved claims filed on behalf of children and minors.
the remaining portion of the settlement is expected to be divvied up among other flint residents who fell ill from the contaminated water or suffered property damage, michigan public radio reports.
but a u.s. district court judge is expected to soon rule on whether to give the settlement preliminary approval, mpr reports.
at least 12 died, more than 80 became sick
the station adds not everyone is happy with the settlement. that includes john mcclain, a pastor, who characterized the proposed settlement as disrespectful, because he said there are too many roadblocks for residents to access the money and it doesn't provide enough to cover damages.
we believe the proposed settlement as currently allocated is just as disrespectful as the injury caused by the water crisis tragedy itself, mcclain told mpr.
at least dozen people died and more than 80 people were sickened with legionnaires' disease after water from the flint river caused lead to leach from old pipes, poisoning the water system city.
soon after the switch, residents began to complain that the new water in their homes had a foul stench, tasted different and was discolored, according to an mlive report from may 2014, a month after the change in water sources.
officials with the michigan department of environmental quality told flint city officials they did not need to use any corrosion control measures to treat the river water, at least not initially, michigan public radio reported in december 2016.
the wait-and-see approach was a really bad idea, experts told mpr, because without the necessary treatment the protective coating on the inside of the pipes that built up over the years from detroit's water likely disappeared. and that's what caused lead levels to spike in many homes in flint.

snyder, who has been out of office for two years, apologized for his role in the environmental debacle during his 2016 state of the state address.
your families face a crisis, a crisis which you did not create and could not have prevented, snyder said. i want to speak directly, honestly and sincerely to let you know we are praying for you. we are working hard for you and we are absolutely committed to taking the right steps to effectively solve this crisis. to you, the people of flint, i say ... i'm sorry and i will fix it.
more than a dozen state and city officials were indicted for their roles in the crisis. several of them accepted plea deals to avoid prison time.
in june of 2019 nessel announced that state prosecutors were dropping all criminal charges against a group of eight government officials, and moved to launch a more expansive investigation.
i want to remind the people of flint that justice delayed is not always justice denied and a fearless and dedicated team of career prosecutors and investigators are hard at work to ensure those who harmed you are held accountable, nessel said in a statement at the time.
npr's dylan scott contributed to this report.
remembering peabody award-winning radio artist joe frank
frank, who died on monday, created the radio drama series work in progress and was known for his intimate on-air monologues, sketches and interviews. originally broadcast in 1989.
this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross, who's off this week. many years ago, when fresh air was a three-hour local show with plenty of time to fill, terry was always happy when some new material was available from joe frank, a masterful storyteller whose syndicated radio show work in progress was a one-of-a-kind production that defies easy description. frank died monday in beverly hills at the age of 79. frank's shows combined interviews, personal monologues, dramas with radio actors - even tapes frank had surreptitiously recorded of friends, family and strangers.
ira glass worked as a production assistant for frank in the early '80s, and he credits frank as a major influence on his program this american life. terry spoke to joe frank in 1989, and they began with an episode of his program called rent-a-family, in which a woman named eleanor phones her ex-husband arthur, who's remarried. it's one of a series of desperate calls she's made, and arthur's begged her to stop calling.
unidentified actress #1: (as kathy) hello.
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) hello. may i speak to arthur, please?
unidentified actress #1: (as kathy) eleanor - eleanor, this has got to stop. i mean, this can't go on. surely, you're aware of that.
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) may i speak to arthur, please?
unidentified actress #1: (as kathy) eleanor, listen. i understand what you are going through, but what you've got know is that it's not working. none of what you are doing is working.
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) may i speak to arthur, please.
unidentified actress #1: (as kathy) ok.
unidentified actor: (as arthur) what is it?
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) arthur, i've been thinking.
unidentified actor: (as arthur) yeah, what?
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) i would like to come and visit with you and kathy (ph) for a while. now hear me out. i won't be any trouble. i can do all the things i'm sure kathy has no time to do because she has her job. and i can cook nice things for you both. and i can clean the house. and i can do the gardening. and i can take care of all of the little things that you don't have time to do or that you don't like to do - you know, arthur, those things. and i'll stay - i'll stay out of your way. i won't say a word if i'm not - i'll be sort of a housekeeper - a silent housekeeper. you see the thing is that i need - i need a family, arthur.
unidentified actor: (as arthur) eleanor, i feel for you. kathy feels for you. but you got to understand we have our own life. it won't work. how could you possibly imagine that the three of us could share a house together?
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) but you don't understand. i could do all kinds of things for you. i could clean the house. i could keep the garden beautiful. and your life would be so much easier. don't you understand? it would be...
unidentified actor: (as arthur) what you're suggesting is bizarre.
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) why?
unidentified actor: (as arthur) it's absurd.
unidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) it could work. it could. it could.
terry gross, byline: an excerpt of rent-a-family, written and directed by my guest joe frank from his series work in progress, which is produced at public radio station kcrw in santa monica and is carried on many public radio stations around the country.
joe frank, what's really eerie about that tape is how real it sounds. i'm usually not a really big - real big fan of radio drama. there's something about it that sounds very phony and actorly (ph) a lot of the time. and these sound like real phone conversations - real scary ones.
joe frank: well, i agree with you entirely about radio drama. and i've never been able to listen to radio drama and believe in the credibility of the performances. and i'm always distanced from it, and it does seem artificial to me. and so the approach that i've taken in all the dramas that i've created is that in fact they're not written. it's not accurate to say it was written by joe frank because these are improvisations performed by actors, which are very carefully directed. and what this involves is a great deal of editing because you do a lot of - you create a lot of tape. you create a lot of - you do the telephone calls over and over again. and then i edit them in such a way that i hope creates a credible performance.
gross: well, sometimes you do tell your own story. and i want to play an excerpt of a show in which you did that - at least i assume it was your story. and the show is called no show. and do you want to explain what this show is about?
frank: well, no show came out of an experience in which i was - i came into the radio station unprepared to do a radio show. i had had a horrendous week. everything seemed to had gone wrong that week. i'd had no chance to write or to work on creating a radio program. and so i decided since i had to go on the air, and there was no way of avoiding it, that i would simply explain to my listening audience why i had no show prepared.
gross: and one of the many reasons why you had no show, in addition to having been out with a friend till 4 in the morning, having a sick cat, having a lonely friend come over - (laughter) in spite of your asking her not to - you were invited to a dinner party. and you had to go. and this is the part of your program no show in which you talked about that dinner party, which prevented you from producing your program that week.
(soundbite of radio show, no show)
frank: well, the dinner party that i attended began with a group of people sitting and talking in the parlor living room of a woman's house - of the hostess who had invited us all - eating caviar and sour cream, liverwurst spread and cheese on crackers. and there was a table with a row of wine bottles and some glasses on it. i was compulsively eating the crackers and the cheeses and drinking wine - wishing that i could wake up from this dream, be back alone in my hotel room. but i was also thinking, this is good for you. this is good for you. get out. meet people. you could learn something. this will be nourishing. maybe you can get some good material out of it.
but, you know, it's hard to be a gatherer of material when you find yourself periodically tuning out to what's going on, when you lose track of the conversation, when you suddenly find yourself on dream street. you don't have the faintest notion of what anybody is saying - of what's being discussed. you're thousands of miles away. it's like the other people there are on television. they're characters in a sitcom with the volume turned off. and you can see them gesturing and talking and laughing, but you can't hear anything. and you're thinking of nothing. your mind is in brownout.
and yet i was painfully aware of the fact that to some extent i was on trial. the party was being given - i was told, to my chagrin - in my honor. and everyone else here, i figured, was - were members of the jury. you know, they were all being very nice, and they were being pleasant. but i knew that at the end of the evening when they were walking and driving home with their friends, with their lovers, with their wives, they would discuss how the evening went.
and my name eventually would come up at some point. and they'd say something like he seemed so intelligent, so outgoing on the air. but really he's rather disappointing, don't you think? george was so much funnier. george was so much cleverer. he was so much faster on his feet than joe frank was. i mean, did the man say one arresting thing all evening? no, he just sat there listening, laughing at what other people said - trying to avoid the limelight for all he was worth. he's obviously typical of so many performers - shy, neurotically withdrawn.
gross: joe frank - an excerpt of his program work in progress, which is heard on many public radio stations around the country. joe, do you really make pacts with yourself to never go out again (laughter)?
frank: well, i don't go out, or i very rarely go out. and i certainly haven't been to a dinner party since the one that i described.
frank: and that was at least a year ago. yes, i remember that party well. and i'm pretty much a loner and pretty much work-obsessed and spent most of my time working or thinking about the work that i'm doing.
gross: well, let me ask you about the work obsession. you have to eliminate a lot of, quote, real life to stay home all the time and obsess on your work. do you think that that kind of real life is sometimes overrated as it's filled with stuff that you don't much enjoy anyways?
frank: no. i think i've been caught in a paradox, really, because in order to be able to create compelling radio programs, you have to have some experiences to base, you know, those programs on. and if you live the kind of life that i've been living recently, you're not living yourself. you're just - you're not gathering material from your own life.
so what i have done recently, although i'm going to change that very soon, is i have drawn on the experiences of others. i interview people. i talk to people. people come to me with their stories. and we'll sit late at night for hours in my apartment with a tape recorder rolling. and then on the basis of that extended interview - and some of these interviews will go on for days - radio programs will be created.
but i'm beginning to find this approach too parasitic and not that personally satisfying. so i'm going to go out and begin to live as a normal human being or maybe an abnormal human being in order to gather my own material and sort of create experiences for my radio program out of my own life as opposed to drawing from other people's lives.
gross: you know, a lot of your more personal shows deal with fears and insecurities - ones that, you know, we can all relate to. but i wonder if when you take your own insecurities and put them in a kind of persona and make them into an hour radio program, if they're easier to deal with than they are, say, when you're lying awake alone in the middle of the night.
frank: oh, yeah. as a matter of fact, by using those experiences for radio programs, you transcend them. you almost look for bad experiences or painful experiences. whatever tragedies might befall you, you can always, right away, think, well, that would make a great story for radio. and so that whatever happens, even if it has a great negative content, even if it's painful - because you can then tell it on the radio and share it with many listeners and move people or entertain people, it then takes on a positive value.
and i remember distinctly that - coming to that revelation a number of years ago when i realized that i no longer wanted to avoid pain - that i could use it in a way that was very productive so that it was easier to experience whatever suffering that came my way.
davies: radio artist joe frank speaking with terry gross, recorded in 1989. we'll hear more after a break. this is fresh air.
davies: this is fresh air. we're listening to terry's 1989 interview with radio artist joe frank. frank died monday at the age of 79.
gross: i want to play another excerpt from one of your shows. and this is from a program that you did called let me not dream. and for this show, you called a lot of your ex-lovers. and explain what this was about.
frank: i'm constantly driven by the desire to do something that has never been done before on the radio or to surprise and astonish and amaze my listeners or just to kind of press the limits as far as i can carry them or press them. one thing that had occurred to me was to call up all my former lovers and girlfriends.
it was 11 o'clock in los angeles. and all - they were all living on the east coast because that's where i was originally from. so they - it was late at night in new york and washington, d.c., which was where they all lived. and i called one after another after another after another and woke most of them up and just told them that i was calling them live on the air and engaged them in conversation. and at the end of each conversation, i sang the song i remember you.
gross: let's hear an excerpt of this program.
(soundbite of radio show, let me not dream)
frank: hi. how are you doing?
frank: your time - it's probably 2:30 now. do you know what i'm doing?
amy: you just finished your show?
frank: no, my show is still on.
frank: do you know what that means?
amy: am i on the air?
frank: that's right. you're on the air now.
amy: oh, well, glad i'm so sleepy.
frank: that's all right. i just want to sing you a song.
frank: yeah. you can sing with me if you want to.
frank: you ready? here we go.
(soundbite of vinson hill and rich mattheson quartets' i remember you)
frank: (singing) i remember you. you're the one who made my dreams come true a few kisses ago.
you can sing along if you want to. (singing) i remember you. you're the one who said i love you, too. i do. didn't you know...
i remember, too, what distant bells... (singing) i remember, too, what distant bells...
and stars that fell... (singing) and stars that fell...
like rain out of the blue... (singing) like rain out of the blue...
frank: (singing) when my life is through, and the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all, then i shall tell them i remember you.
i'm going to go away now.
amy: was that just for me?
frank: that was just for you.
gross: well, joe frank, i think that was really funny and really cruel (laughter). it's one of the weirdest pieces of tape i've heard. don't you think it's a little cruel - calling up - wait. let me just run through the ways (laughter) - calling up old girlfriends, waking them up because it's 2:30 their time, singing a song they don't know and asking them to sing along and then telling them - leading them to believe that they're the only one that you've called to sing i remember you to (laughter).
frank: i feel guilty about that program. on that...
frank: you know, very often, when you do what i do, you...
gross: sell out a friend for a program (laughter).
frank: that's - well, i must say that she was the only one who asked me, did you just do this for me? so i only had to lie once. and the - it's true. it was - there was cruelty in doing that. and i sometimes question myself about that particular program. in fact, let me not dream - i could have repeated it recently on kcrw at a certain point. and i didn't want to do it because i feel uncomfortable with that show. however, on the other hand, it's a program that generated tremendous listener response. people loved it. and i got lots of letters and phone calls and people who wanted cassette copies of the show because they thought it was so amusing and entertaining and original. so you're kind of torn between doing things that may not be very nice sometimes but make really extraordinary radio.
gross: you are getting into performing in person now - i mean performing in performance spaces, instead of just on the radio, where you're invisible. and i wonder what it's been like for you to actually, you know, have a body in front of the people who you're talking to. i found myself - that i frequently feel when i meet listeners - that i'm disappointing them, you know, that they've imagined somebody in their mind and that there you are, the real person, and that you're not necessarily going to measure up to who they imagined you were, you know? do you ever feel that way?
frank: oh, absolutely. but i feel that way when listeners come by the radio station - those avid, slavering, salivating fans with their eyes brightly shining. and they're looking for you. and then suddenly, they see you. and they - and you can see their expressions drop, and their hair seems to lose its luster.
frank: and they seem suddenly deeply saddened by seeing you. but the performance that i've been doing at moca, the museum of contemporary art in los angeles, is a different experience altogether because in that case, i'm actually in front of an audience of just about 200. and in that case, i don't feel that particular experience because i do a performance which is similar to the radio programs that i present. and the audience seems to enjoy it. but it's not how attractive you are. it's simply that people have a preconceived notion somehow of what you look like based on this voice that they've been listening to maybe for years. and whatever you look like, it's not going to be what they they've imagined.
davies: radio artist joe frank speaking with terry gross - recorded in 1989. frank died monday. he was 79. coming up, we speak with daniel ellsberg, whose decision to leak the top-secret study of the vietnam war known as the pentagon papers is portrayed in the new film the post. i'm dave davies, and this is fresh air.

newark police camera system relies on residents, stirring privacy concerns
enlarge this image toggle caption marco jeurissen/getty images marco jeurissen/getty images
newark, new jersey's largest city, is taking the concept of a neighborhood watch to a whole new level.
the city is installing hundreds of surveillance cameras to create a virtual block watch.
some residents are concerned about the technology's implications for people's privacy.
mayor ras baraka says the new cameras replace the old system that was wiped out during hurricane sandy. he says these cameras are different: these cameras are going to be watched, and, baraka hopes, not only by the newark police department. we're also recruiting our neighborhood and our residents to participate and engage with us, he says.
but that engagement goes well beyond the residents.
newark's virtual patrol, as the system is called, allows anyone with an email address and internet connection to watch whatever activities the cameras capture — cars driving through intersections, a young woman leaving a corner store, children hanging out on a street.
sixty-two cameras are already in operation. by january, there will be 300 cameras — that anyone, anywhere can watch — like adam schwartz. he's a senior lawyer at the electronic frontier foundation, a civil liberties nonprofit in california.
to access the surveillance system on the newark police department website, schwartz simply creates an account and signs in. then, within seconds, he sees a map locating the blue cameras. so i can click on one of these cameras and see what's going on, he says.
such easy access to the cameras could have a chilling effect on civil liberties, schwartz says. there are people who — if they are invited to go to a demonstration and they see one of these blue cameras is up — they might decide they don't want to show up.
the new technology could put black and brown people at risk for being targeted. it's lower-income and minority communities where these technologies are deployed and they lead to more arrests, schwartz says.
that's a concern for newarkers like linda carter and josie gonsalves. on the block where raymond boulevard intersects broad street, one of the 62 blocks being monitored by a surveillance camera, carter and gonsalves are gathered in front of a tax office.
as the camera pans back and forth, they watch the video play in real time on my iphone via the newark police department website.
those white things — those are the cameras, carter says. i can see you. that's us ... there we are. there's my red coat.
after the initial thrill of spotting themselves on the phone screen, carter expresses dread. i'm very, very concerned, she says. people are collecting information on us — who are they sharing it with and what is our power in the situation?
it's like we're taking our power away as citizens, she continues, because we don't get to opt out, and everybody else can use it for whatever reason, whether it's good or bad.
gonsalves says the technology changes how newarkers like her will carry themselves in public. we as citizens, the whole way in which we interact with each other, we're watching ourselves, watching our neighbors — and everyone becomes a suspect, she says.
not everyone finds the cameras bewildering. some residents say violent crimes like murder are still common, and the cameras add a layer of protection.
this is taking 'see something, say something' to a whole 'nother level, says steve surfaro, who visits newark often for work. surfaro is an official with the security industry association, a trade group that represents companies that build security and surveillance systems.
after taking a look at the newark police cameras, surfaro says he doesn't think the video resolution is clear enough to cause concern. what you're able to do is to see people. you're able to see vehicles. you can see weather, he says. but you can't really see license plates. you can't really recognize faces.
he says the cameras can capture activities where the public can help, like identifying fire, or a crowd gathered around someone in distress. one down side, though, is that the public could misread what they're seeing — like mistaking someone handing off a book to someone else as a drug deal.
mayor baraka says newark is installing signs to let the public and the criminals know they're being watched. and he says that's not so unusual these days, when cameras are in stores and on people's homes.
what we're trying to do, is really compile and organize all of this to give us an opportunity to stay ahead of some the violence and crime in the city, baraka says.
so far, the city says more than 1,600 people have registered on the police department's website. that's 1,600 more sets of eyes watching the streets of newark.
lego says it is changing its policy after ai weiwei controversy
a photo of ai weiwei covered in lego bricks was posted to his instagram account. 😄 a photo posted by ai weiwei (@aiww) on jan 12, 2016 at 10:42pm pst
lego says it is changing its guidelines for the purchase of large amounts of its iconic toy bricks, a policy that had generated a social media firestorm when used to block sales to chinese artist ai weiwei.
the company said in a statement that it will no longer ask people who want to buy the bricks in bulk what they're using them for:
instead, the customers will be asked to make it clear — if they intend to display their lego creations in public — that the lego group does not support or endorse the specific projects.
in october, ai said lego had refused to sell him the bricks he needed for an exhibition on free speech at australia's national gallery of victoria. he intended to use the bricks to create portraits of freedom advocates.
a frequent critic of china who was imprisoned by the government, ai accused the danish company of censorship and said it was afraid to offend beijing.
after the company's decision, supporters of ai set up donation points around the world for people to donate used bricks. ai also told npr that he was flooded with messages of support on social media:
they're not necessarily museumgoers, but they understand what is the most important meaning of art, which is to really express yourself successfully and to really defend the essential values.
ai said pressure from his supporters had pressured lego to change its policy on bulk orders, and he told the associated press that it was a good move:

scientists and doctors say the case is clear: the best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.
yet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the u.s. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.
one reason is the limited availability of the treatment. but it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.
methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. a phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. while doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.
now, the white house is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. in his 2017 budget, president obama has asked congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.
the white house is also highlighting success stories. at the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit held in atlanta in march, obama appeared on stage with crystal oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from ohio. oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. she tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. i personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, oertle said in atlanta. i couldn't tough it out. i know some people can. i couldn't do it. this last time has been the most successful recovery for me.
i've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says michael botticelli, director of national drug control policy at the white house. we wouldn't do that with any other disease. if one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.

botticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.
methadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.
we have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says dr. marc fishman, medical director at maryland treatment centers in baltimore. he says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.

still, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.
for years, juan ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. when you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.
a friend told ramirez about a doctor in baltimore who prescribed suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. he liked the way suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. he stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. i was still an addict, he says. it was just legal.

that line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including david lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in hagerstown, md. the home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. in addition to beds, lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. the emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. it's what worked for lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.
when he started his work as a recovery advocate, lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting suboxone. that to me just looks like heroin, lidz says.
so he made a decision: he wouldn't accept anyone on it.
today, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on suboxone, lidz says.
he worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like charles testerman, who came to lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. he drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. when he couldn't afford heroin, he bought suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. it didn't work.
i was doing suboxone in the mornings, as well as adderall to bring myself up. then at night, i was taking xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, testerman says. it was just a constant cycle.

today, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called the stoner farm, anglicized from steiner, the name of the family who built the place. testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. i feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. it's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.

fishman, the addiction doctor in baltimore, knows there are people like testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. but, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. he wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.
this doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. but we don't have the penicillin for addiction. these are not curative medications. in having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations i think would make us more credible.
coronavirus: all 50 states report cases; south america has nearly 1,000 cases

west virginia is no longer coronavirus-free.
it was the final state without any reports of infection by the highly contagious coronavirus, but on tuesday evening gov. jim justice announced officials have confirmed the state's first case.
we knew it was coming, justice said at a news conference.
we've prepared for this and we shouldn't panic. we should be cautious. we should be concerned, but we shouldn't panic. we ought to be west virginia mountaineer strong always, he added.
earlier in the day, president trump praised justice for his handling of the spread of the virus, by treating it differently than a new york or california. calling him big jim, trump said justice must be doing a good job of that. ... west virginia is the only one that has no cases.
later justice, who is a vocal supporter of trump, attempted to assuage worries that the discovery of a case in the state will disrupt daily life as well as the economy.
our nation and our state is going to have to step up and keep you whole as best we possibly can. i can assure you that my real friend donald trump is absolutely all on board with trying to do just that, justice said.
the governor ordered the closure of bars and restaurants, while still allowing carry-out and drive-through service to continue. he also mandated the closure of the state's casinos.
he had previously ordered the closure of all public and private schools, effective monday, as well as, canceling the state's high school basketball playoffs.
oklahoma's senate put on lockdown for coronavirus testing
members of oklahoma's state senate were put on lockdown in their offices tuesday, after the state health department said an employee at the capitol building tested positive for the coronavirus that causes covid-19.
in an email, state senators were asked to remain in their offices until they could be tested, rachel hubbard of member station kosu reports from oklahoma city. that email came one hour after oklahoma health officials issued an update saying that the number of tests for the public remains limited to the point of rationing and that health care providers are being asked to test for other illnesses such as the flu before requesting a covid-19 test. these tests are being coordinated with a private lab.
an email sent to senators and staff asked them to remain in their offices and await a visit from a health professional, kosu reports.
hubbard adds, on monday, oklahoma lawmakers passed rules that would allow them to suspend the legislative session until further notice, but the following morning, the parking lot was full of cars.
a shortage of testing kits is the reason the effort at the senate requires a private lab, the oklahoma department of health says. the agency says it has about 350 covid-19 test kits on hand. the state senate has 48 members.
the federal government is advising us it could be 48 hours before test kits can be deployed to restock, the health department said via twitter.
the state senate's offices will be closed for the rest of the week and employees will telework, senate president pro tempore greg treat said tuesday afternoon.
as of today, 152 countries across the globe are affected by this new virus and over 7,000 people have lost their lives to it, the world health organization's regional director for europe said tuesday, describing the reach of a coronavirus that is disrupting lives in countries around the world.
one-third of globally reported cases are in the european region, the who's dr. hans henri p. kluge said, reiterating his agency's recent acknowledgement that the covid-19 pandemic's epicenter lies not in china, where this coronavirus was discovered in december, but in europe.
the lives of millions of people in our region are undergoing radical change. there is quite simply a new reality, kluge said in a briefing that was held in a u.n. building that has been nearly completely abandoned as workers stay home to practice social distancing. as kluge spoke, a large bottle of hand sanitizer sat on the table in front of him.
the u.s. has more than 5,600 cases of the respiratory virus, as of midday tuesday, and 94 people have died. new york is reporting some 1,700 cases, and washington state is reporting nearly 1,000.
south america has nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases
brazil, peru and chile are all reporting hundreds of coronavirus cases, as south american governments tighten restrictions on public life to slow down the spread of the deadly covid-19 respiratory disease. the continent now has more than 940 cases.
in venezuela, president nicolás maduro has announced a nationwide quarantine amid deep concern about the havoc the coronavirus could cause in a nation where the health system's collapsed and there's a massive shortage of doctors, equipment and medicine, npr's philip reeves reports from rio de janeiro for npr's newscast unit.
colombia and argentina have closed their borders to arriving foreigners; chile follows suit tomorrow (wednesday). ecuador and paraguay have nighttime curfews, reeves says, and in brazil, firemen using megaphones are patrolling beaches in rio de janeiro, asking people to go home. tourists must cancel plans to visit rio's sugarloaf mountain and the statue of christ the redeemer — like so much else here, they're now closed.
here are the countries in south america reporting the most coronavirus cases as of 4 p.m. et tuesday, according to a dashboard created by the johns hopkins whiting school of engineering:
italy: rate of new cases slows, even as death toll rises
more than 2,500 people have died of covid-19 in italy, the heart of the outbreak in europe, the country's health ministry announced tuesday afternoon. italy is now reporting 31,506 total cases, including nearly 13,000 people who are hospitalized.
despite the huge numbers of infected people, italy's 24-hour rise of 3,500 new cases is the slowest rate of increase the country has seen in weeks.
one week after the government put the country in lockdown, health officials stress that they do not expect to see a substantial decline in the number of positive cases until the end of next week, npr's sylvia poggioli reports from rome. after consultations with unions and business leaders, the government has announced a large economic aid package dubbed 'heal italy' to help families, workers and industries. it includes suspended tax payments, workers' compensation and export credits.
poggioli adds that the lombardy region, which is the epicenter of italy's coronavirus cases, has just received a large shipment of medical gear, including respirators and protective clothing, from china.

uber and lyft cancel shared rides
uber and lyft will no longer offer users the option of sharing or pooling rides, as the companies try to limit customers' potential exposure to the coronavirus.
both of the ride-hailing companies announced the temporary change on tuesday.
the health and safety of the lyft community is our top priority, and we're dedicated to doing what we can to slow the spread of covid-19, lyft said via twitter.
lyft is halting the use of shared rides across all markets. uber is suspending its pool option in the u.s. and canada, as well as in london and paris.
uber and lyft let passengers carpool, in exchange for cheaper fares, npr's shannon bond reports from san francisco. these features are being put on hold as cities tell people to avoid nonessential travel and stay at least 6 feet away from each other. the companies are still operating their regular ride services, and ubereats is still offering food delivery.
bus drivers in detroit refuse to work, citing lack of protections
bus service was canceled in detroit on tuesday, after many drivers refused to work out of concern for the coronavirus. their complaints range from the capacity of buses to carry far more than the 10 people federal health experts currently recommend as a maximum for public gatherings to insufficient cleaning and sanitizing measures.
due to the driver shortage, there will be no ddot bus service today, the detroit department of transportation announced.
the city says it's working to address the drivers' concerns.
detroit mayor mike duggan says that in addition to worries directly related to the covid-19 pandemic, the drivers are also coping with the loss of many of their restroom break sites. because of new restrictions at hospitals and restaurants, drivers who relied on those facilities at the end of their routes found themselves unable to wash up and use restrooms as they came back, duggan said, according to local tv station click on detroit.
michigan has reported 58 coronavirus cases, as of midday tuesday et.
hospital in massachusetts will be dedicated to treating covid-19 patients
the carney hospital in dorchester, mass., is being remade into what is believed to be the first u.s. hospital devoted entirely to caring for covid-19 patients, in a process that will begin on tuesday.
the 135-bed hospital on dorchester avenue will be converted immediately to enhance 'patient isolation protocols' and to marshal equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment on site, member station wbur reports.
steward health care, which operates carney hospital, says the changes will also include the creation of negative pressure patient wards.
steward, which is based in dallas, operates 35 hospitals in nine states and serves more than six million patients annually, according to its website.
the company says its all-covid-19 conversion has two main goals: to establish a model for care that's dedicated to fighting the pandemic and to free up other medical facilities, including emergency rooms, to help people with other urgent conditions. steward also says it's working to set up more drive-through testing sites.
while we have only treated 10 confirmed covid-19 inpatients across our more than 7,000 beds nationwide to date, we are prepared for an influx, the company says.
all but 1 u.s. states have reported a coronavirus case
as of late monday, west virginia was the only state that has not reported a coronavirus case. but the state was also among the last to gain the ability to test for the virus that causes covid-19 — reflecting a wider problem in the u.s., where the rollout of a national testing system has been slowed by critical problems at the federal level.
west virginia's public health lab has tested 84 residents for covid-19, with 80 results coming back negative and four tests pending, the state department of health and human resources said monday afternoon.
like many other states, west virginia's public lab is now being bolstered by the testing efforts of commercial laboratories and some hospitals.
the union of european football associations is postponing its biggest tournament, euro 2020, for 12 months because of the covid-19 pandemic. the competition, which pits national teams against one another, was to have been played in june and july.
uefa has 55 member countries. in announcing the decision to put off the euro tourney, it said the decision to put off the popular tournament was made not only out of concern for the safety of fans of players, but also to avoid the strain its matches would put on public services and infrastructure. in recent days, europe has emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic, with tens of thousands of new cases in the past week.
we are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent, uefa president aleksander čeferin said. it is at times like these that the football community needs to show responsibility, unity, solidarity and altruism.
under the plan, uefa playoffs and international friendly matches that had been scheduled for the end of this month will now be played in early june, the league says, although it acknowledged that the dates are subject to further scrutiny.
the kentucky derby had been scheduled to be run on may 2 – but the crown jewel of horse racing's triple crown will instead be postponed until september, the churchill downs racetrack announced tuesday.
the race traditionally takes place on the first saturday of may; this year, it'll happen on sept. 5.
people who have already bought tickets for the race will automatically have those tickets transferred to the september date; anyone who's unable to attend can seek a refund online, the racetrack said in a statement posted on its website.
churchill downs attracts more than 150,000 spectators for the race. but new federal guidelines recommend limiting public gatherings to a much smaller size – on monday, the trump administration advised americans to avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more.
nevada reaches major milestone as first state with majority of women in legislature
it's the year of women in nevada. on monday, the state becomes the first to have a legislature where women outnumber men. the state's supreme court also has a majority of women.
in carson city tomorrow, nevada's legislature is meeting. and in a first for the united states, women will outnumber men. npr's leila fadel reports.
leila fadel, byline: at nevada governor steve sisolak' state of the state speech, he hailed the new legislature.
steve sisolak: tonight we are joined by the newly elected and appointed women who took a leap this past year and, together, made history.
fadel: like the country, it's just over 50 percent women. and patricia ann spearman, a nevada senator and democrat, says, finally.
patricia ann spearman: i'm starting to see some of the fruits of not just my labor but the labor of so many other people whose names i don't know. but the fruits of their labor are present and undeniable.
fadel: spearman is 64, a black woman, a lesbian, a retired lieutenant colonel in the army and an ordained minister.
spearman: i've had to fight for everything that i have. all the titles - none of that was given to me.
fadel: she was first elected as state senator in 2012.
spearman: i think what has happened in nevada is women, in particular - and we have had some men to support this - have said, it's time to do away with the patriarchy that holds people down. it's just time to do away with that.
fadel: nevada has been leading when it comes to electing women. they are now the majority in the state supreme court. the lieutenant governor is a woman. on the federal level, both u.s. senators are women. and half of the state's u.s. representatives are women. nevada isn't the rule, though. kelly dittmar is a scholar at the center for american women and politics at rutgers university.
kelly dittmar: getting to 50 percent in any one place is something significant. at the same point, this is one legislature out of 50. so we still have a lot of progress left to make across the country.
fadel: but why has it taken this long to get here? dittmar says, of course, there was the formal exclusion of women from politics. women couldn't run or vote. since then, there's been the informal exclusion based on gender stereotypes, like women can't lead. also, men have just been doing this a lot longer.
dittmar: men in party leadership, political leadership, those are the people who are tapping candidates - right? - who are recruiting candidates to run and deciding who gets on the ballot.
fadel: and while nevada's milestone is remarkable, progress around the country has been slow. right now less than 30 percent of state legislators across the u.s. are women. less than 25 percent of congress is female. and the data show the only way to reach gender parity is to nominate more women. the democrats are doing that. about 70 percent of women state legislators are democrats. and overall, republican women lost seats in the last election. and that's because far fewer women were nominated from that party. jill tolles, a republican nevada assembly member, says she's working within her party to make sure there's recruiting and mentorship.
jill tolles: before i ran for office, i did look at the makeup and think, wow. there's just not as many females in the republican party. and how do we change that?
fadel: tolles says women in particular are reaching across the aisle in nevada with a bipartisan, bicameral women's caucus.
tolles: we were able to come together over the areas where we share common ground and be able to advance some access to women's health care, like breast cancer screenings and access to birth control.
fadel: this milestone, she says, is a continuation of that work. both assemblywoman tolles and senator spearman are headed back to carson city. but selena torres is serving for the first time. she's 23 and a high school english teacher.
selena torres: it's really exciting to be a part of this female majority but also to be a latina sitting in that majority. i mean, when you have students that are recognizing, maybe for the first time, that they too have the ability to be involved and run for office - and it truly highlights the importance of having us in office.
fadel: she's only a few years older than her students in a largely latino district in southern nevada. over a quarter of the state is latino. torres says nevada has always been a pioneering state with women trailblazers.
torres: when you think about nevada, we think about the wild west. and i think in a lot of ways, nevada still is the wild west.
fadel: she says this place isn't afraid to do things that others haven't. leila fadel, npr news, las vegas.

'you couldn't get elected dogcatcher!' no, seriously

a couple of weeks ago, npr's weekend edition told you about america's only elected dogcatcher, zeb towne. he's held that position in the town of duxbury, vt. for 15 years in a row.
towne told us he had never been bothered by that timeworn political insult: you couldn't get elected dogcatcher!
the story really hit home for me, because i cover politics, and i love dogs, so i've put a lot of thought into how you would run a campaign to be elected dogcatcher.
in fact, i've always thought that of all the elected positions out there, dogcatcher was the one i was best-suited to run for. my campaign platform would center around my proven track record of catching multiple neighborhood dogs.
campaign brochures would feature otis, a stray who showed up in my neighborhood a few years ago in sacramento. he was a small, dirty schnauzer-esque mutt who took up residence in a nearby bush. otis looked friendly and happy, but he'd dash away the moment you got near him.
and, i should clarify, otis is the name i decided on when i made it a personal pet project to round otis up and bring him to the shelter. this led to several days' worth of coyote-and-roadrunner situations, including one that had me sprinting down the back alley with a leash, a jar of peanut butter and a schnauzer just a few yards ahead of me.
i had a lot of time to focus on this task, since my wife had moved across the country to washington, and i was still looking for a job out there. after day two or three, she gently suggested that perhaps the otis mission had just a little bit to do with the stress of a job search, and i conceded she may have been onto something.
a neighbor and i finally rounded otis up, and i confirmed — after repeated calls to the shelter — that he found a happy ending somewhere in the pacific northwest.
but i hate to tell you, america's only elected dogcatcher did not get that same happy ending.
turns out, it is against vermont law for a town to elect its own dogcatcher. after our story aired, someone from duxbury got in touch with the vermont league of cities and towns. a lawyer there pointed out the bad news: dogcatcher is not an official elected position in the state. for now, dogcatchers can only be appointed.
towne still has a job though. someone moved to appoint him dogcatcher, and the vote was unanimous. he even got an assistant.
i guess duxbury has a lot of dogs on the loose. but if the town ever does change its rules and get the ok from the state to bring back elections, i may just have to run a carpetbagger campaign and challenge towne.
establishment republicans scramble to top trump
enlarge this image toggle caption matt rourke/ap matt rourke/ap
new hampshire republicans have a track record of picking presidential candidates who often go on to win their party's nomination. usually, that means bolstering establishment candidates. but this year, billionaire donald trump is polling far ahead of the rest of the pack. that leaves his rivals fighting amongst themselves in the hope that one of them can take down trump in the state that holds the first primary.
there's not much time left for establishment republicans to settle on a favorite. and with no clear challenger to trump's dominance in new hampshire, other candidates and their superpacs are lobbing attack ads at each other.
one ad from new jersey gov. chris christie opens with the words, marco rubio is attacking gov. chris christie. it's a response to the florida senator's criticism of christie's record on a range of issues, including gun control.
that back and forth continued on the campaign trail in new hampshire on friday. during a stop at a weapons factory in newport, rubio was presented with a hunting rifle before addressing a room full of plant workers.
i'm gonna tell you what's really important, that our nominee be someone who is a strong supporter of the second amendment. and there are republicans running who are not supporters of the second amendment, in the way you and i want them to be, rubio said.
in addition to attacking christie's record on gun control, which evolved over time, rubio has made an issue of christie's close working relationship with president obama after hurricane sandy battered new jersey. it's all meant to question christie's conservative credentials.
a few hours later in hollis, n.h., rubio himself was the target of attacks from former florida gov. jeb bush.
the senators sometimes get off into their world, their little ecosystem of washington, d.c.-talk. i don't know if you've noticed. it's mind-numbing, actually, bush said.
bush joked that rubio, and sen. ted cruz of texas, live in an alternative universe. he also took aim at trump, after a member of the audience asked how bush could distinguish himself in a year when voters seem to favor big personalities. bush said he plans to stay the course, arguing that having the ideas and experience to be president should be enough.
and if it isn't, i'm not gonna change who i am. i'm just not gonna do it. i'm not gonna play the game. i'm not gonna insult someone just because i'm told that's the way to connect with voters, bush said. really? really? i mean trump does this, and it sets me off.
afterward as the crowd thinned, milt janosky and jim polus, both of hollis, stayed to chat about the race. janosky said he likes bush, but he's also considering christie, ohio gov. john kasich, and former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina.
janosky said he's definitely not voting for trump, calling him dangerous.
polus is supporting bush, but said there are a lot of good establishment choices.
people like myself and milt – we have three or four candidates that we think could be good. so that vote is being split four different ways, he said.
janosky said those voters could easily defeat trump — if they could just settle on one candidate they could all support.
small donors power and inspire the sanders campaign

when bernie sanders took the stage sunday night in madison, wis., the crowd of about 5,000 went wild. one of the biggest applause lines came when sanders talked about his campaign taking on the establishment.
these guys may have unlimited sums of money, the vermont senator said. they may control the media, they may control the economy, they may control the political system. but when millions of people stand up together united and demand change, we will not be stopped.
sanders' supporters aren't just cheering him on, they are donating to the cause. one supporter at last night's rally, joe eichenseher, said he has contributed to past campaigns, but never with the frequency he is giving to sanders.
i feel like it's a people's campaign, and it's what democracy should be, he said. it should be from the people.
the people are giving, again and again. in march, sanders raised $44 million.
that ability to raise large sums of money in tiny increments has enabled the sanders campaign to outspend hillary clinton on television advertising in more than a dozen states. it's also allowed him to claim purity, while implying clinton is beholden to big-money interests.
we have revolutionized campaign financing in the united states of america, sanders said over the weekend. i don't have a superpac. i don't get money from wall street or anybody else and i am proud of that.
revolution may be overstating things, according to julia azari, who teaches political science at marquette university in milwaukee.
the small-donors movement has been going on for a while now, azari says. obama also talked a lot about that in 2008. i don't know that sanders has caused that so much as he's coming in at a time where that narrative seems to be pretty popular.
opinion polling reveals a widespread public disgust with the nation's campaign finance system. republican ted cruz boasts of his small-dollar donors. donald trump says because of his personal wealth he can't be bought. and clinton's campaign touts support from more than a million individual donors.
but clinton has also raised money in a more traditional way than sanders — with a mix of small online donations and big-dollar fundraisers in the homes of the rich and famous. she also has a superpac backing her. even so, clinton has, since the very first day of her campaign, criticized the system.
we need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, clinton says, even if that takes a constitutional amendment.
however, the clinton campaign also said early on it wouldn't unilaterally disarm, with conservative superpacs lined up against her. clinton is also doing something sanders is not. she has raised nearly $30 million for the democratic party and state party committees. that money will be used to help elect candidates further down on the ballot as well as the democratic presidential nominee - whether that's clinton or sanders.
a biden cabinet secretary for arts? advocates are hopeful

arts and culture make up a huge, $877 billion industry that generates more than five million jobs across the country. but the amount of federal funding for the arts is tiny when compared with smaller industries like agriculture — so what are arts organizations hoping for under the biden administration?
the national endowment for the arts gives grants to organizations across the country — from big ones like lincoln center and npr to small ones like the wichita falls alliance for arts and culture. west texas wichita falls. we're not in kansas, says executive director margie reese, who adds that her group used one of their nea grants to commission regional artists to make murals in economically distressed areas.
for vernon, texas, 25 year old selena mize painted musician and native son, the late roy orbison. it was a name mize didn't know — until reese played her one of his songs, pretty woman.
the power of visual arts to bring a community back to life — this is what our attempt was with that mural.
at first i didn't know that was roy orbison, mize laughs. i thought it was elvis presley. she says growing up she heard both singers while listening to music with her father and grandparents. her mural shows orbison with his trademark dark sunglasses, playing his guitar. she says the attention she got for the work was life-changing. the community was very excited and open about it, and it's just something i would never forget.
this bright, sunshiny mural is bringing pride back to vernon, texas, reese says. the power of visual arts to bring a community back to life — this is what our attempt was with that mural.
when it comes to government support of the arts, reese is a veteran, having worked in the cultural affairs departments in dallas and los angeles. she's seen presidents and nea chairs come and go. when you have a change in administration and a shift in philosophy about arts funding, she says, the entire field begins to worry about what's going to happen, how is this change going to affect us?
steady is the word reese uses to describe federal arts funding under president trump. even though each of his budgets proposed eliminating the arts and humanities endowments — as well as the institute of museum and library services — congress rejected the cuts.
there's a lot of love for libraries and for museums inside the beltway, says crosby kemper, who was the trump administration's pick to head the imls. like the endowments, the institute distributes grants, conducts research and helps shape policies that affect museums and libraries. even though republicans often talk about cutting funding for the arts, kemper points out that all three budgets have increased slightly over the last three years: i think you have to look at what actually happens, and what actually happens for the imls, the nea and the neh is they have a lot of support in the political world — and including inside the administration.
but for actor kal penn, trump's rhetoric has been damaging to the arts. penn was appointed by president obama to the president's committee on the arts and humanities, an advisory group founded in 1982. he had planned to stay on, but after trump's handling of the deadly white supremacist rally in charlottesville, he and everyone else on the committee resigned.
the president's committee on the arts and humanities was then never relaunched under the trump administration, just to show you that it really wasn't a priority at all, he says.
penn says he wants to see the biden administration give the endowments an astronomical increase.
i think it's important now more than ever to be bold, he says, noting that the arts benefit education, innovation, mental and emotional health. plus, he says, it's a good investment.
when you say, ok, well, why did you spend all this money to save this theater — yes, you're saving the theater, and maybe you're saving the 500 jobs that the theater provides for the local community, but you're also then saving the restaurants that people go to the night of the show, he says. you're saving the hotels that the visiting artists stay at. you're saving, you know, the the parking facility. and it may sound like very little, but when you when you start to multiply that by the numbers of businesses like this that exist around the country, you can see why investing in in the arts really makes economic sense.
earlier this year, the bureau of economic analysis and the national endowment for the arts released a report that said the arts contributed 4.5 percent to the country's gdp in 2017. that's more than agriculture and transportation. arts advocate charles segars, head of the ovation tv network, says it's time for the arts to be taken just as seriously by the white house, by creating a cabinet level secretary of arts and culture.
it centralizes, in the positive sense of the word, all of the leverage of the united states government. remember, you have arts pockets throughout the department of state, department of defense. even transportation and agriculture has a taste of that, of arts programs that they help support.
segars says the cabinet-level position would also handle intellectual property rights and exports. years ago, music producer quincy jones tried to get obama to create a secretary of arts; it never happened, but segars says he thinks it's a realistic goal. i think it's going to take time, he says, but we all have to talk about it.
crosby kemper of the imls says he can't predict what the next administration will do, but he thinks biden's personality points in that direction. i'd say the first and most important thing is that he's a great lover of irish poetry and therefore a clearly a civilized man.
the biden transition team did not respond to requests for comment.

democrats unveil legislation to abolish the federal death penalty
enlarge this image toggle caption michael conroy/ap michael conroy/ap
sen. dick durbin, d-illinois, the incoming chair of the senate judiciary committee, and rep. ayanna pressley, d-mass., are unveiling legislation that would seek to end federal capital punishment, putting a focus on the issue as their party prepares to take over complete control of congress, along with the white house.
the democratic proposal, shared first with npr, comes as the party will have unified control of congress after victories in two georgia senate races, a change in fortunes for democratic legislative priorities. the legislation would end capital punishment at the federal level and require the resentencing of all federal inmates on death row.
there are three lives that hang in the balance this week alone, pressley said, speaking along with durbin in an exclusive joint interview. and this is why we reintroduced this bill this week and are urging congress to act immediately to pass it. state-sanctioned murder is not justice.
former attorney general william barr announced in july 2019 that the justice department would resume federal executions, ending what had been a nearly two-decade hiatus. at the time, barr and justice department officials said they were carrying out the will of judges and juries and providing justice for staggeringly brutal murders.
the federal government executed 10 prisoners last year, more civilian prisoners than all the states combined over the same period. and more executions are scheduled for the final days of the trump administration before president-elect joe biden takes office.
here we are in the closing hours of the trump administration, when they are in a mad dash to give pardons for federal crimes committed by their friends, and an equally mad dash to try to execute these people who have been on death row for years, if not decades, said durbin, who will take over as chairman of the senate judiciary committee in the coming weeks. that is just unconscionable.
for his part, biden has said he wants to work with congress to pass a law to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and to incentivize states to follow that example.
last year, transition spokesman t.j. ducklo told npr that the president-elect opposes the death penalty, now and in the future, and as president will work to end its use.
pressley said she has been in active conversation with the biden-harris transition team about the issue, and that she is very optimistic about the chances for passage of the legislation. late last year, she led her colleagues in a letter to the incoming administration, calling on it to abolish the death penalty as well as to use executive action to end all federal executions.
i'm calling on him to use that full authority with the stroke of a pen to halt all federal executions and save lives, pressley said. he should also require the department of justice to no longer seek the death penalty for future cases, and permanently dismantle the terre haute facility where those federal executions take place.
but ultimately, pressley said, passing the legislation is critical so that the end of capital punishment at the federal level has the force of law, preventing a future president from reinstating it.
give that the senate will be divided 50-50, with vice president-elect kamala harris as the tiebreaker, there will still be partisan hurdles to cross. it is unclear whether such a proposal would garner support among house and senate republicans.
durbin said that the senate will still take up a broader criminal justice reform package.
the senate judiciary committee, throughout our modern history, has always played a leadership role on issues of the moment, durbin said. it really was the focal point of a national conversation on issues of justice. it unfortunately, in the last few years abandoned that role.
durbin added that he hopes that as chairman, we can restore the role of this committee in the new congress on a bipartisan basis.
support for capital punishment is at its lowest point over the past five decades, according to gallup polling. while there have been declines in support for the death penalty among democrats and independents, according to gallup's historical data, support among republicans has remained relatively steady.
pressley said she believes there was a very significant flashpoint in the debate over capital punishment when the justice department proceeded last month with the execution of brandon bernard. bernard spent more than half of his life on death row for a crime committed when he was 18. in the final days of his life, he pleaded with president trump to grant him clemency, and his case drew high-profile attention.
pressley, who introduced similar legislation in 2019, said that she saw an outpouring of support for ending federal capital punishment in the days surrounding bernard's execution.
durbin also acknowledged changing public sentiment.
because of dna and other methods of investigation, we have discovered that many people who have been sentenced to death were innocent, durbin said. one-hundred seventy-three people in the last few years have been exonerated on death row. we got it wrong. the system of justice failed.
one of the longest-standing criticisms of capital punishment is the racial disparities in the united states. some studies have shown that defendants convicted of killing white victims are sentenced more harshly than those who have killed black victims.
while we're in the midst of this national reckoning on racial justice, abolishing the death penalty must be a part of that discourse but also our legislative actions, pressley said.
durbin added, if we truly believe that all lives matter, and black lives matter, and brown lives matter and the lives of poor people matter, it's time for us to make sure that our system of justice reflects that.
ohio primary postponed at last minute due to coronavirus after legal struggle
enlarge this image toggle caption gene j. puskar/ap gene j. puskar/ap
updated at 9:05 a.m. et tuesday
after intense legal wrangling, ohio postponed its tuesday primary election just hours before polls were set to open.
early tuesday morning, the state supreme court denied a judge's attempt to let the primary continue after gov. mike dewine had asked the court to delay the primary until june 2 because of the coronavirus outbreak.
late monday evening, dewine sought to bypass the judge by announcing that ohio health director amy acton would order the polls closed as a health emergency.
three other states — arizona, florida and illinois — are still holding primaries on tuesday.
we've had to make a lot of tough decisions over the past few weeks, but everything we've done has been about saving lives, dewine tweeted tuesday morning. if we don't take these actions now, it'll be too late. this is quite literally a matter of life and death.
secretary of state frank larose had issued guidance to all county boards of elections in ohio on monday that they must post notice on their websites, social media, at the board of elections, and at polling places that in-person voting for the march 17, 2020 presidential primary election is suspended.
during my service overseas, i've witnessed people risking their lives to cast a ballot, larose told npr on monday night. i've walked in the footsteps of heroes on the streets of selma, ala., where people had to fight for the right to vote. elections are something i don't take lightly. the only thing in the world that i think that takes precedent over conducting this free and fair election is the health and safety of ohioans.
ohio's initial announcement came at roughly the same time that president trump was laying out new guidelines for americans that include avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people for the rest of the month.
in a joint statement, dewine and larose said monday that the public health warnings to limit gatherings means it simply isn't possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by ohioans.
unlike many states, ohio's governor and secretary of state don't have the power to delay the election on their own. instead, with the approval of both political parties, they supported a lawsuit filed by people who believe they're vulnerable to the virus and did not plan to contest the suit.
people should not have to choose between their rights and their health, dewine said.
a number of voting-rights advocacy groups also supported the decision, including the league of women voters and the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law.
also on monday, kentucky postponed its may 19 primary to june 23. unlike ohio, kentucky state law allows the secretary of state and governor to jointly decide to change the date of an election due to a declared state of emergency.
in a statement on monday, larose said the sudden announcement less than 24 hours before the election was made after new information about the virus led the ohio department of health to recommend that all ohioans age 65 and older self-quarantine.
under the plan he is proposing, absentee voting would be allowed to continue until june 2, and all votes that have already been cast would be counted as normal.
president trump said monday that he thought postponing the primaries was unnecessary but also said the decision was ultimately up to the respective states.
former vice president joe biden's campaign said in a statement, we will follow the guidance offered by state public health officials for how to best ensure that their populations are looked after while encouraging participation in our democracy.
ohio is now the fourth state to postpone its primary because of the coronavirus. louisiana announced late last week that it would push its april primary to june, while georgia announced over the weekend that its march 24 primary would be moved to may. separately, alabama is considering postponing its march 31 u.s. senate primary runoff.
in retrospect, it may be that we view these delays as being lifesavers, said charles stewart, an elections expert at the massachusetts institute of technology. on the other hand, it could be that we view the delays as being overreaches. we just don't know at this point.
how scientists trace new coronavirus variants
npr's ailsa chang talks with biologists pardis sabeti and sharon peacock about how genomic sequencing was used in the u.k. to trace a new coronavirus variant and what the u.s. can learn from it.
a new variant of the coronavirus has now been found in at least 10 states. the strain, known as b117, is thought to be more contagious. and u.k. scientists first alerted the world about it in december. in the meantime, we have heard reports of other additional variants found in south africa and in japan. so what does this say about the coronavirus' ability to evolve and our ability to fight it?
well, i have a couple of virus detectives with me now. pardis sabeti is a computational biologist at the broad institute in massachusetts, and sharon peacock is the director of the covid-19 genomics u.k. consortium. welcome to both of you.
pardis sabeti: it's a pleasure to be here.
sharon peacock: thank you very much.
chang: so dr. peacock, let's just start with you. you know, it was your team that helped track down this new covid variant. can you just explain - how did you first figure out that you found something new?
peacock: well, there are many, many mutations in the viral population. and what you need to do is look for a signal in people for some different viral behavior. and so in december, what we noticed was that there were numbers of cases of covid-19 in people in the south of england.
now, they were under lockdown restrictions. and strangely, in other parts of the country, that same lockdown was controlling the disease very well. but in the south of england, it wasn't managing to control spread of the infection. and so at that point during the investigation - the outbreak investigation - it became very apparent this was associated with this new variant, which contained a large number of mutations, which we hadn't seen before. and that's what really set it off.
chang: ok. and how different, exactly, is this strain - b117 - from the initial strain sequenced in china at the very beginning of the pandemic? like, how different both genetically and how different in the way the two viruses interact with us as human hosts?
peacock: this virus is actually strikingly different, and it has 23 different mutations. and what concerns us is that some of those mutations are in part of the virus called the spike protein, which is the protein that interacts with humans and attaches to human cells and is part of the entry process into the body. and so this is actually very unusual. but in particular, it has mutations that could change the biology - the way that the virus interacts with humans.
chang: well, ok. dr. sabeti, along with the u.k. variant, scientists have found other significant variants in south africa and in japan. is that all that surprising to you or were scientists expecting this to happen as we got deeper and deeper into the pandemic?
sabeti: you know, these are viruses, and like everything on earth, they change over time. but viruses, in particular, they're replicating and spreading quickly, and they have high mutation rates compared to us. just the way that their biological machinery works is they're making more changes each time they replicate. so this is expected. we saw during the ebola outbreak, during the previous sars outbreaks, during every outbreak, you know, that happens, viruses are mutating all the time. that's what we expect.
chang: so can tracking these sorts of variants help us curb the spread of the virus in some way?
sabeti: it can. and, you know, i think it's very important to do - as the u.k. did - is to be able to scan at high resolution in real time, or near real time. because if you do identify something like the b117 mutation, and you notice, hey, there's something going on in this part of the country and oh, there's this new variant to pay attention to, we can scan for where that variant is occurring and try to then move our public health resources, which are inherently limited, but to take all the resources we can to stop that variant from going anywhere.
chang: well, given that this u.k. strain appears to be more contagious, let me ask both of you this question. does our current public health guidance around social distancing and mask wearing, does that need to change?
peacock: there's no reason to think that standard advice about infection prevention and control needs to change. so we still need to wash our hands, wear masks and distant - socially distance. and so it is more contagious, but there's every reason to think that if we follow the guidance, that disease transmission can be reduced and prevented.
sabeti: yeah. i think that the guidelines that we have in place are very good. and they work for most viruses - you know, washing hands and social distancing, wearing masks. the more contagious a virus, the more it means we have to be really regimented about that. and any breaches at all, and you could have mass containment failure. and so it just makes us have to really ante up on those.
chang: so, you know, this strain, as we keep saying, was first detected in the u.k. so let me ask you, dr. sabeti - how equipped do you think the u.s. is to detect these kinds of genetic changes in the virus moving forward?
sabeti: the u.s. is very equipped to detect these kinds of mutations, and they have been doing across the board. the difference between the u.k. and the u.s. in this instance is the u.k., on a national level, really put down a lot of funds and support and made this a priority whereas - i'll say that my colleagues and i here in the u.s., most of this work is done on our discretionary funds, on very limited budgets. and so we're very poised and doing a lot of great and exciting sequencing across the u.s., but not at the level and the scale that's needed. and so we've been calling for some time - for many, many years - to have national funding to scale this up. we're poised and able to do it. literally, it's just about getting more sequences through the pipeline, which is more funding and support and prioritization of the need.
chang: so as this pandemic continues to drag on, what else will you be watching for? like, are you going to be expecting more strains to emerge?
peacock: i think it's very likely that we'll see new variants emerge. and what we're really watching for are variants that actually are transmissible, but that actually have the ability to escape immunity. so that's either the immunity that's acquired naturally if you have covid-19 once or immunity that's developed through vaccination. so in particular, looking for combinations of mutations that could allow a virus to be very fit and spread amongst the population, but that could also threaten the efficacy of vaccines.
the other thing we worry about is mutations that could affect the way that diagnostic tests can work. so some mutations can affect the ability of a diagnostic test to detect the virus. so also looking out for those types of mutations.
chang: that is sharon peacock, director of the covid-19 genomics u.k. consortium, and pardis sabeti of the broad institute. thank you to both of you.

trump's gunboat diplomacy in asia may prove quite different from syria
enlarge this image toggle caption bullit marquez/ap bullit marquez/ap
president trump is responding to another tough foreign policy crisis with gunboat diplomacy, but the second deployment is likely to look very different from the first.
u.s. pacific command has ordered the aircraft carrier uss carl vinson and its strike group, which includes a cruiser and two destroyers, to report on station in the western pacific ocean, instead of sailing for australia as planned.
the navy's official announcement about the decision did not mention north korea, but leaders in washington hope that leaders in its capital, pyongyang, will get the picture.
the strike group is heading back to korean waters — it also visited last month — following north korea's launch of a ballistic missile ahead of the recent visit by chinese president xi jinping to trump's golf resort in florida. something else also has happened since then: trump ordered u.s. navy warships on the other side of the world to attack a syrian airfield after warplanes based there used chemical weapons in an airstrike that killed scores of people in idlib, including children.
trump's choice to launch that missile strike was a surprise about-face after administration officials appeared to take the heat off syria's president, bashar assad, saying the u.s. would scrap its previous position that assad could no longer govern. as the world continues watching to see whether trump's attack was a one-time outing designed to send a message — or the first shot in a new war against assad's regime — north korea's regime has new reason for pause.
north korea is looking for trouble, trump wrote on twitter on tuesday. if china decides to help, that would be great. if not, we will solve the problem without them! u.s.a.
the president's warning followed tough talk over the weekend by other administration leaders.
this is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime, and president xi and president trump agreed that that is unacceptable, national security adviser h.r. mcmaster said on fox news sunday. the president has asked us to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat to the american people and to our allies and partners in the region.
and before that, secretary of state rex tillerson said that all options are on the table as the trump administration calculates how to deal with the threats north korea poses to its neighbors and, potentially, the united states.
in practical terms, however, trump and his aides may be able to do less than they did in syria. in that case, tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two navy destroyers destroyed syrian warplanes, air defense systems, fuel and other supplies. but nothing similar is likely from the carl vinson or its escorts — in fact, if any shots are fired it could be the start of a serious major conflict.
in syria, the united states could hit a target with a low chance of it striking back, in the midst of a conflict that's already been raging for years. in korea, kim jong un has many potential ways to respond quickly and savagely by lashing out at a close u.s. ally, south korea, which hosts nearly 30,000 u.s. troops to help defend it.
that means the navy can't change the conversation by hitting north korea with a few cruise missiles the way it did in syria. north and south korea have tens of thousands of troops and huge arsenals pointed at each other on each side of the demilitarized zone that separates them. occasional flare-ups since the armistice in 1953 have claimed some lives, but the peninsula hasn't seen major combat.
the stakes, however, are higher than they've ever been: north korea is building nuclear weapons and marching toward the ability to fit them atop its ballistic missiles. that means it could hit south korea; another archenemy, japan; or potentially even the continental united states in a few years.
north korea says that it would respond to any military action by ordering a full retaliation, putting millions of lives in immediate danger. pyongyang has further compounded the problem by deploying its ballistic missiles on mobile launchers. if a crisis reached a flashpoint, north korea watchers say there's no guarantee the u.s. military could find and destroy all the missiles quickly enough to stop a launch.
there's also no telling how north korea's youthful strongman, kim jong un, might respond to a serious military crisis, or how brittle his regime might prove. if kim and his top aides were killed in a u.s. attempt to decapitate north korea before it could order a ballistic attack, that might cause the whole government to collapse.
north korea's patron, china, which supplies much of its food and fuel, would not look kindly on any such outcome, or on any military action by the united states. beijing faulted trump's attack on syria after xi's visit and although the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized korean peninsula, per the white house, china has given trump no commitment to rein in kim.
pyongyang, meanwhile, warned of catastrophic consequences if washington tried to follow up its syria attack in north korea.
that's actually a step down from north korea's rhetoric from the last time the carl vinson strike group sailed near the korean peninsula, when it said a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier.
but despite all the supercharged rhetoric and intense regional scrutiny, the ships came and went then without incident, the way american warships have for decades. as the carl vinson and its escorts make their way north again now, the world is watching to see whether this visit also goes according to routine.
sanders supporter creates superdelegate 'hit list'; superdelegates not amused
enlarge this image toggle caption super delegate list/screen shot by npr super delegate list/screen shot by npr
to bernie sanders supporters, the idea that democratic superdelegates — elected officials and other party elites who can vote however they wish at the convention — could tip the nomination to hillary clinton seems terribly undemocratic.
and so, they're trying to convince superdelegates, officially known as unpledged party leaders and elected officials, to change their allegiance.
there are several online petitions. one calls for the elimination of superdelegates altogether. another asks superdelegates to align their choice with regular voters, not party elites, and it has more than 200,000 signatures.
at the moment, more than halfway through the primary process, this would favor clinton, who leads the popular vote by more than 2 million votes and has a more than 200-pledged-delegate lead (that is, delegates who align with the results of state primaries and caucuses).
but sanders supporters point to the senator's string of recent wins and figure by the time the last vote is counted in california, he will have the popular lead. and then, under this scenario, it will be up to superdelegates, who make up roughly 15 percent of total convention delegates, to decide who gets the nomination.
enlarge this image toggle caption mary altaffer/ap mary altaffer/ap
nobody is going to arrive in philadelphia with enough delegates to win the nomination, said jeff weaver, sanders' campaign manager. and the superdelegates don't vote until you actually get into the convention process. so there's been a lot of talk about how the republicans are going into an open convention. well, the truth of the matter is, it looks like the democrats are going into an open convention as well.
it's true that no one will likely have the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination strictly out of the pledged delegates. but that's also because that number is a majority of all the voting delegates, which includes superdelegates.
the sanders campaign still has its focus on winning as many pledged delegates as possible in the states still yet to vote, like new york, pennsylvania and california and the campaign is trying to direct supporters looking to help to volunteering or organizing in those states. in fact the campaign's website lists hundreds of organizing events, many posted by volunteers, but the campaign has moved to remove any events related to reaching out to superdelegates.
but this hasn't stopped sanders' enthusiastic supporters from taking matters into their own hands. this week, a sanders fan named spencer thayer created the superdelegate hit list, a website to compile and share the contact information of superdelegates, so they can be persuaded. it is not affiliated with the sanders campaign, but a campaign spokesman didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.
thayer, who answered questions over email, later changed the name simply to superdelegate list.
the intent of the branding was to parody the famous clinton hit list, this was a tongue–in–cheek attempt at parody which i thought would encourage resharing, thayer said. the branding began to detract from the campaign's purpose, so it wasn't a hard decision to make the change once it was clear it wasn't working.
thayer's goal with the site was to make it easier for voters to get in touch with superdelegates.
toggle caption super delegate hit list/screen shot by npr
the superdelegate system is rigged to protect establishment politicians and shut down populism, thayer said. superdelegates, by their very nature, diminish the value of the vote by giving an elite constituency of representatives, party leaders, and even lobbyists extra power. the superdelegate list exists to help voters challenge this undemocratic system. contacting our elected representatives and party leaders and holding them to account is an american tradition. this is the only way to keep the voter base from being patronized or ignored.
superdelegates have been hearing from sanders supporters for months — and it's not always pleasant. akilah ross ensley is with the young democrats of america, and she's a superdelegate who plans to support clinton. she has to check her professional facebook page several times a day to deal with all the messages and posts.
you should be ashamed of yourself, ensley reads from a recent facebook message she received. maybe you will do some soul searching and have some integrity and think about the decisions you're making and its implications.
ensley said she's been called names, and there have been expletives.
they said, you know, you should go to hell, said ensley, describing another message. how dare you vote against your own interests as an african-american woman. i expected you would be smarter than that.
when clinton-backing super delegate joyce elliott heard she was on, what at the time was called the superdelegate hit list, she was taken aback.
that is, that is very interesting, elliott said after laughing uncomfortably. as far as i know, this is probably only the second time i've been on a hit list, and the other one was not pleasant.
elliott is a state senator in arkansas and the last time she was on a hit list, it was over legislation she had introduced. that time, she said, the fbi got involved. this list isn't as scary. although, she has heard from 20 or 30 sanders supporters trying to get her to switch.
some of them will tell me, you know, how awful hillary is, therefore, i should support bernie, and then tell me how great bernie is, said elliott, who has known the clintons since the 1970s. and that's the kind of thing i think that is not helpful.
for ken martin, the chairman of the minnesota democratic party, the flow of messages is constant — 20 a day, he said. his state went for sanders in its caucuses, and the pressure to switch from clinton to sanders is intense.
someone received my cellphone number, and they posted that, and so i'm getting calls on my personal cellphone from people all over the country, martin said.
when thayer, the creator of the superdelegate list, was told people were feeling harassed and unpersuaded, here's what he said:
it's likely that most callers are actually polite. if a few people contacting superdelegates are being obscene they'll of course drown out reasonable voices and harden opinions. however, it's useful to look at what's causing some of the anger and outrage we're seeing. voters know they are being disenfranchised by superdelegate influence and these privileged voters are a reasonable target for frustration. and, let's be honest, if superdelegates aren't prepared to deal with the public, they shouldn't be party officials.
but all this freelance lobbying may be unnecessary. it has been the tradition of superdelegates, even in contentious primaries, to ultimately vote at the convention for the candidate with the most popular votes and pledged delegates.
tad devine, a senior adviser to sanders' campaign, was actually involved in the creation of superdelegates, as a way to get party officials more involved in selecting the democratic nominee.
that was always done with the understanding that the voters would determine the outcome of this process, and i think they'll do it this time, devine said back in february when the superdelegate controversy was flaring up after the new hampshire primary.
in vermont, a town is divided over syrian refugees

last week, the first two of an expected 25 syrian refugee families arrived in rutland, vt., a scenic, blue-collar town of 16,000 people.
now that president trump is expected to call for a temporary ban on syrian refugees entering the u.s., these families may never be joined by the 23 others.
for some in rutland, that's welcome news. but others say this rural community desperately needs the youth and diversity refugees would bring.
the two syrian families — four adults and five children — arrived without fanfare, at night. they were exhausted after two days of travel from turkey.
rutland mayor christopher louras, a champion of refugee resettlement, helped both families move in with host families. the newcomers hope to have their own apartments soon.
as our new neighbors were fleeing for their lives, coming to a new home a half a world away to rebuild those lives, they needed to understand that they were welcome, he said.
speaking through an interpreter this week, members of one family said they felt relieved to be in vermont. at first, we came here, and we were surprised by the very, very, warm welcome by the people of rutland, one syrian said. the mayor, our caseworker, our host family, all came and welcomed us, and since then, it never stopped, and people have just welcomed us and helped us in every way.
last year, louras applied on behalf of rutland to receive the syrian refugees, beating out several other vermont towns to do so.

since then, volunteers in town have been active for months, gathering donations and furniture for the new families, taking free arabic classes and attending seminars on middle eastern history and syrian culture. the local high school is planning a syrian dinner to help introduce the refugee families to their new community.
despite all the excitement and goodwill, there remains an uncomfortable divide over bringing syrians to town.
you get a sense of it at the local farmers market, where vendors sell everything from kombucha and winter vegetables to steaming cups of mulled cider.
some in the crowd worry about the vetting process for refugees — is it strong enough? others are more concerned about the cost of refugee resettlement and how it will affect city and school budgets.
local school officials and the mayor have assured residents that the newcomers won't be a burden or cost local taxpayers more, but many are still not convinced.
michael spafford, 51, took a break from selling fudge to admit he's torn by the issue.
i know the mayor and i know his family, says spafford. i know they were from greece. and my family was from italy. i get that america is open-arms to all the people from different countries and that we're a melting pot. but what i'm concerned about is, i know people who are living in the woods because they're poor and homeless, and i know veterans who aren't getting proper care.
spafford says he can't forget something president trump said recently, that america is giving money out to so many other countries and so many areas. i can't help but think we should be taking care of our own first.
spafford pauses. i know that comes across as selfish, he says, and my heart aches for the refugees. but my heart also aches for the locals, our own, first.
refugee proponents — and there are many in rutland — counter it's not an either-or dilemma. but it's a debate that's been raging for months.
back in april, when louras announced plans to bring in the refugee families, many were surprised. rutland has never taken in refugees before. the mayor emphasized that helping syrians was the right thing to do. but he also believes refugees can help solve a problem: rutland's shrinking population.

lyle jepson, executive director of the rutland economic development corp., says the city's population is expected to decline by 10 percent to 16 percent by 2030. most of that drop will be among those younger than 50.
what that means is we're entering a crisis period, says jepson. we are retiring, we are living much longer and there are fewer people coming in to replace us.
vermont's median age, 42, is the second-highest in the country. only maine skews older. a report by the vermont chamber foundation projects that the entire state will need nearly 11,000 new employees every year until 2040 to replace retirees and fill new jobs.
we hear people say our children are leaving because there are no jobs here, jepson says. but we need to change that narrative — because there are jobs here.
he says young, motivated refugees would be a welcome part of the talent pool in rutland. the newcomers from syria include people who are multilingual. one of the refugees holds a degree in french literature.
depending on their skills, jepson says they might find work with local hotels, nursing homes, the nearby killington ski resort, the regional hospital or local ge plant.
back at the farmers market, josh squire wraps up a sale at his vegetable stand. the 32-year-old farmer moved to rutland from delaware, which he describes as much more culturally diverse. rutland, he says, would benefit from more diversity.
different ideas can spur a new business, and that new business brings in money for the economy. those people who are working in that new business can now come to my business and, like, it'll spread. so having even a couple hundred more people in our little town, it's going to make a big difference for us, he says, smiling.
but his shoulders sag as he admits that he worries if the u.s. scales back its refugee programs, rutland's first two syrian families could be the last.
a weightlifting program gives ex-cons a chance at change
enlarge this image toggle caption jesse costa/wbur jesse costa/wbur
it began with a simple idea: provide a safe place in boston where ex-cons and former gang members can work out, find support and maybe even get a job. the result is innercity weightlifting, a nonprofit also known as icw that connects them with job training, workout clients and a chance at a new life.
just about all of the trainers have done significant time in jail. they've shot people and been shot at. dan royal grew up in boston and was 11 the first time he was arrested on a shooting charge.
i got shot before that. my relative died right in front of my face. also, i've been shot eight times. i've been shot once in the middle of my head, between my eyes. i've got two brain surgeries, royal says.
royal is 36 and has been out of jail for three years. for that, he credits icw, where he works as a personal trainer. it gives him an income and a network of support.
dan is someone who i consider a close friend. i was also told not to work with him, as i've been told not to work with a lot of our students, says jon feinman, innercity weightlifting's ceo.
feinman grew up in leafy western massachusetts, a world away from the inner city. he ignored warnings that guys like royal were too dangerous to work with. after college and a stint at americorps, feinman founded icw to help people break free of the cycle of crime and incarceration by teaching them to be personal trainers. it also gives potential clients a chance to connect with people like royal.
the program helps the trainers build what feinman calls social capital. for example, jay buchta, a business development executive who trains with royal, says he helped royal at his last court hearing by reaching out to a friend, a former prosecutor, and vouching for him.
and it turned out that my friend and the prosecutor of dan's case had been office mates, so all of a sudden dan had an association ... with someone who wasn't frightening to this attorney, buchta says.
royal, who's off parole now for the first time in his adult life, says making friends with people like buchta has given him hope — and a lot more.
allowing me to see that everything isn't the way i thought it was, you know what i mean? just thinking that a lot of people didn't care, or wasn't going to be anybody attempting to help you, royal says.
about 500 icw clients have a chance to connect with these former inmates — and i've been one of them for more than a year. i work with a trainer named angel lacourt, who grew up in roxbury, one of boston's toughest neighborhoods. his mother was a drug addict and his dad was in prison when he started selling drugs at the age of 8.
all my friends' mothers was on crack. my friends' fathers were selling crack, lacourt says. they either got locked up, went to jail or mainly dead.
despite all of that, lacourt became a high school football star and boston college offered him a full scholarship. but then he shot and wounded a man, ended up in jail and lost the chance to go to college. when he came out, he went back to selling drugs again, was arrested and sent back to prison for 3 1/2 more years. lacourt says he felt trapped in a system that offered no way out.
the day you get out of jail, you're coming home with nothing and you have to start from scratch. you can't get a job at some of these places when they see the criminal background, he says. the only thing you want to do is, i'm going back to selling drugs. and that kinda gets people back into that same cycle: i'm failing, i'm failing, i'm failing. when am i going to succeed?
four years ago, a friend brought lacourt to icw to work out, and he's been there ever since.
icw works with about 140 guys right now; some are certified to work as personal trainers like lacourt, earning as much as $40,000 a year.
when they arrive at icw, recidivism rates are close to 90 percent. but for those who stay with the program that figure plummets to a tiny fraction of that. and staff members say they don't give up on anybody — even those who land back in jail.
instead, we go and visit them in jail. we write them; see what we can do to support their families, says mickey belaineh, who helps run icw.
icw plans to expand to philadelphia next year, even though the staff is aware that a program designed in boston for boston might not work as well in other cities. but lacourt says it can work anywhere there are too many drugs and guns and too few post-incarceration programs like innercity weightlifting, which he says changed his life.
yeah, it helped me out a lot. i think everybody needs to understand: all people need is opportunity, and everyone's willing to change with a little bit of hard work, lacourt says.
instagram account hit with shame campaign after it steals jokes
stealing jokes is as old as comedy itself and it has become increasingly rampant and profitable on instagram. one social media campaign may be forcing a major instagram account to change its behavior.
stealing jokes may be as old as comedy itself. and on instagram, it's particularly rampant and profitable. but as alexi horowitz-ghazi of our planet money team podcast reports, a social media campaign may be forcing one of the biggest instagram curators to change its behavior. and a warning here - this report contains sensitive language we have bleeped out.
alexi horowitz-ghazi, byline: there's a certain kind of instagram account - millions of followers, mostly reposting memes, tweets or jokes from around the web, usually without offering payment, credit or even asking permission from their creators.
megh wright: these accounts have been able to run seemingly with no oversight. it's like the wild west. there's no rules.
horowitz-ghazi: megh wright covers comedy for the entertainment website vulture. she says there's been criticism of this over the years, but it hasn't stopped the problem.
wright: maybe because memes are seen as silly and dumb. and who cares, right? but they've made a ton of money.
horowitz-ghazi: one account in particular caught her eye. we can't say its name on the radio. that's because it's called [expletive]jerry. they were cutting big ad deals. and when wright realized that even comedy central was sponsoring what she considered to be one of instagram's worst offenders, she decided to take action.
wright: i basically just started tweeting a lot until enough comedians, enough people started paying attention and responding to it.
horowitz-ghazi: soon, big-name comedians like patton oswalt and john mulaney joined the pile-on, calling on their fans to unfollow the account. comedian tim heidecker even dropped a diss track.
(soundbite of song, f*** f*** jerry)
tim heidecker: (singing) [expletive] [expletive]jerry. run them out of town. they ain't nothing but two-bit thieves. shut those [expletive] down.
horowitz-ghazi: a big joke-theft shame campaign like this was relatively new to instagram, but not to comedy. chris sprigman of nyu law school says that in stand-up comedy, public shaming often works better than a lawsuit for two main reasons. the first is the way that copyright works. it can protect the specific expression or wording of a joke, but not the idea behind it.
chris sprigman: you can take the specific wording of a joke, rewrite it, and you can escape copyright. you're free to take ideas, even if you can't take expression. so copyright has limited ability to protect jokes.
horowitz-ghazi: the other big reason is economic. it costs money to register the copyright for a given joke, and even more to hire a lawyer to enforce the copyright. it's rarely worth it. so sprigman says comedians developed their own de facto intellectual property norms to make sure their creative innovations are not for naught.
sprigman: the comedic community can start bad-mouthing that person, and then, if that doesn't work, shunning them and refusing to work on a bill with them.
horowitz-ghazi: and sprigman says that's what's happening on instagram right now. in the weeks since the first tweet calling out [expletive]jerry, the account has lost some 300,000 followers. and comedy central announced it would no longer advertise with them.
elliot tebele, the founder of the account, declined to comment for this story, but he did issue a public response on the website medium. he said he's been following the evolving standard practices of instagram. he wrote that when he started, there were no well-established ethical norms about reposting other people's content. he also apologized to anyone who feels they've been wronged in the past. and he committed to a strict, new policy of giving credit and getting permission for every new post going forward.
megh wright at vulture says she's happy that her campaign has helped to push norms in online comedy. she hopes that next, the joke writers themselves can start getting paid. alexi horowitz-ghazi, npr news.

why whole foods' small suppliers think amazon will be good for them
enlarge this image toggle caption daniel acker/bloomberg/getty images daniel acker/bloomberg/getty images
the last few months have not been easy ones for the small companies that supply whole foods with quinoa and kale. as big investors demanded a shake-up at the company, maybe even a takeover by a much bigger supermarket chain, janey hubschman felt that the fate of her own company, epicurean butter, was also at stake.
the fact that their sales have not been great affects every single product that is in whole foods, and their reputation affects everything that is on the shelf, says the colorado businesswoman, who has been selling to whole foods since 2005.
brian nicholson, the president and ceo of red jacket orchards, which sells apples and juices to whole foods, was worried by rumors that private equity firms might acquire the food retailer.
then, on june 16, the long-anticipated takeover announcement came, with amazon as the winner, and many small food companies actually breathed a sigh of relief.
despite amazon's huge size, and its reputation for squeezing out small businesses in sectors such as bookstores, these food companies think the online behemoth's entry into their business could be a good thing.
for some, it's because amazon is familiar. robbie stout of ritual chocolate in utah uses amazon to buy parts for his factory. bebe goodrich of icebox coffee in alabama said amazon is a tremendous part of her life as an entrepreneur and mom of two kids. and hubschman says, i have a box with that little smiley face on my door four times a week. i love amazon.
and paradoxically, many small food companies look at jeff bezos' company, which changed the way people shop, and see a hint of their own desire to shake things up in a food industry that is still dominated by powerhouse manufacturers selling to conventional grocery stores.
whole foods came in as an innovator and others changed to catch up, carrying natural and organic foods, said sylvia wyant, ceo of zest brands llc, which makes cakes and cookies that meet the paleo diet. i see jeff bezos and amazon as innovators, and i see the grocery business needing innovation.
the problem is, amazon-style innovation hasn't always been kind to small businesses or to the types of products whole foods peddles. searches for artisan or  local on amazon prime pantry pull up only a couple dozen results, mostly packaged items like white cheddar popcorn or crackers.
in fact, little about amazon is local, save for the boxes arriving at your door. their mission is to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online. whole foods, on the other hand, built a regional purchasing model that gave stores considerable autonomy in finding local products. at least, that was the case until early 2016, when whole foods shifted all its nonperishable buying to its austin, texas, headquarters.
i think amazon's track record in other sectors indicates they are not deeply invested in creating a decentralized model, says leah douglas, a reporter and analyst with the open markets program at the new america think tank.
amazon could help bring down prices at the stores known for taking your whole paycheck, but that is more likely to benefit customers and to come at a cost for producers.
despite all that, small suppliers persist in their hope, perhaps simply out of instinct. after all, they built their ideas and products from the ground up through optimism. potentially, they say, amazon will open new and better distribution channels, helping them sell products through an online platform with immediate name recognition. the cost of getting products from manufacturing to a retailer the traditional way eats away at profit for businesses like zest, wyant says.

it is hard as a small company to go from a concept to the shelf and then from the shelf to the cart, says indea leo, the founder of lillabee, which makes allergen-free baking mixes in colorado. lillabee was discovered by a whole foods representative while selling at a farmers market and later received a product development loan from the company. we think there is going to be a lot of exciting possibilities of bypassing the shelf altogether and reaching a wider customer base.
while suppliers remain optimistic, more information is still needed before the crystal ball of kombucha and asparagus water clears. the deal will be subject to regulatory approval before it is finalized, and neither amazon nor whole foods has said what will change once the two companies are married.
nicholson, the third-generation apple grower, wonders what this means for the future of groceries. his family recently planted new trees to meet growing demand.
how might we be selling things when that fruit comes available in 10 years? he says. i don't know.

pelosi vows to bring coronavirus bill to house floor as republicans push for changes

updated at 5:25 a.m. et on friday
speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., was unable to reach a deal late thursday on a package of measures to address the coronavirus pandemic amid pushback from the top house republican that the bill comes up short.
negotiations were set to resume on friday on the legislation, which does not include an emergency payroll tax cut — something that president trump has been pressing for congress to pass but that democrats and some republicans have rejected.
however, the deal taking shape would include free coverage for coronavirus testing, extended unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and expanded food assistance as the pandemic takes a larger toll on the u.s. and global economies.
we have — are near — to an agreement, pelosi said at the capitol late thursday.
we've resolved most of our differences and those we haven't, we'll continue the conversation because there will be other bills, she said.
her remarks came as republicans on capitol hill and in the trump administration pushed for changes to the measure. pelosi said house democrats had been negotiating with the white house throughout the morning.
we're dealing with democrats in congress, we'll see what can be done, trump said during an exchange with reporters thursday at the white house. he said democrats had included goodies in their bill that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. he did not give details.
earlier thursday, the panel that sets rules for floor debate paused its meeting as its chairman, rep. jim mcgovern, d-mass., announced pelosi was discussing provisions with treasury secretary steven mnuchin.
he has some suggestions that we are going to evaluate to see whether these are things that we are going to agree on, mcgovern said.
republicans have offered limited changes to the bill, according to several democratic aides involved in the talks. so far the gop proposals under consideration would not fundamentally change the implementation of the proposals, the aides said.
pelosi's spokesman tweeted that the speaker and treasury secretary talked twice about language for the bill.
house minority leader kevin mccarthy of california told reporters the measure comes up short. he said proposals in the democratic measure such as sick leave would take six months to implement.
mccarthy said that the white house, republicans and the speaker's office were working together and that lawmakers should postpone their recess by 24 to 48 hours in order to reach a deal.
let's do what we can do together right now, he said.
we don't need 48 hours, pelosi said. we just need to decide to help families right now.
oklahoma republican rep. tom cole complained that the bill wasn't released until late wednesday night and has had zero republican input.
nobody's prepared to be rolled, cole said, adding, house republicans weren't ready to back the bill and indicated it would have trouble getting the support of gop senators.
senate cancels recess to address coronavirus
as negotiations continued throughout the day on thursday, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., announced the senate would cancel its planned week-long recess next week so it could work on the legislation.
notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the senate will be in session next week. i am glad talks are ongoing between the administration and speaker pelosi. i hope congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong, mcconnell announced on twitter.
democrats push immediate aid; gop says it will take too long
the house democrats' measure includes paid sick leave, which pelosi called very essential, nutrition aid and assistance for states, including unemployment and medicaid costs.
mccarthy listed some of his concerns at a press conference thursday. he told reporters that it would take too long to execute the program which, as written, would require companies with 50 or more employees to pay workers who are laid off, fired or are unable to work because of the coronavirus, or any public health emergency.
republicans have privately raised additional concerns with the unemployment, medicaid and paid family and sick leave portions of the legislation. the unemployment section of the bill would add an extra 26 weeks of benefits for states that experience an increase of 10 percent or more in unemployment rate during the crisis.
gop lawmakers also have objections to the scope of the paid family leave benefits. eligible workers, including people who would not be paid if they miss a day of work, would receive the benefit if they have to miss 14 or more days in a month because of the virus. it would apply to people with a coronavirus diagnosis, people who must self-quarantine, people caring for another person with coronavirus and people who must stay home because of school and child care closings.
the sweeping family leave benefits would extend for one year after the date the bill becomes law — meaning it would expire in the early months of the next presidential term. whoever wins the 2020 election would be responsible for allowing the benefit to lapse or finding a way to extend it.
hill aide tests positive for virus; capitol campus access restricted
the virus affected capitol hill directly as a staffer to sen. maria cantwell, d-wash., became the first known confirmed case of coronavirus on the campus. the aide has been in isolation since developing symptoms, and cantwell closed her office for cleaning, according to a statement. the aide had no known contact with the senator or other members of congress, the statement released wednesday evening said.
the top house and senate law enforcement officials announced thursday that there would be a temporary closure of all tours of the capitol. they also said the capitol building and house and senate office buildings would be limited to members, staff, press and official visitors starting at 5 p.m. on thursday. the measures are in effect until april 1.
arkansas republican sen. tom cotton announced his washington office would be closed. sen. ted cruz, r-texas, who self-quarantined after he was exposed at a conference to someone who tested positive for the virus, also closed his washington office.

saturday sports: the astros' sign-stealing scandal; rule change in women's tennis
just when the week seems low, it's time for sports.
simon: the houston astros say they're sorry, but it didn't make a difference. so come on. get over it. let's move on - while women's tennis will allow in-game coaching. we're joined now by npr sports correspondent tom goldman. tom, thanks for being with us.
tom goldman, byline: thank you, scott.
simon: i'm banging on a trash can.
simon: i'm sending you a signal. what is it?
goldman: how many bangs were that - was that?
goldman: oh, ok. then it's bj (laughter) leiderman, who writes our theme music.
simon: oh, my gosh, man. you got it. that's amazing.
goldman: ...i want you to know your signal didn't have an impact on my answer.
goldman: still - still, i'm sorry. let's move on. ok.
simon: oh, that was so nicely done. i mean, that was a brief apology tour - 90 seconds tops, right?
simon: will it be that the astros went on? is it enough for the fans or other players whose careers they might have harmed?
goldman: i know. it doesn't seem that way. that's the consensus right now. you know, this was intended to mollify the baseball world, including those fans and opposing players, which is still very angry about houston's illegal scheme to steal the signs of opposing catchers using trashcan bangs just like you and me, scott. this scheme was in full bloom during the astros championship winning season in 2017.
this apology tour, as you call it, on the first day of spring training two days ago - you know, it just made a lot of people angrier. the players and officials did say sorry. but they really didn't seem to have their heart in it. for the most part, players didn't talk details of what they did, why they did it, why they didn't do anything to stop it, even though they knew it was wrong. and there was no real acknowledgement of the other teams and players they hurt by doing this.
simon: major league commissioner rob manfred, i guess, is going to talk tomorrow. you're, of course - you're in florida for spring training, right?
simon: should - (laughter) the epicenter of spring training. i'm going - he's got to worry about fans trusting the game. and does he also have to worry about houston batters getting routinely plunked this season?
goldman: yeah, because pitchers have been talking about that. you know, i don't think he was anticipating what he's going to get tomorrow, but - because things certainly have turned since thursday. he's heard the weak apologies. he's heard houston owner jim crane dig himself a hole with this comment that he didn't think the sign-stealing had an impact and then, a minute later, saying, he didn't say that. now, manfred will be asked about all this, whether he'll consider imposing any sanctions on houston players who he absolved in last month's report on the scandal. and yes. what will he say to convince fans they can trust what they're seeing on ball fields? and what will he say about this threat of opposing pitchers seeking retribution? - tough word there - retribution...
goldman: ...by throwing at houston batters this season. some pitchers are saying, yeah, they'll consider that.
simon: yeah. new rule in women's tennis goes into effect monday - coaching during matches. we remember serena williams at the - what is it? - 2018 u.s. open - penalized for taking a hand signal from her coach to move up a little closer towards the net. from now on, that'll be ok. remind us why it was ever banned.
goldman: oh, because tennis is a tradition-bound sport - and tradition says tennis is a one-on-one contest. and players should be able to figure things out and make decisions on their own without coaches helping. twelve years ago, the women's tour did start allowing coaches to visit players on court once every set. but now, as you mention, this new rule change will allow for the small moments of coaching from the stands, hand signals, etc. and a lot of people say this is good. it'll make matches more interesting for fans to be able to watch the - you know, the subtle player-coach interactions. for traditionalists who don't like this, the great billie jean king, who supports the rule changes, says, you know, players don't have to listen to the coach. they're still in control and make their own decisions. so it won't be cataclysmic what happens out there.
simon: i love billie jean king. npr's tom goldman, thanks so much.

how the trump administration's tariffs on china have affected american companies
npr's ari shapiro talks with bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda about some of the big picture impacts as american industries have tried to adjust to the trump's administration's tariffs with china.
american industries have spent several months adjusting their business practices to deal with these tariffs, and numbers are just starting to come in that show us the real impact of the trade war on u.s. companies. bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda has been following this and joins us now. thanks for coming into the studio.
andrew mayeda: thanks for having me.
shapiro: there are a lot of factors that go into a company's bottom line. so how much can you actually tell right now about what these tariffs are doing to american companies?
mayeda: i think there's no question that it's having an impact. we are starting to see companies report the effect on their earnings. a big one was apple. they said that they're selling less iphones in china. caterpillar said that this was having an impact. this is a company that makes construction equipment, the yellow stuff that you see at construction sites - nvidia, intel. so there's no question that this is rippling across the u.s. economy.
shapiro: so you gave a couple examples, like apple and caterpillar, of american companies that aren't selling as much in china. what about companies that use raw materials imported from china to manufacture in the united states? are we seeing issues there?
mayeda: yeah. probably the best example would be harley-davidson. recently they reported lower-than-expected results. their profit was hit by tariffs. but it's not just the china tariffs in that case. it's also global tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by the trump administration.
shapiro: when you look at the scale of the impact, is this more along the lines of an annoyance and inconvenience, or is it a real economic impact, something that could lead to slower economic growth, maybe even a recession down the line? how severe is it?
mayeda: if you actually look at the big-picture forecasts of the impact - for example, the imf says that if we have a worst-case trade scenario, the global economy is going to be less than 1 percent smaller than what it otherwise would've been. that is not catastrophic. i think what people are concerned about is that there's some type of confidence shock. that is to say that, you know, businesses start investing less. consumers start spending less. and it gets into this negative feedback loop where reducing confidence leads to slower growth.
and you're right. we are in about the 10th year of a global expansion. we're nearing the end of the economic cycle. investors are on edge. i mean, the music will end at some point, and we will have a recession. and if we have a serious, bruising trade war, that will not be good for the global economy.
shapiro: is this affecting small businesses in a similar way to the giants - you know, the apple, caterpillar, harleys of the world?
mayeda: yeah, absolutely. there are companies in the u.s. that are on the edge right now. big companies like apple, like caterpillar - they can shift their supply chains. they can move their supply chain from china to malaysia or vietnam. a smaller company doesn't have that flexibility, right? so if their input costs are rising, things can get very bad very quickly for some of these companies.
shapiro: can you give us an example of one of those small businesses that's really feeling this?
mayeda: well, we talked to a company that makes weather stations. so these are stations that people set up in their backyard. and this company is trying to decide how it can get around these tariffs. they can't just move their supply chain around asia. this ceo that we talked to is actually considering potentially moving production to mexico. so that's the exact opposite thing that president trump wants.
shapiro: are you seeing a pattern in the way that companies are adapting to this?
mayeda: i think that they're kind of running through a menu of options. one of the options, as i mentioned, is to move your supply chain to a place like malaysia or vietnam. there's no question that that is happening. some companies are actually engaged in what's called tariff engineering. so if i have a certain good that is hit by tariffs, as it stands now, i could slightly change the way that the good is manufactured so it is actually not covered by tariffs. and there's no question, as the president is actually hoping for, that some companies are reshoring to the united states.
shapiro: we're talking about tariffs that have been in place for several months. but if the u.s. and china don't reach a deal, tariffs are scheduled to rise even more on march 1. what are companies saying they'll do then?
mayeda: yeah, i think that if there is no deal to end the trade war, then i think that, you know, we're just going to see kind of this ongoing grind of hitting bottom lines. we're going to see, i think, probably the stock market take a hit. i think that if there is a total collapse of talks, if we were to see liu he walk out of the white house today in a storm...
mayeda: yes, that's right, yeah. that would not be a good scenario, and i would expect stocks to sell off quite sharply from that.
shapiro: that's bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda, who covers global economics. thanks so much.

'the first conspiracy' details foiled hickey plot to assassinate george washington
the first conspiracy the secret plot to kill george washington by brad meltzer and josh mensch hardcover, 413 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?
in 1776, the governor of new york and the mayor of new york city conspired to assassinate george washington. and it might have succeeded if it weren't for a would-be counterfeiter and an iron mill foreman.
it sounds like the plot of a mildly implausible historical thriller, but it actually happened and it's one of the more remarkable stories to come out of the american revolution, even if it's not one you learned in history class.
the bizarre plot is the subject of the first conspiracy, the fascinating new history book from thriller author brad meltzer and television documentary producer josh mensch. it's an intriguing look at the so-called hickey plot, the foiled conspiracy that, had it succeeded, might have killed the american dream before it even began.
the book takes place in 1776, during the first months of the revolutionary war. independence from great britain was far from a fait accompli in those days; indeed, it was considered the longest of shots — the british armed forces were some of the most powerful in the world, while the american army, populated by untrained neophytes, hayseeds, and former criminals, was very much not.
the colonies' best shot at independence relied on the military prowess of george washington, whom the continental congress named commander in chief of the young, ragtag military in 1775. washington shocked the world when his army took boston in 1776, after which the war moved to new york, which was seen as a british stronghold with a large number of loyalists.
the rebels were always doomed in the city, but the governor of new york, william tryon, and new york city mayor david mathews, both tories, didn't want to take any chances. tryon hatched a plot to either kidnap or assassinate (the goal, meltzer and mensch acknowledge, was vague) washington, thereby demoralizing the already disheartened americans. it was, the authors, write, a clandestine plan to strike a knife into the heart of the rebellion.
it also wasn't a particularly good one. despite recruiting some of washington's life guards — soldiers who were responsible for personally protecting the general — it was foiled thanks to its participants' inability to keep a secret. two of the guards, jailed for possessing counterfeit money, spilled the plot to a cellmate, who had been arrested in a separate counterfeiting scheme. and an iron mill foreman, sent by his boss to track down some awol workers who were also in on the conspiracy, uncovered more details about the plan after pretending to be a british loyalist.
the assassination never happened, of course, and one of washington's guards, thomas hickey, ended up being hanged for his role in the conspiracy. it left a legacy of a different kind, however; as meltzer and mensch write:
the discovery of this plot, and the effort to investigate it, led colonial authorities to devise new systems of intelligence gathering and counterespionage. in many ways, this strange plot against george washington would lead to the establishment of a whole new field of american spy craft — now known as counterintelligence.
it's a fascinating story, and meltzer and mensch do an excellent job explaining it. meltzer is the author of a dozen thrillers, and he brings a propulsive energy to the narrative — it can be difficult to create tension and suspense in a nonfiction book where the reader already knows how the story ends, but the authors do a great job keeping the reader turning the pages.
the book is also extremely well-researched. meltzer and mensch cite an impressive number of primary sources, including letters from washington and others, as well as a heroic number of history books. nothing about the book is phoned in; the amount of research behind it is genuinely remarkable.
if there's one thing that doesn't quite succeed, it's meltzer and mensch's prose, which at times tends toward the breathless. writing about tryon, for example, the authors declare, he has money. he knows the city as well as anyone. he has friends in high places ... and low places. and on the declaration of independence, they write, in a few days, the congress will vote whether to ratify this document — and potentially change the war ... and the world ... forever. these kind of sentences, which always come at the end of their chapters, sound like a narrator of a television series dramatically teasing the next segment of the show right before a commercial break.
but that's a minor complaint — it's easy to overlook the occasional histrionic writing when the story is so fascinating. and you certainly can't accuse meltzer and mensch of being bloodless or boring. the first conspiracy is an excellent book, enthralling and beyond fascinating, and it's sure to delight both fans of thrillers and american history.
trump, pompeo, esper defend killing of soleimani; iranians vow revenge
enlarge this image toggle caption dpa picture-alliance via getty images dpa picture-alliance via getty images
president trump and his top deputies offered a full-throated defense on tuesday of the american strike against iran's top foreign legion commander, stressing what they called the urgent danger of an attack he had been plotting.
the killing of quds force commander qassem soleimani last week has ratcheted up tensions between tehran and washington, prompting vows of retaliatory strikes.
defense secretary mark esper said tuesday that the attack soleimani was planning against americans or u.s. installations was a matter of days away, although there were few details about who, what, how and precisely when.
but the defense secretary, his colleagues and the president all said they believed they had done their duty to protect americans and now iran has an opening to step back from violence and opt for a return to the negotiating table.
we are prepared to have this discussion with them, but we are just as prepared to deliver a forceful response, esper said in a news conference at the pentagon.
the defense department is sending thousands more troops to the middle east as well as air force bombers and naval warships. american installations across the region have been placed on high alert and normal operations — including against the islamic state — have been paused. americans have been urged to leave iraq.
all the same, and notwithstanding calls within iraq for american forces to leave and vows by iran for revenge, trump and administration leaders made clear they're standing by their decision to kill soleimani.
it was the right decision. we got it right, pompeo told reporters during a briefing at the state department. he added that the strike fit perfectly within our strategy in how to counter the threat of malign activity from iran more broadly.
a step back from sensitive targets
the biggest change in tune on tuesday was over the prospective reaction by american forces to the response that iran has vowed.
trump had threatened to attack 52 sites inside iran, including religiously or culturally significant ones, as a way to try to constrain iranian retaliation.
trump and some supporters don't only want american forces to defend, for example, an embassy against an attack. they also want the united states to respond to an attack on an embassy farther afield in the middle east with a strike deep inside iran, either against a culturally important target or infrastructure such as an oil refinery.
but pompeo and esper both responded to questions about that on tuesday by stating that american forces would obey the laws of armed conflict, which preclude that kind of targeting.
every target that's being reviewed, every effort that's being made, will always be conducted inside the international laws of war, pompeo said.
esper, for his part, said, i'm fully confident ... the commander-in-chief is not going to give us an illegal order.
trump tried to take a similar line with reporters at the white house but still make it clear that he is prepared to attack targets inside the islamic republic.
if that's what the law is, i like to obey the law, trump said. but think of it: they kill our people, they blow up our people, and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions. but i'm ok with it. it's ok with me. i will say this: if iran does anything that they shouldn't be doing, they're going to be suffering the consequences and very strongly.
as npr reported on monday, the u.s. cannot legally target cultural sites, according to the hague convention the country signed in 1954, which mandates refraining from any act of hostility directed against cultural property.
strategic vision for the middle east
trump also sought to square what he calls his careerlong opposition to american operations in the middle east with his current orders to deepen the u.s. military presence in the region — and his threats to sanction iraq if it tries to eject american forces.
the united states should get out of iraq, he argued, but not now and not like this.
at some point we want to get out, he said. but this isn't the right point. the other thing is, if we do get out, we've spent a tremendous amount of money on building airports and building one of the largest embassies we have in the world. and we want to be reimbursed to the various costs that we have had. they're very significant ... we don't want to be there forever.
the president emphasized how important iraq is as a platform from which the united states can combat iran.
if baghdad tries to force out american troops now, trump said, i think it's the worst thing that can happen to iraq. if we leave, that would mean that iran would have a much bigger foothold, and the people in iraq do not want to see iran running the country.
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif told npr in an interview tuesday that the u.s. will pay for the assassination of soleimani as well as iraqi militia commander abu mahdi al-muhandis. zarif called the drone strike an act of both terrorism and war.
in that same interview, zarif told npr's mary louise kelly in tehran that the u.s. failed to issue him a visa so he could attend a gathering of the u.n. security council in new york.
pompeo was asked about that during his remarks but said he would not comment on visa matters. the secretary of state did seek to pour cold water on zarif's claim that at the time of his death, soleimani was traveling to baghdad on a diplomatic mission.
anybody here believe that? pompeo asked sarcastically.
zarif is a propagandist of the first order, he added. it's not new, we've heard these same lies before. it's fundamentally false.
members of congress are slated to get closed-door briefing on iran from top administration officials on wednesday.
pompeo is expected to be joined by cia director gina haspel and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley. the session comes as house democrats are mulling ways to limit the president's authority to order military action in iran unilaterally.
at tuesday's briefing, pompeo was also asked about his decision to stay on as secretary of state instead of leaving his post, as he was widely expected to, in order to pursue an open senate seat in kansas.
no real news there. i've said that i'm going to stay serving as secretary of state so long as president trump shall have me, pompeo said.
he added: you can accuse me of being inconsistent elsewise, but not on that one.
ammon bundy and 7 other militants arrested; 1 killed near oregon refuge

ammon bundy, leader of the group of militants that has occupied a federal wildlife refuge in oregon for weeks, has been arrested along with seven other members of the group, including his brother, ryan, according to federal and local law enforcement agencies.
in the wake of the arrests, police sharply boosted their presence around the malheur national wildlife refuge near burns, ore. at least 10 people are still believed to be occupying federal property, john sepulvado of oregon public broadcasting tells npr's morning edition.
wednesday morning, the fbi and oregon state police announced that they have now created a containment area around the refuge.
seven of the arrests took place in oregon; one man was arrested in arizona.
ammon bundy and 7 other militants arrested; 1 killed near oregon refuge listen · 4:46 4:46
the fbi and oregon state police initially arrested bundy and four other leaders of his group in an operation that began at 4:25 p.m. local time. in that operation, a member of bundy's group — who has now been identified by multiple news outlets as robert lavoy finicum — was shot and killed. another suspect was wounded and was arrested after being taken to a hospital for treatment.
those five arrests came as the militants were traveling to a planned meeting with community members — a drive of more than an hour and a half, sepulvado reports. they encountered a traffic stop at which bundy and others were taken into custody.
his lieutenants in this were also either picked up or they fled, sepulvado says.
hours later, authorities made three more arrests: two in oregon and another in peoria, ariz.
reporting early wednesday morning from the roadside near the refuge, sepulvado says he's seeing convoys of federal trucks, armored trucks, and a lot of police cars behind them, zooming to the refuge on different roads.
that's a change from recent weeks, he says, adding that the police vehicles were closely trailed by news vans.

one of the militants still inside the refuge headquarters spoke to oregon public broadcasting, confirming that finicum was dead.
lavoy was killed, i can't turn my back on that, said militant david fry. everybody's on alert for obvious reasons.
the fbi says all of the people who were arrested face a federal felony charge of conspiracy to impede officers of the united states from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation, or threats.
all of them are also from states other than oregon. here's the list of those arrested, from the fbi:
ammon edward bundy, age 40, of emmett, idaho
ryan c. bundy, age 43, of bunkerville, nev.
brian cavalier, age 44, of bunkerville, nev.
shawna cox, age 59, kanab, utah
ryan waylen payne, age 32, of anaconda, mont.
joseph donald o'shaughnessy, age 45, of cottonwood, ariz.
peter santilli, age 50, of cincinnati, ohio
bundy's group has been occupying the malheur national wildlife refuge near burns, ore., since early this month as part of an ongoing dispute between ranchers and the federal bureau of land management.
market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements
today president trump is at the g-7 summit and high on the agenda is climate change. many world leaders are imploring trump stay in the global climate agreement, but emissions are going down already.
throughout president trump's overseas trip this week, he's been getting an earful about climate and how important the paris climate agreement is. many foreign leaders say the u.s. should not abandon it, and president trump tweeted this morning that he will make a final decision next week. but as npr's christopher joyce reports, staying in or out of that paris deal may not make that much difference.
christopher joyce, byline: pope francis told president trump to stick with the paris agreement, so did france's newly elected president, emmanuel macron. the agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. trump says it's a bad deal for the u.s. economy. nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. but climate experts point out that emissions in the u.s. are already going down without the paris deal.
kate larsen: the u.s. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve. and we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of trump policy.
joyce: that's kate larsen with the rhodium group, which does research on climate economics. emissions in the u.s. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005. a new study by rhodium says that decline is likely to continue.
larsen: with current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what president trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.
joyce: larsen and other energy economists say a big part of that is due to decisions made by companies, especially those that make electricity.
larsen: a lot of that is switching from coal to gas in the power sector and now increasingly from coal to gas to renewables. and that's a trend that we don't see stopping anywhere in the near future.
joyce: in effect, larsen says, what happens over the next few years has already been set in motion. the picture beyond 2020, though, gets cloudy. by then, whatever the trump administration does to dismantle climate regulations would have kicked in. economist marc hafstead says that if the economy grows faster as well, the downward emissions trend could stall by 2025.
marc hafstead: and my analysis was, under the best-case scenario, we'd come in somewhere around 10.
joyce: a 10 percent drop in emissions. president obama promised to cut emissions well over twice that under the paris agreement. in the end, though, the decision about staying in or leaving the paris agreement is not just about hitting numerical targets. hafstead, who's with resources for the future, says what the u.s. does sends a message to the rest of the world.
hafstead: exiting paris could potentially have political ramifications to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.
joyce: which could have far greater consequences for global warming than how far off the climate mark the u.s. ends up.

first woman to wear a boston bib races again, 50 years later
enlarge this image toggle caption paul connell/boston globe via getty images paul connell/boston globe via getty images
kathrine switzer, the first woman to officially enter the boston marathon, returned to the course 50 years after she made history — finishing in 2017 with a time of 4:44:31.
when switzer ran in 1967, she was 20, and entered as k.v. switzer — so none of the race organizers would know she was a woman. when she was discovered, after the marathon had already started, the race director tried to rip her bib numbers off her back.
switzer finished anyway, and came back eight more times. in her later races, no subterfuge was necessary. and in 2017 switzer, now 70, was cheered, not met with rage.
at the point where she was once confronted by that race official, she posted a facebook live video — smiling as she ran, with her bib number, 261, pinned safely in place.
before the race, switzer spoke with npr about the day she made history.
she noted that a woman had already run the course once — without entering. bobbi gibb hid in the bushes by the starting line and snuck into the mass of runners as they passed, finishing in 3:21:40.
still, despite proof that women could clearly complete marathons, the athletic world generally assumed that women couldn't run and didn't want to run that far, switzer says.
the longest distance women were allowed to run in the olympics at that time was 800 meters.
it was feared that anything longer was going to injure women, that they wouldn't be able to have children or they somehow turned into men, she told npr.
'you'll never have children,' they said. 'you're going to get big legs. you're going to grow hair on your chest.' it was hilarious, the myths.
and, of course, when people hear myths, they believe them — because to try otherwise might mean damaging yourself. so people were afraid and they just went about their lives that way and restricted themselves.
switzer's coach in 1967 was a 15-time boston marathoner and didn't think a woman could do it — which energized switzer to try. (she changed his mind as she was training for the race, when she ran 31 miles during one session, sb nation reports.)
so she entered the marathon, following all the proper procedures and just, well, neglecting to mention she was female.
switzer told npr's lulu garcia-navarro what happened when she was discovered:
at about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that i was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. and alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. and the race director [jock semple] was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. and he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, 'get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.' and i was just blindsided by this. i was terrified. i was scared. and my boyfriend came along with a full streak and gave the official a cross-body block and sent him out of the race instead. you know, we laugh about it now because it's so funny when a girl is saved by her burly boyfriend. but ... i said to my coach immediately after the incident: 'i have to finish this race now because if i drop out of this race, nobody's going to believe that women are serious.'
switzer finished the race in four hours and twenty minutes.
as the years went on she advocated for women to be admitted as full competitors — and kept running more and more marathons. she won the new york city marathon in 1974. and she competed in boston several more times, placing second in the women's race in 1975 with a time of 2:51, her personal best.
switzer said her return to the race in 2017 was a way to, celebrate the fact, first of all, that i can run — that i'm capable of doing it, amazingly enough, and i'm very, very grateful for that.
and i'm also very grateful for the opportunity to thank a city and the streets that changed my life, she said, and help to empower millions of women all around the world and change the face of the sport.
one type of business that's thriving during coronavirus? locally owned grocery stores
while many small business owners across the d.c. region are seeing their profits flatline, the owners of small food markets and grocery store chains are experiencing a boom in business.
we're trying to feed the world, and everyone else is trying to figure out how to survive, says scott nash, the owner of the mom's organic market grocery stores that dot the washington region.
[read the latest updates about coronavirus in our region here]
business has doubled at all mom's locations over the past five days. nash says the increase is due to restaurants in d.c., maryland, and other states shutting down to slow the spread of coronavirus, and chain grocery stores' struggles with empty shelves and massive lines.
smaller chains like mom's can be more nimble, nash believes. as customer demand increases, he has been able to call up his suppliers — my meat guys, my chicken guys, my produce guys — to arrange extra deliveries and keep his shelves relatively full. he's also started texting his larger suppliers, urging them to put ads on craigslist for temporary truck drivers and pallet stackers, so they can deliver more products.
best world supermarket in mt. pleasant is experiencing a similar boom. owner in suk pak says his largely latino clientele has been stocking up on maseca (a brand of corn flour) water, rice, and sanitary products. and a few blocks down, staff at each peach market say they've been selling staples (milk, eggs and bread) and pre-made foods (soups and dips) as soon as they shelve them.
but because each peach partners with individual farmers rather than larger suppliers, it can't order more product at the drop of a hat. we're calling up, like, tim, the guy who brings us our eggs and saying to him, 'can you bring us twice as many eggs as you normally do?' says eleanor gease, the store's general manager.
tim, a farmer in central pennsylvania, can't ramp up his delivery schedule even if he has the eggs supply available.
for many local grocers, the biggest shortage is labor, not product.
staff are exhibiting signs of stress, says eleanor gease, each peach's general manager. they're interacting with hundreds of people a day.
at mom's, nash has increased overtime pay to incentivize employees to work more hours. he's also been trying to hire temporary workers. every store could use 15 more employees today, he says. he's hoping to be able to hire restaurant workers who don't have shifts to take now that restaurants and bars have been shut down.
a few blocks away from each peach, employees at el progreso market were too busy to find the manager for an interview. lines to check out stretched down the already-tight aisles to the deli section in the back, where a butcher was hurriedly wrapping meat for customers.
manager? i don't know, i'm just trying to deliver bread, one frazzled man said as he stacked loaves of white bread onto a shelf.
at best world, pak has had to turn away from his managerial duties in order to help stock shelves. he's also become the store's tech guy, figuring out how to fix glitches in the checkout machine software because he doesn't have time to call for support. meanwhile, his wife is jumping on a cash register to help with the growing lines between a failed bank run (the bank was closed) and a product delivery.
pak isn't too worried about running out of steam. he sees this as a short-term situation rather than a boom that will change his small business forever.
it's busy, he says, but someday it's going to slow down. busy means nothing to us.
leaders of the nation's large grocery store chains say they are stocking up to meet demand and are increasing their sanitization practices to keep people safe. still, worries over being in the vicinity of hundreds of other shoppers had led some customers to return to their community stores where the crowds are smaller.
i heard from a customer, 'i don't want to go to safeway,' said jeanlouise conaway, the owner of each peach. she says their loyal local customers trust her staff to prioritize health and safety over profits.
due to the small size of her business, conaway has been able to institute new practices like curbside grocery pickup and limiting the number of shoppers inside to eight at a time.
nash says he's doing his best to keep his mom's stores clean, but acknowledges that there's a limit to how much he can control. all you can do is, don't touch your face and wash your hands and stay a few feet from everybody. you can sanitize all you want... he trails off.
we really ought to be grateful as hell that we're in this industry he picks back up after a beat. our problems are good problems. our jobs aren't threatened, at least not yet.
'the dispatcher' is a short stroll in a strange neighborhood
the dispatcher by john scalzi hardcover, 130 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?
john scalzi's newest book, the dispatcher, is a strange one.
and i don't mean the book itself, though it has its own streak of oddity alive in its pages. i mean the book as metaphysical object — book as book, as story and voice and concept and conceit. it's strange because, for starters, it's a backwards kind of book, done first for audible, the audio book people, and therefore written with an ear toward performance. it is a physical book only as an afterthought, arriving on the shelves months after it appeared on people's phones.
it's strange because it is a novella — that most hybrid of forms, weightier than the drive-by punch of a short story, lighter than a novel with all its baggage — given the treatment usually reserved for longer works.
and it's strange because it's scalzi walking around in a sub-genre that's not his usual neighborhood. he does space opera, mostly. military spec-fic. dabbles in the near-future. but the dispatcher is, for lack of a more artful term, hard urban fantasy (hurfancy?) and, just to tweak it a little further, it's got secondary sub-sub-genre genes as well, with the outward characteristics (rain, crisp dialog, a missing person, cop-and-consultant dialectics) of a gumshoe detective story.
so here's the spine of the thing: in the very near future (like tomorrow-near) it suddenly comes to pass that anyone who is murdered comes back to life a second later, arriving naked, and generally rather confused, back at home in their own bed. it's a miracle. spooky. begging many deep and philosophical questions about the nature of existence and the existence of god.
scalzi is a man with a fertile and weird imagination. a writer who makes his nickels by always asking, okay, but what else might happen?'
but it's also, you know, just a thing. because murders? there are a lot of them. and very quickly this completely unexplained phenomenon becomes a simple fact of daily existence. die of natural causes, you're done. lights out and goodbye. but if you're murdered? 999 times out of 1,000, you vanish with a pop and show up back at home in your birthday suit, reset to a few hours before your untimely demise.
the story follows tony valdez, a dispatcher who works operating rooms and ers murdering patients who are beyond medical help. because if they die on the operating table, they're just dead, right? but if tony is there to put a bullet in their brain just before they die, bingo! second chance. he saves lives by murdering the very-nearly-dead, resetting them to give the doctors a second chance.
it's all very official in scalzi's world. tony went to school for this — he's a government employee, works with the insurance companies, does a lot of paperwork. but then one day a friend of his, another dispatcher who may or may not be involved in some shady side-gigs, goes missing, and we're off to the races. there's a police officer, lots of conversations at hot dog stands and greek diners, the questioning of a grieving spouse (with whom tony has a history), and some dealings with rich men and mobsters. like i said, hurfancy with a side of gumshoe. and that is amusing, at least for a bit.
but scalzi is a man with a fertile and weird imagination. a writer who makes his nickels by always asking, okay, but what else might happen? and with the dispatcher, the most interesting ideas come as asides, hints, hypotheticals. if murder victims come back but the naturally dead do not, what else might happen? what might certain ... less than scrupulous people do if they knew that almost every single murdered person will come back, right as rain?
they might stage deadly, underground, hammer-on-baseball-bat gladiator fights with a trained dispatcher standing by to cap every single participant when it's done. rich folks might have a fella like tony standing by when they do things like go skydiving (just in case) or stage dangerous movie stunts (just in case). dueling might come back into fashion. with broadswords. because why not? when death by murder is no longer deadly, the possibilities are both dark and endless — which is ideal scalzi territory.
so yes, the dispatcher is thin. a quick romp to a strange zip code. the audiobook-first timing means that, as a book-book, it reads a little bit like a play — first-person, light on the scene-setting and long on dialog — but seeing scalzi work under these restrictions is kinda fun. the voice doesn't sound like exactly what you expect if you're a fan, but the brain running the show is obviously the same. and while the bench of characters is shallow and the main story feels a little bit rushed (because, you know, novella), it's the odd detours that make the book worthwhile. it's imagining a world where murder can be life-saving, where certain kinds of death get you a pass from the reaper, and how a little thing like that might change ... everything.

trump's travel costs add up, setting him on path to outspend obama
enlarge this image toggle caption joe raedle/getty images joe raedle/getty images
ordinary folks can fly from the washington, d.c., area to southeast florida for $200-300 round-trip, if they book in advance. for the president, the trip is a little more costly.
exactly how much is not currently public, though. the conservative group judicial watch, which has been tracking the cost of presidential travel for several years, estimates that president trump's frequent visits to his palm beach resort mar-a-lago probably cost the government around $1 million each.
much of the expense stems from air force one 747, which costs around $140,000 per flying hour right now, says judicial watch's president, tom fitton. the trips typically incur other expenses as well, such as lodging and travel expenses for the secret service, and reimbursements for local police.
it's a snapshot cost, in the sense that there are other costs obviously involved that we could get, but the government just doesn't want to give it to us or they keep secret for some reason, fitton says.
the government accountability office has agreed to look into the costs and security concerns raised by democratic lawmakers about the florida trips.
trump has so far appeared to set a record for weekend travel, regularly shuttling back and forth between washington and florida.
for someone who complained about president obama traveling a lot, he's going to supersede president obama's travel, all eight years [of it], within a year, which is just absolutely ridiculous, says democratic rep. ruben gallego of arizona, who recently signed a letter to the pentagon asking about the costs racked up by the president's use of air force one.
political hay has long been made over personal travel by presidents. republicans regularly excoriated obama for the cost of his trips to hawaii and africa, for example.
republican sen. john barrasso of wyoming asked the government accountability office to look into the cost of a three-day, three-legged trip obama took from washington to chicago and then onto palm beach in february 2013. the report calculated the cost of the trip at around $3.6 million.
in fact, judicial watch began monitoring travel costs during the obama administration.
he made a big show of taking his wife up to new york on a date night. and i thought to myself, 'well, that sounds like a pretty darned expensive date night,' knowing what it costs to move a president around, fitton says. because the obamas and their entourage flew on small planes, the cost of that trip was relatively low. press reports put it at around $25,000.
the obama administration was reluctant to answer questions about travel costs, forcing judicial watch to file freedom of information requests to get an answer (secret service documents show $11,648.17 in security expenses for that trip). so far, the trump white house hasn't been much more transparent, fitton says.
there has to be an awareness that it costs money to go down there, and they should justify the cost or explain to the american people why it's necessary, he says.
a million dollars for a weekend trip to florida is actually chump change for the pentagon, with its annual budget of $600 billion, but gallego says that isn't really the point.
we've had to stop hiring child care specialists in child care day centers on army bases because the president has done a hiring freeze, he says. if the president wants to ask the country to sacrifice and other government agencies to sacrifice, then he should be doing the same.
putting a roof on risk with a covid-19 vaccine jab
it's 8:45 a.m. on a weekday in washington, d.c., and if anyone needs a reminder why the coronavirus vaccine is important, there's one arriving at the takoma metro stop: an almost empty train pulling up to an almost empty subway platform at the height of rush hour.
one year ago the world health organization held its first news conference on a new coronavirus emerging from wuhan, china. incredibly, i'm on my way to mark that anniversary by joining some six million americans who have already been vaccinated.
as i board the train, there are five other passengers on a car with 62 seats. i take my place as far from each of the others as i can — much as they must have when they boarded — reminded of the importance of social distancing by a metallic voice emanating from overhead speakers: facial coverings are required at all times while riding metrorail and metrobus. everyone is, indeed, masked.
i'm traveling across town to a location that's dispensing covid-19 shots two-trains-and-a-bus-ride away from my home: the washington senior wellness center. when i logged onto the district's vaccination website to make my appointment in the first hour that doing so was possible, the two dozen closer locations already had no reservations left. this is the first time people over 65 are eligible, and by day's end, all available slots had been snapped up, all across the district.
so i'm lucky. as are the 17 people lined up before me when the center opens at 10 a.m. — opens being a relative term, since we're still lined up outside on this brisk january morning. until your appointment time is just a couple of minutes away, you stay outside.
inside, things are bright and socially distanced. the pharmacists are dispensing the moderna vaccine (which does not have to be kept insanely cold), and the process at this center is so efficient it seems almost anticlimactic: a form to sign, a pinprick, and about 90 seconds after i enter the room, i get a sticker saying vaccinated. sort of an adult lollipop to take home.
i'm told to come back in four weeks for a booster shot that will make me as protected as i'll ever be. and that, i guess, is that.
it all reminded me of a friend's observation that the most important home renovation he'd ever done, replacing his roof, was also the least satisfying. before he did it, he had a roof. after he did it, he'd spent $30,000, and he had a roof.
this feels a little like that. i have not gotten sick with the coronavirus. and now that i've gotten the first of my two shots, the chances that i'll get sick are much diminished. that's good, because i'm old enough to be at heightened risk of dying.
but society is still at risk, so it won't change the fact that i'll need to wear masks, stay six feet away from people, and avoid crowds until most of the public has been vaccinated, too.
it's enormously important, this protective roof i've put on my own risk. a miracle provided by medical professionals to whom i am profoundly grateful for putting me back where we all started.
amy schumer deftly challenges beauty standards in 'i feel pretty'
a woman with low self-esteem hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. critic david edelstein says i feel pretty suggests the notion of what's pretty should be elasticized.
this is fresh air. the comedian amy schumer became a movie star with her 2015 comedy trainwreck, which she co-wrote. her third big screen comic vehicle, i feel pretty, opens today preceded by some noteworthy negative publicity. film critic david edelstein explains.
david edelstein, byline: the internet backlash against the amy schumer comedy i feel pretty began early, based on the trailer. and it rested on the idea that the movie is about how an ugly woman becomes beautiful. that's an understandable mistake but a mistake nonetheless. it's a funny, deft, in some ways conventional rom-com about a woman with painfully low self-esteem who hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. behaving as if she's the most gorgeous creature on earth might make her an object of hilarity. but her stratospheric sense of self-worth disarms everyone she meets.
schumer didn't conceive i feel pretty. it was written and directed by the team of abby kohn and marc silverstein. but it fits into her tv show inside amy schumer's history of challenging men on their caveman aesthetic and those women who feel they have no choice but to accept male definitions of beauty. along with lena dunham, schumer has been on the front lines, as twitter jackasses have argued that a woman who looks like her shouldn't even have her own show, a criticism she transformed into an ingenious parody of 12 angry men in which a jury of overentitled male dweebs debated her hotness.
her character in i feel pretty, renee bennett, stares forlornly into the mirror and attempts to compensate for not looking like a fashion model - the kind of women who walk around in micro-miniskirts at the corporate office in which she wants to work, an estee lauder-like makeup company overseen by michelle williams' blonde and beauteous avery leclaire. renee rewatches the movie big, in which a kid who longs to be a grown-up is magically transformed. and then she goes and wishes at a fountain to be, quote, undeniably pretty. it doesn't happen then. but the next day, she goes flying off the bike in spin class, bangs her head and thinks her wish came true. believing she's a guy magnet, renee banters at her dry cleaners with an unassuming bearded man played by rory scovel.
(soundbite of film, i feel pretty)
amy schumer: (as renee bennett) you probably haven't been here before, but you have to wait in line and take a number.
rory scovel: (as ethan) oh, all right.
schumer: (as renee bennett) i can grab it for you, yeah.
scovel: (as ethan) oh, thank you.
schumer: (as renee bennett) i just - here.
schumer: (as renee bennett) and this guy just calls out, like, the number completely out of sequence.
schumer: (as renee bennett) it's like a weird game of bingo.
schumer: (as renee bennett) but no one wins. so yeah.
scovel: (as ethan) what's your number?
schumer: (as renee bennett) so this is how it happens, just like that. wow.
scovel: (as ethan) just like what happens? like what?
schumer: (as renee bennett) that is very clever.
scovel: (as ethan) i don't know why that's clever. what is clever? i was just asking...
schumer: (as renee bennett) what's your number? and then i go, oh, 118. and then you're like, no, your phone number.
schumer: (as renee bennett) yeah. you are good. how long have you been hanging onto that little nugget?
scovel: (as ethan) i haven't. i haven't been holding onto that. that's not a nugget at all.
schumer: (as renee bennett) you don't hang out in a lot of dry cleaners and hit on perfect girls? that's - wow. all right. give me your phone.
schumer: (as renee bennett) give me your phone. i'm going to give you my number.
scovel: (as ethan) are you still talking to me?
schumer: (as renee bennett) don't chicken out now.
scovel: (as ethan) i'm not chickening out.
edelstein: that scene's loose, overlapping dialogue as two characters on different wavelengths do and don't connect is one of the movie's glories. rory scovel stays in the film and proves an inspired straight man for amy schumer's renee, a social outcast with little romantic experience who comes to see her as a life force. you can go with or shrug off such rom com contrivances, though co-directors abby kohn and marc silverstein are masters of them, having written the wonderful never been kissed with drew barrymore.
i feel pretty is by leagues schumer's best film. her motormouth delivery has a high-wire quality, as if she's babbling for her life. and her pratfalls have a ballerina's precision, probably enhanced by the editor, tia nolan. when renee spontaneously enters a coney island bikini contest, the scene could be squirm-inducing. but instead, it's exhilarating because renee is at home in her body. as the shellacked and baby-voiced mogul avery leclaire, michelle williams has a lyrical melancholy. she's a smart, educated woman who feels as trapped in her body as schumer's renee does in hers and stuck with a voice she's unable to change.
the movie suggests almost no one has the appropriate level of self-esteem. i feel pretty can be criticized as too rosy on the grounds that the power of positive thinking can only get us so far. indeed, it can even reinforce the repressive social norms it claims to challenge. but renee's positive thinking has such a dizzy, life-affirming charge that she makes you believe if she's not quote, pretty, it's because the definition of pretty is inadequate. it needs to be elasticized or maybe blown to smithereens.
bianculli: david edelstein is film critic for new york magazine. on monday's show, pulitzer prize-winning poet gregory pardlo. his new memoir is called air traffic: a memoir of ambition and manhood in america. some of the things that figure into his story - his father losing his job when reagan broke the air traffic controllers union, joining the marine reserves and then wanting out, and being on a reality tv show with his family. join us.

trump's 'socialism' attack on democrats has its roots in cold war fear
enlarge this image toggle caption chris kleponis/getty images chris kleponis/getty images
there's a huge 2020 democratic field forming for the chance to take on president trump. two more candidates officially announced over the weekend – sens. amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts.
and while those two potentially embody the core split within the democratic primary – pragmatism vs. pugilism – trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: socialism vs. greatness.
the democrat party has never been more outside of the mainstream, trump said in el paso, texas, on monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.
politics state of the union is trump's first major speech in 2020 election cycle state of the union is trump's first major speech in 2020 election cycle listen · 5:03 5:03
it's a message he began trying out a week ago during his state of the union address. he tied the unrest in venezuela to domestic u.s. politics.
here in the united states, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country, he said. america was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.
the denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to democrats is trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. the president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic democrat, trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of america.
he's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said bruce mehlman, a republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the commerce department for technology policy. the resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last november. the economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. mr. mueller's report and/or democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. and voters want change.
republicans tried a version of trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. they tried to paint democrats as wanting to abolish ice (the immigration and customs enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care.
republicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. it didn't happen. instead, in an election where trump was front of mind, democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the house by flipping 40 seats.
in 2020, trump gets to try to make the argument himself. and people close to him think he can make a winning one.
at the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said andy surabian, who worked in the 2016 trump campaign war room, was political director for tea party express and is now a political adviser to donald trump jr. the biggest gift to trump is for democrats to nominate what i call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.
mehlman added: if the dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. but if they go hard left, there is a path for donald trump to get re-elected.
it is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. his potential democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in gop primaries).
enlarge this image toggle caption scott olson/getty images scott olson/getty images
already, many of the democrats running or thinking about it are embracing medicare-for-all and the green new deal. both of those ideas have been put forward by the party's two highest-profile democratic socialists — vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who caucuses with the democrats, and new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez.
this is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the democratic party rather than at the fringes. sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton. sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.
it's going to be interesting to see how democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. the word makes many americans — and some democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.
a remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), gallup found last year.
don't see the graphic? click here.
that diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of americans have a positive view of socialism. socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. since trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.
there is a huge generational divide: a majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. older americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.
this younger generation, after all, are not cold war kids. someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the iron curtain. the word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-world war ii arms race with the soviet union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.
don't see the graphic above? click here.
as viewed by americans, that debate was between the free, capitalistic west on one side and the repressive communism and socialism of the ussr on the other.
some democrats are trying to find more nuance. sen. brian schatz of hawaii, for example, sparked an interesting debate on the left with his tweet that he's not a socialist but does believe that every american deserves health care, that college should be debt free, and that america must lead boldly on climate change.
and schatz may be on to something. when younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like venezuela or cuba. to them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.
president trump is moving aggressively to define the democrats as old-fashioned, cold war-style socialists. now, it's up to the democrats to define what it is they are for.
much of the difference comes down to semantics — the wording and view of what socialism really is.
the problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries.
democratic sen. doug jones endorses former vice president joe biden
npr's david greene talks to sen. doug jones of alabama, one of 14 states voting on super tuesday, about why he thinks a ticket with bernie sanders at the helm could hurt his own reelection bid.
we turn now to alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. hillary clinton beat bernie sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. that suggests that it is joe biden's to lose. david greene talked with alabama's democratic senator, doug jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.
david greene, byline: so why is joe biden your pick?
doug jones: well, i've known joe for a long time - i mean, 40 years. i first met him as a law student here in birmingham about - gosh, it was in i think 1978. and i've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. he's the kind of leader that i think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.
greene: well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? i mean, for one, there was this story that biden told about being arrested in south africa on his way to see nelson mandela. it was largely disproven. finally, biden is saying, ok, i wasn't arrested. i was actually just held up at an airport. can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?
jones: well, you know, i can't speak for other voters. i think people that know joe for a long time are looking at his record. they're not looking at things like that, especially when we've got folks in the white house, in the administration today, who have no compunction whatsoever about saying things that are either blown out of proportion, hyper hyped or either just outright false. so i think...
greene: but does that make it - i'm sorry to interrupt. does that make it ok for joe biden to say something that's not true?
jones: well, i don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. whether it's ok or not i don't think is going to be the issue. the issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. they're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. and i think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of south carolina - they know joe biden. they know his fallacies. they know his positives. and that's why the people of south carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why i think he's going to do very well on super tuesday.
greene: but there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. i mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?
jones: look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. look at the people who've known joe biden for as long as they have. look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.
greene: so, i mean, i'm sure you're aware he faces an uphill battle going into super tuesday. i mean, he is at a huge fundraising disadvantage compared to bernie sanders right now. he's been behind in the polls in some very big states like california and texas. how does he overcome that?
jones: well, i think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. this is a delegate count number right now. this field is going to winnow down, and i think as joe biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond super tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for joe biden. this race is far from over. i think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual democratic nominee. we've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. yeah, senator sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the democrats have been throughout this season, i think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around joe biden ultimately.
greene: if sanders emerges as the front-runner and ends up leading, possibly winning, the delegate count, are you ready to get behind him?
jones: you know, look, i disagree with senator sanders on many, many things. i think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. you know, one of the things that i'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the democratic party are heard. right now, i'm having a hard time seeing that with senator sanders. but that's not to say he can't do it. we have got such a long way to go. i still believe this race is far from over. instead of playing a speculation game, i think we need to let this matter play out. i think we need to let all the elections.
greene: well, what specifically worries you about bernie sanders? you said you're worried about him bringing all the - you know, a full coalition together. what are you specifically worried about?
jones: look, i think that senator sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. but the way that they want to do things with medicare for all i just don't think is a viable option. and i'm not sure how senator sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. that's just one issue. i think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. but my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.
greene: democratic senator doug jones of the state of alabama. really appreciate talking to you, senator. thank you.
jones: always a pleasure, david. thanks so much for having me.

trump impeachment trial recap: republicans balk at mcconnell over session rules

updated at 1:57 a.m. et on wednesday
after more than 12 hours of action tuesday, the senate adopted the ground rules for the coming weeks in president trump's impeachment trial. it brought a reminder that even this highly scripted ordeal may include a few surprises after all.
senators did not agree to the first draft of rules proposed by majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., notwithstanding his party's control of the chamber and his reputation as a savvy counter of votes.
he had repeatedly insisted that the rules for the trial would be modeled on those for the 1999 impeachment trial of president bill clinton.
mcconnell also said confidently last week that all the members of the gop conference backed his approach to have the prosecution and defense lay out their arguments and address written questions before turning to the issue of whether to subpoena witnesses or documents.
when members of his own conference reviewed the details of his resolution, mcconnell was forced to do something he doesn't have to do often — change his plan under pressure from fellow republicans.
his draft resolution stated that each side would present its case in up to 24 hours over two days. his last-minute revision expanded that timing to three days. he also allowed evidence from the house to be automatically entered into the record unless there were an objection.
but while mcconnell may have been forced to revise his plans for the overall structure for the trial rules, he was able to stave off several attempts by senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., later in the day and late into the night on tuesday. republicans voted down 11 amendments, mostly to subpoena documents from the white house, state department and other administration officials. they stuck with mcconnell's argument that the issue about witnesses and documents would be addressed after both sides made their case for and against impeachment.

collins leads rebels in balking at rules
mcconnell is frequently lauded for his political acumen and ability to see around legislative corners. he held firm as house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., demanded he set up a fair trial before she sent over the articles of impeachment. he prevailed — she was unable to extract any commitments.
the majority leader also ignored predictable calls from democrats such as schumer to allow more than two days for the impeachment managers to make their case.
but he couldn't ignore maine sen. susan collins, who was among a group of senate republicans who insisted that the time be extended.

senator collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the house transcript in the record, her office said in a statement. her position has been that the trial should follow the [bill] clinton model as much as possible. she thinks these changes are a significant improvement.
the fate of mcconnell's initial proposed rules represented a very rare defeat at the hands of his own allies and underscored the desire, at least by collins and a few others, for the senate not to appear as a partisan rubber stamp.
dems, white house spar over witnesses
on that point, at least, collins and the other rebels broadly agreed with the case made by house impeachment managers about a number of amendments to mcconnell's rules.
rep. adam schiff, d-calif., the lead manager, urged senators to adopt a number of amendments offered by schumer that would have admitted witnesses and documents into the proceedings.
trump's fate in this phase of impeachment — whether he's convicted or acquitted — will have greater value if americans believe that the president truly underwent a full and fair trial, schiff said.
and that means, he argued, that the senate must bring in former national security adviser john bolton, acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and others who schiff said would shed more light on the underlying events of the ukraine affair.
white house counsel pat cipollone urged senators to reject schumer's amendments, and he repeated republicans' long-standing criticisms of the impeachment case generally and schiff in particular.
schiff and his compatriots, including democrats zoe lofgren of california and val demings of florida, made what were effectively opening arguments against trump, structured around the evidence they said should be brought into the matter.
demings, for example, detailed the material in the possession of the state department that she said would strengthen democrats' case that trump had abused his power or conditioned his policy toward ukraine last year on the expectation that its leaders would launch investigations that trump thought would help him politically.
debate continued until nearly 2 a.m. et wednesday as schumer continually offered amendments seeking testimony or material for the trial — and mcconnell and republicans continued to bat them down. the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. et wednesday.
rep. joaquin castro on trump's border emergency declaration
let's turn now to congress and a democratic member there. he is representative joaquin castro of texas, and he joins us now on the line.
garcia-navarro: i'd like to start with venezuela. as you just heard, it's a very tense situation there in a part of the world where the u.s. doesn't have a lot of goodwill to expend. is this administration doing the right thing, in your view, in trying to directly influence venezuelan affairs?
castro: i think the administration has to be careful not to be too heavy-handed given the united states' involvement in latin america in the past. ultimately, the people of venezuela have to be able to choose who their leader is. but i think there's two things that need to happen immediately. first, we need to make sure that that humanitarian aid gets into the country because there's so many people who are starving and suffering. the second thing is that the united states congress should move right away and the president should move right away to offer temporary protected status to the people of venezuela to be able to come here to the united states at least temporarily if they need to.
garcia-navarro: what is your reaction, though, to secretary of state pompeo's tweet last night that the u.s. will take action? there is a lot of ambivalence among democrats about intervention.
castro: that's right. i hope that he doesn't mean military action. in fact, i'm on the foreign affairs committee. we just had elliott abrams, who's a special representative for venezuela, testify about a week-and-a-half ago. and he didn't give any indication that military action was imminent. that said, i think we've got to get with the lima group, with oas, with the united nations to make sure that that aid gets in and that elections are held as soon as possible.
you know, i was one of the folks that has supported sanctions against the maduro regime in the past. so you know, most folks would be fine if maduro left. i think people want change. but we also have to be careful to make sure that it's the venezuelan people who are choosing their new leader.
garcia-navarro: let's turn to something that you're sponsoring. the president declared a national emergency on the southern border over a week ago. you've introduced a resolution to terminate that declaration, which will get a vote on tuesday. does it have any chance in the senate?
castro: (laughter) well, it should pass the house of representatives. we have probably about 228 folks supporting it now, including a republican.
castro: that's right. we have justin amash of michigan. and our appeal has been very bipartisan. we've made it an issue about the fact that the president is trying to usurp the power of congress. the constitution gives congress the power of the purse. and the president asked mexico to pay for this wall; they wouldn't. congress wouldn't pay for the wall. and now he's trying to unilaterally take the money, billions of it, from military construction funds. and so in communities like mine of san antonio, which is military city, usa, that's a big problem. but you asked the question about the senate. i think that we can get three more votes that we need to pass it in the senate and then send it to the president's desk. obviously, that's going to take a lot of work.
garcia-navarro: president trump has promised to veto.
castro: yeah. no, there's no question. there's no guarantee here. it's an uphill battle. but as i said when this started, if he declares a national emergency just to build a border wall that he said mexico would pay for, we're going to fight him in congress. we're going to fight him in the courts. and i believe that a large segment of the american public will fight the president on this.
garcia-navarro: representative castro, if the president vetoes it - if it doesn't pass in the senate, it seems like this is simply an action - like, a protest vote, if you will. is relying on the courts so heavily really the way you as a democrat want to advance your ideas?
castro: well, i think that it's an approach from different angles. right? it's an approach in congress, trying to pass legislation. and then you xavier becerra and 16 other attorneys general in other states who have filed suit. so yeah, i mean, we fundamentally disagree with a president doing something that no president has ever done before, which is to call a national emergency to try to deliver on a campaign promise that he said another country was going to pay for it. nobody's ever done that before. so yes, we're going to do everything that we can in congress and in the courts. and i hope that the american people continue to speak up.
garcia-navarro: democratic representative joaquin castro of texas, thank you so much.

how i moved my cat from israel to pakistan
enlarge this image toggle caption diaa hadid/npr diaa hadid/npr
i recently hunched over my desk lunch and typed: how to get a cat from israel to pakistan.
this is not a question that google easily answers. there are no holiday packages from israel to pakistan — no direct flights, and no diplomatic relations.
but here i was, asking the internet weird questions at npr's washington, d.c., headquarters in june. i was being trained there before i was to be dispatched as their islamabad-based correspondent. most of my worldly possessions — and my cat — were in israel and the palestinian territories, where i was previously based as a mideast correspondent for the new york times.
foreign correspondents are famous for adopting cats. it's a quixotic proclivity, because of how frequently we travel. but no other correspondent i've heard of had tried something like this. and i asked all the cat-loving correspondents i could find.
finally, through the company animal airways, i reached eytan kreiner, an israeli veterinarian. i explained the pickle i was in.
don't worry. we are experts in taking animals to enemy countries, he said in a thick israeli accent. i imagined an aged mossad operative.
we just took a dog to iran, he said. we have an underground network of vets who help us. everybody is sympathetic to animals. even enemies.
kreiner said he could fly my cat from israel to a third country. they would change his papers and then fly him to pakistan. i dutifully paid $350 to start the process.
my cat shawareb — arabic for mustache — was an accidental acquisition.
in 2015, i lived in the palestinian city of ramallah in the west bank. there, one of my roommates brought him home: a stray, mewing, gray-striped fur ball with enormous green eyes. i liked him but i wanted nothing to do with him.
i grew up with countless cats in the yard of my parent's home in canberra, australia. in the late 1980s, my father, a postman, went broke and the cats became a luxury. instead of cat food, we gave them scraps of meat from the sheep that dad slaughtered for halal meat.
the cats were a burden. dad abandoned a few at the local dump, but let two or three stay. i think he saw how much they meant to me. i didn't have many friends, and i spent my school lunchtimes in the library reading books. at home, the cats were reliable company.
but i developed nasty allergies as a teenager. cat hair triggered violent sneezing. my eyes watered and my skin itched. my parents gave the last cats away. i didn't touch another feline for two decades.
then i moved to ramallah. it's a fun place, with hipster bars and country outings, but i had few friends. i was lonely. my old childhood yearning for a friendly cat welled up inside. my roommate lost interest in the kitten and soon i was letting him sit on my desk as i wrote. i took two or three antihistamines a day to breathe. he slept curled into a ball near my shoulder. i took more pills. i took to calling him shawareb for his funny kitten mustache.
i knew he was mine when he got sick — a tooth infection left him a smelly, mangy mess. i drove him to jerusalem to see a vet. he removed most of shawareb's teeth and charged me $400.
when we went for a follow-up, demonstrations had broken out through the west bank. the main israeli military checkpoint was closed as soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked youths hurling rocks and flaming bottles. i tried to leave through another checkpoint. masked young men burning tires on the road stopped me.
the road is closed, auntie, one of them announced. he glanced into my car and i grimaced.
most palestinian residents of the west bank can only enter jerusalem with hard-to-obtain israeli military permits. here i was, cavorting about with a cat, no less, for a follow-up at the vet. i felt silly. it wasn't lost on me that my ramallah street cat may have more freedom of movement than the area's human residents.
i called the vet in jerusalem. i'm late. there's a few problems on the road.
where are you? he asked. ramallah, i answered. oy vey, he responded.
over the next 18 months, i moved five more times — it was a procession of bad-luck apartments, from ramallah to jerusalem. shawareb came with me.
he grew into a friendly thing, always seeking out a lap to sit on. he meowed endlessly for attention. he left mauled birds under my bed. my cat allergy disappeared.
in november 2016, i decided to leave the new york times — and jerusalem. i packed my things into boxes. but shawareb?
i got in touch with an old friend, amit. he lived on a communal farm known as a kibbutz on the israel-lebanon border. he promised to care for shawareb until i could take him.
last february, i drove six hours across the country to deliver shawareb to amit in kibbutz misgav-am. shawareb settled into amit's tiny apartment. i thought about my life that had taken me across these enemy lands — for me a patchwork region of the middle east that i loved deeply. covering its conflict and suffering left me tired and broken hearted. the sun set into a gorgeous sky of pink and orange, and i said goodbye. i left jerusalem in march.
enlarge this image toggle caption diaa hadid/npr diaa hadid/npr
then during my visit to washington last june, i began thinking: could i find a way to move shawareb to islamabad?
for weeks, i plotted how to ship him to islamabad with ahava cohen, who works with kreiner, the israeli vet. we needed a third country that had direct flights to tel aviv and islamabad. we had three options: london, istanbul and bangkok.
the airline had to be cat-friendly. the third-country airport had to process shawareb quickly. we settled on bangkok.
cohen cheerfully informed me that the company would do the move for $3,335 — over double the yearly wage of a cook in islamabad.
that's immoral, i thought. if i did it myself, it would be about half the cost.
there was a glitch: i had just moved to pakistan, but i only had a single-entry visa. if i left the country, i couldn't re-enter.
i asked on a reporters' facebook group in jerusalem if somebody could take the cat to bangkok — i'd pay — causing a pileup of journalists cheerfully volunteering for the flight. but the problem was pakistan: getting a visa here is hard, and i feared problems for anybody coming from tel aviv.
then amit called with some pressing news. he moved apartments and his new landlord didn't want pets. shawareb had to go. i begged for more time.
i finally received my pakistani multi-entry visa in october. i arranged for a week off in january.
but those days were planned for another big day: my wedding in australia. i eyed the dates. if i cut short our honeymoon, i could fly to bangkok and pick up the cat.
suddenly i was spending money furiously on shawareb's big move. i paid for my flight, which included agreeing to pay $25 for every kilogram of shawareb. he's 8 kilos — 17 pounds.
i paid for amit's trip to bangkok. friends in bangkok directed me to a cat-friendly hotel while we sorted his papers.
amit arrived in bangkok with shawareb. i arrived at 3 a.m. to the cat-friendly hotel. shawareb meowed when i open the door. i curled up with the cat on the couch and slept.
the next morning, i handed shawareb over to a travel company with the dubious job of transforming him: from a palestinian cat with israeli papers into a thai cat heading to pakistan. they only needed a few hours, they said, and they'd drop shawareb off at the airport.
with a few hours before my flight, amit and i caught up. he talked me through shawareb's epilepsy medicine, and gave me a tincture for his anxiety.
we lost track of time. i raced to a taxi.
i sat on my suitcase at gate 4 as hundreds of people poured in through sliding doors. shawareb soon emerged on a luggage trolley, pushed by a representative of the thai travel company.
toggle caption a friend of diaa hadid's for npr
in suvarnabhumi airport, traveling with a cat is like presenting a baby. shawareb was smiled at and treated gently, even when he was put through a scanning machine.
the representative gave me two envelopes: one with all shawareb's israeli documentation, another with his new thai papers.
nearly a year after i drove shawareb to a kibbutz on the israel-lebanon border, my little palestinian cat made it home. amid the crowds and chaos of islamabad's benazir bhutto international airport, a luggage handler left shawareb's carrier near the baggage claim. a pakistani man on my flight carried him over to me.
nobody asked for shawareb's papers. there seemed to be some security alert. airport staff were busy screening all the suitcases coming off the flights.
shawareb is still adapting. he hisses at doodh, the elderly siamese cat that i'm taking care of for a friend. he wants constant belly rubs. when i video call my husband, he sits in front of the screen. he shredded the black foam of the recording studio.
and when he jumps on my desk, crunching the keyboard with his paws and deleting my work, i cuddle him and bury my face in his fur.
i'm so happy he's here. i hope we make it together, to our next destination.
boeing to pay $2.5 billion settlement over deadly 737 max crashes

boeing will pay more than $2.5 billion to settle a criminal charge related to the two 737 max plane crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.
the justice department has announced that it has reached a deferred prosecution agreement with boeing to resolve a charge of criminal conspiracy to defraud the faa.
boeing admits to criminal misconduct for misleading regulators about the safety of the troubled jetliner, but the airplane manufacturer is not pleading guilty to the charge. if boeing complies with the terms of the settlement, in three years the government will drop the criminal charge. that's important for boeing, a huge federal defense contractor, because a criminal conviction would prohibit the company from getting future government contracts.
under the terms of the deal, boeing will pay a criminal penalty of $243.6 million, which is less than 10% of the $2.5 billion settlement. most of the rest, $1.7 billion, will go to airlines that purchased 737 max planes to compensate them for lost revenue during a lengthy grounding of the aircraft type while the cause of the crashes was investigated. another $500 million will be paid into a fund to help compensate the families of those who were killed in the crashes.
the agreement protects only the company from further prosecution, not employees who may have engaged in misconduct.
federal prosecutors say key boeing employees deceived the faa, misleading the safety regulators about a new flight control system on the 737 max called mcas.
that system activated erroneously, contributing to the deadly crashes, by forcing the planes into nosedives that the pilots could not pull the aircraft out of.
a 737 max-8 jetliner operated by indonesia's lion air plummeted into the java sea shortly after taking off from jakarta's airport on oct. 29, 2018, killing all 189 people on board. another 737 max-8 operated by ethiopian airlines crashed in a similar way into a field shortly after taking off from the addis ababa airport on march 10, 2019.
the federal investigation found that boeing employees misled the faa about the significance of the mcas system and didn't mention the flight control system in pilot training and flight deck manuals, so most pilots didn't even know the system existed before the first crash.
the tragic crashes of lion air flight 610 and ethiopian airlines flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers, said acting assistant attorney general david burns in a statement announcing the agreement.
boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the faa concerning the operation of its 737 max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception, burns added.
misleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by boeing employees to the faa impeded the government's ability to ensure the safety of the flying public, said the u.s. attorney for the northern district of texas, erin neely cox, whose office led prosecution.
boeing sought to downplay any corporate responsibility and placed blame instead on two former technical pilots who in documents uncovered during the course of investigations, were found to be mocking and misleading faa officials. ceo david calhoun said their conduct doesn't reflect boeing employees as a whole or the character of the company.
this is a substantial settlement of a very serious matter, calhoun said in a message to company employees. i firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations.
carl tobias, a law professor at the university of richmond who specializes in product liability law and who has reviewed the deferred prosecution agreement, said: there's some really damning language in there about sacrificing safety, you know, for profit, basically, and that's troubling.
it did not find widespread fraudulent behavior in the company but these two central employees did engage, according to the government, in very bad conduct, tobias added.
but by singling out those two boeing employees accused of deceiving faa regulators, critics say the justice department is letting boeing off the hook.
i find this fine to be inadequate given the egregious nature of the offense, said democratic congressman peter defazio of oregon, who chairs the house transportation committee, in an interview with npr. his committee's investigation into the design, development and initial certification of the 737 max found widespread evidence of engineering and management failures at boeing, as well as grossly insufficient oversight by the faa.
this settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist and is an insult to the 346 victims who died as a result of corporate greed, defazio added. i hope the doj can explain its rationale for this weak settlement to the families, because from where i sit this attempt to change corporate behavior is pathetic and will do little to deter criminal behavior going forward.
michael stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter samya rose stumo died in the ethiopian airlines crash, also sharply criticizes the deferred prosecution agreement.
this is a boeing protection agreement, stumo told npr. there's nobody being held accountable, personally. stumo added that the justice department is letting the fraudsters off the hook.
stumo dismisses the notion that only a couple of employees were responsible for misconduct in the rushed development of what was boeing's most profitable commercial airliner in the history of the company.
a couple of people could not have made this killer plane, said stumo. it took large organizational conduct.
munich security conference reveals a growing rift between u.s. and its allies

the u.s.-led liberal world order is falling apart, according to the organizers of a gathering of world leaders and defense chiefs in germany that has met annually since the cold war.
the munich security conference report said the trump administration displays an irritating enthusiasm for strongmen across the globe and disdain for international institutions and agreements.
for much of this past week, the growing rift between the u.s. and its traditional european allies has been on display.
first, in warsaw, poland, the u.s. organized a conference seeking to marshal international outrage over iran, and vice president pence urged france, germany and the u.k. to abandon the iran nuclear deal, accusing them of concocting a scheme to continue to business with iran. top european allies trying to keep the nuclear deal alive declined to send top-level diplomats to the conference.
then on saturday, in munich, german chancellor angela merkel addressed the security conference with several critiques of u.s. foreign policy – and received a sustained standing ovation.

she resisted pence's calls to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal, arguing the deal can help countries pressure iran over issues that concern the u.s.: iran's ballistic missile development and its role in wars in syria and yemen.
merkel also criticized the u.s. decision to withdraw its troops from syria. is it a good thing to immediately remove american troops from syria, or will it not strengthen russia and iran's hand?
president trump's daughter ivanka, who was in the audience, did not join the applause that followed.
pence defended u.s. global leadership in a speech to the conference, saying nato member countries have boosted their defense spending thanks to trump's urging. that's what we call being leader of the free world, he said.
the end of speech was greeted with short, muted applause.

european leaders are doing themselves no favors in bashing trump, wrote judy dempsey, a nonresident senior fellow at carnegie europe. even if trump was to be defeated (and that's a big if), a change in the white house is not going to fundamentally change the dynamics of what is happening in europe.
she noted china's interest in acquiring strategic assets in europe and the toxic combination of china and russia's ambitions to divide and break the west.
a power competition is emerging among the u.s., china and russia, and other countries are unwilling and incapable to step up as guardians of the liberal order, the security conference report argued.
a new pew research center poll, published in the report, suggests that germans believe russia's vladimir putin and china's xi jinping handle world affairs better than trump does.
brazilian president bolsonaro withdraws from u.n. compact on migration

in his second week in office, far-right brazilian president jair bolsonaro has pulled the country out of a u.n. migration pact, fulfilling a pledge he made before taking office.
brazilian diplomats told local media on tuesday that the country officially left the agreement. a diplomat also told reuters that brazil has exited the pact.
bolsonaro appeared to confirm the withdrawal on wednesday, tweeting, no to the compact on migration.
defense of national sovereignty was one of our campaign's banners and it will be a priority of our government, he wrote. the brazilians and immigrants who live here will be safer under rules that we ourselves make, without external pressure.
brazil's departure from the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration marks the latest rejection of the non-binding agreement, which has drawn protest across the world, especially from far-right politicians in europe. nearly 30 countries, including the united states, refused to sign the pact in december.
brazil was among the majority of countries that signed onto the compact, under the country's previous administration.
bolsonaro's decision to leave the agreement follows guarantees the president-elect and his foreign minister made last month, after a polarizing election and runoff.
the bolsonaro government will withdraw from the global compact on migration being launched in marrakech, an inadequate instrument for dealing with the problem, tweeted ernesto araújo, now the country's foreign minister, in december. immigration must not be dealt with as a global issue, but rather in accord with each country's reality and sovereignty.
more than 700,000 registered immigrants live in brazil, according to the migration policy institute, along with several hundred thousand more undocumented immigrants. by far the largest segment comes from portugal, followed by japan, italy, paraguay and bolivia.
meanwhile, brazil has become one of the primary destinations for an increasing number of venezuelans fleeing a political and economic crisis at home. at least 65,000 venezuelans have sought asylum in brazil over the last four years, according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees.
geoff ramsey, assistant director for venezuela at the washington office on latin america, told npr last fall that about a dozen tent camps were operating on the brazilian-venezuelan border.
last month, araújo tweeted that brazil would continue to welcome venezuelan asylum-seekers even when it withdrew from the compact, though it would also focus on the restoration of democracy in venezuela.
the u.n. accord has become a focal point for anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in europe. marine le pen, leader of france's far-right national rally, called the agreement a pact with the devil. and in brussels last month, thousands of protesters took to the streets carrying anti-immigration banners as they rallied against the pact.
the trump administration refused to participate in the agreement more than a year ago, while other countries agreed to the pact last summer but pulled out before it was formally adopted, including austria, hungary, italy, chile and australia.
bolsonaro's government, now just over a week old, has drawn comparisons to the current u.s. administration, including in its rhetoric on refugees. on wednesday, the brazilian president echoed president trump's language comparing national security to home security.
if we decide who we let into our own houses, why would we do any differently when it comes to our brazil? he tweeted.
in a televised address on tuesday night, trump argued for his proposed border wall by pointing out that wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes.
bolsonaro has taken his victory as a mandate to change the country's foreign policy, according to an op-ed by his foreign minister published in bloomberg on monday.
we are convinced that brazil has a much larger role to play in the world than the one we currently attribute to ourselves, araújo wrote.
tax the ultrarich to solve poverty? easier said than done
enlarge this image toggle caption nichole sobecki for npr nichole sobecki for npr
a new report from oxfam says that just 1 percent of amazon owner jeff bezos' fortune — estimated at $112 billion — would cover ethiopia's entire annual health budget. that's health care for 105 million people.
so, oxfam proposes, let's tax the rich to help the poor.
it's not a new idea. in fact, oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity — $8.4 trillion in 2018 — with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity — $1.4 trillion. the reports coincide with the world economic forum, where elites gather in davos, switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.
the latest report — published on monday and called public good or private wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. in 2017, it was 43 individuals.
but would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?
oxfam thinks so. its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to u.n. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.
the rich are doing very well — thank you very much — and those on the wrong end are working harder and harder for less and less everywhere we look, says paul o'brien, oxfam america's vice president for policy and advocacy.
reducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, oxfam argues.
and that's certainly a pressing issue. even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the world bank has warned that progress is slowing. what's more worrying, according to oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.
but is a global wealth tax realistic?
o'brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. but he is optimistic about the odds. major agencies like the international monetary fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the world economic forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.
but until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. the oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.
according to alex cobham, chief executive of the tax justice network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.
for example, a couple of years ago, the tax justice network worked with the australian taxation office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through singapore. oil and gas giant chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.
but not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.
proper taxation is important, but it's one thing among many that we need to do to address poverty, says vijaya ramachandran, a senior fellow at the center for global development.
ramachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. the oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.
cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.
then there are what harvard business school professor and co-author of the prosperity paradox clayton christensen calls market-creating innovations. christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. but outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.
on the other hand, christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. these types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.
whether through a global wealth tax or other practices, oxfam's o'brien just wants to see inequality reduced now.

voices from the southern border: perspectives of those who live and work there every day
president trump has called what's happening on the u.s.-mexico border a crisis. but what is it like for the doctors, judges, mayors and border patrol agents who live and work there?
to justify the need for a wall along the u.s.-mexico border, trump has repeatedly described the situation at the border as a crisis. but what is it like for the doctors, aid workers, judges, mayors and border patrol agents who live and work along the border every day? we talked to people from every single border state - california, new mexico, arizona and texas - and asked them, what are they experiencing? while the people we spoke with agree there is a crisis, they differ over the kind of crisis and how to solve it. here's what they said.
norma pimentel: i am sister norma pimentel. and i'm director for catholic charities here in the rio grande valley, overseeing the humanitarian response that we have here in our border. i believe that people that are not from here don't have quite a complete picture of what life is here at the border.
and unfortunately, when we hear all these narrative of the importance of wall and sending out criminals and protecting us from crime and all these ugly people that are coming, i realize that they're failing to see a part of the immigration reality that we see on a daily basis - people who are just like us, who are suffering and hurting and in need of great help. i believe what our holy father speaks to us about - the importance of building bridges and not walls.
douglas nicholls: i'm douglas nicholls. i'm the mayor of city of yuma. we have had a long history dealing with immigration. and we're in a better position now that we have a barrier that was constructed in 2006. i believe it's - would be effective in most places, although i'm not completely convinced it's for every installation. a physical barrier is a very kind of first-step deterrent. immigration reform would be the primary (laughter) wish list item and then just more facilities, family shelters.
there - we have no ice family shelter here in arizona, so those individuals need to be moved to texas. so we need those kind of facilities here. and then immigration judges are on my wish list. if we had immigration judges that were available at the border, processing could happen quicker. and we could relieve some of the flow that's coming through.
ashley tabaddor: my name is ashley tabaddor. and i'm the president of the national association of immigration judges. the crisis we see is that we have an immigration court that is structured within the justice department, so the court has been repeatedly used throughout the years as an extension of law enforcement policies. and we believe that that's where the crisis lies.
as long as we continue to have the immigration court within the justice department, we continue to have the problems that we have seen plague the court - the backlog, the compromise to the integrity of the court through the quotas that have been placed on the judges, the lack of adequate funding for interpreters or support staff, hiring a hundred judges and not having enough courtrooms or support staff for it. so we think it's really important to focus on fixing the court.
theron francisco: my name is theron francisco. i am a border patrol agent here in san diego. in san diego, we're seeing a pretty big increase in the amount of family units we're apprehending and the amount of unaccompanied children. we are averaging about 154 arrests per day just in san diego. we agree with needing a wall.
san diego has been a prime example of how walls work. in the late to mid-80s to early '90s when there was no infrastructure at all, we had hundreds of thousands of apprehensions. assaults were at all-time highs on agents. and through the addition of new infrastructure, updated, new technology coming in in addition to more agents, we were able to bring our numbers down. it can't be just one. it's the combination. it's that whole system that really is effective.
dee margo: dee margo, the mayor of el paso, texas - the only large u.s. city on the mexican border. we need to control our borders. no, i do not believe that a fence will suffice when it comes to protection and homeland security issues. our fence that runs - was done during the bush administration. and it runs through part of downtown and on the west side of our city - hasn't been so much a stop for illegal immigration as it's been for, basically, criminal activity, where we used to have folks from mexico coming over and stealing vehicles.
but the rhetoric related to being unsafe or things like that or all this drug trade coming over, we don't have issues that - we don't have - i asked my police detail about ms-13 gang members the other day. and they thought they maybe could identify one here in el paso. right now we're just dealing with - primarily, the biggest challenge we have is this migrant community coming north, seeking asylum.
and the bottom line is that's not going to change until they change our immigration policies in washington. and that's the responsibility of both sides of the aisle. and they haven't had the fortitude to deal with it for over 30 years.
lucy horton: my name is lucy horton. i'm an infectious disease fellow at uc san diego. i've been working in tijuana at different shelters and camps that are currently housing the migrants. they're not able to process the asylum seekers and immigrants as quickly as they were before the shutdown, which means that they, potentially, could be facing prolonged times in the detention facilities.
the conditions are pretty squalid - people living in extreme crowding. sanitation is terrible. sometimes, there's no access to clean drinking water. the prolonged detention in these crowded conditions is really concerning for a spread of communicable diseases. it doesn't seem like it's as much of a security threat as a humanitarian crisis.
esequiel salas: i'm mayor esequiel salas for the village of columbus, n.m. there are many crises. but i don't see it as a crisis as it has been described. the crisis is further south in honduras, guatemala because of their economy, because of countries interfering with their country, upsetting their political systems in order to benefit from them. it causes chaos. it causes gang wars. and some of these people are fleeing - of course, all that violence. and they're coming up here. and we're just getting the waves of the whole thing. and it won't be resolved by putting up a wall. i'll tell you that.
garcia-navarro: that was sister norma pimentel, yuma, ariz., mayor douglas nicholls, judge ashley tabaddor, border patrol agent theron francisco, el paso, texas, mayor dee margo, dr. lucy horton and columbus, n.m., mayor esequiel salas.

why north korea's kim jong un may be leaving the door open to nuclear talks
enlarge this image toggle caption ahn young-joon/ap ahn young-joon/ap
after keeping the world waiting and watching, first for a christmas present to the u.s., and then for a new year's shift to a harder line on nuclear negotiations, north korean leader kim jong un delivered neither.
some analysts believe a key reason behind his calculations may be president trump's prospects for surviving an impeachment process and possibly winning a second term in the white house.
donald trump happens to be the first sitting u.s. president to view north korea as a source of political victory, for domestic purposes, says go myong-hyun, a research fellow and expert on north korea at the asan institute for policy studies, a seoul-based think tank.
pyongyang has said it has no intention of handing president trump any victories on denuclearization, but officials see trump's eagerness to tout achievements to his domestic audience as a source of leverage.
in remarks carried by state media, kim on tuesday had plenty of tough words for the u.s. as he addressed a plenum of the ruling workers party central committee. he acknowledged the countries' current stalemate on nuclear talks, but insisted he would not passively wait for things to improve.
we should never dream that the u.s. and the hostile forces would leave us alone to live in peace, but we should make [a] frontal breakthrough with the might of self-reliance, he told the plenum as it wrapped up four days of meetings.
he also asserted that north korea is no longer constrained by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing.
still, kim said pyongyang had unilaterally halted nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in order to build confidence with the u.s. and he appeared to leave the door open for concessions and further talks.
north korea expert park hyeong-jung predicted that outcome even before the speech.
park is with the korea institute for national unification, a government think tank in seoul, and says pyongyang will not take any action to damage its relationship with the u.s. irreparably.
pyongyang had warned it could take a tougher new way if the u.s. failed to meet its demands for concessions by year's end.
kim jong un will have to stage some anger at the u.s. and chastise them for ignoring his year end deadline, park predicts, but could be willing to return to the negotiating table by summer if the u.s. shows signs of accommodating pyongyang.
still, a lot could happen in u.s. politics by summer. if they calculate that president trump won't be re-elected next year, says analyst go, then their approach is going to fundamentally change. at that point, go says, pyongyang could unleash provocations that leave little room for compromise.
for now, analysts see a prolonged stalemate over north korea's nukes as all but inevitable.
nuclear weapons are very good for self-defense, and for preserving the existing status quo, argues texas a&m university political scientist matt fuhrmann. but he says they're not especially useful for forcing changes to the status quo, as in using nuclear threats to blackmail your adversaries.
fuhrmann says that kim has been relatively successful in acquiring nuclear weapons in order to ensure the survival of his regime, and it is unlikely that he could be compelled to give them up.
but using nuclear threats to extract concessions from the u.s., such as security guarantees or the sanctions relief pyongyang seeks, would be far more difficult. this is because actually using the nukes would all but ensure the regime's extinction, fuhrmann says, even if they continue to build their arsenal.
north korea's only remaining tool is nuclear brinksmanship — essentially bluffing opponents into thinking pyongyang might actually use atomic weapons, even though it is plainly evident that the cost of doing so is prohibitive for both sides.
fuhrmann's theory has implications for policy: a nuclear-armed north korea is not the apocalyptic event some fear, even if we might prefer a situation where they were not to have nuclear weapons.
he advises that a complete and verifiable nuclear disarmament is somewhat unrealistic. better, he says, for the u.s. to look for a deal that allows us to place meaningful limits on north korean capabilities.
democrat sherrod brown tours early voting states
ohio democratic sen. sherrod brown hasn't decided to run for president yet. he's on a tour of early primary states, like new hampshire, testing out a message focused on the working class.
it's still just february of 2019, but the 2020 presidential race is already up and running. it's the most diverse field of democrats ever, some more known than others. and they all want to challenge president trump next november. they've also announced their candidacies in a variety of ways. here's senator elizabeth warren at a rally yesterday in massachusetts.
elizabeth warren: i stand here today to declare that i am a candidate for president of the united states of america.
garcia-navarro: author and spiritual adviser to oprah, marianne williamson, announced her candidacy on stage in los angeles last month. and in texas...
julian castro: and i'm proud to call myself a son of san antonio.
castro: i am a candidate for president of the united states of america.
garcia-navarro: former congressman john delaney announced via a washington post op-ed back in 2017. and earlier this month, senator cory booker tweeted his news with a slick campaign video.
cory booker: in america, we have a common pain. but what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose.
garcia-navarro: a new york tech entrepreneur announced by video, too.
andrew yang: hello. i'm andrew yang. and i'm running for president as a democrat in 2020.
garcia-navarro: then there are the television talk shows. here's representative tulsi gabbard on cnn.
van jones: are you going to run?
tulsi gabbard: i have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week.
garcia-navarro: and senator kamala harris on good morning america.
(soundbite of tv show, good morning america)
robin roberts: do you have an announcement you'd like to make?
kamala harris: i am running for president of the united states.
garcia-navarro: senator amy klobuchar says she's making a big announcement this afternoon in minneapolis. what could it be? several more potential candidates have formed exploratory committees but haven't quite made it official, like south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg. and here's senator kirsten gillibrand on the late show with stephen colbert.
(soundbite of tv show, the late show with stephen colbert)
stephen colbert: how often does the exploratory committee go out and explore and come back and go, yeah, yeah, don't run?
kirsten gillibrand: well, it's an important first step.
gillibrand: and it's one i am taking because i'm going to run.
garcia-navarro: and then there's sherrod brown, the populist democratic senator from ohio. even though he's still mulling a run for the presidency, brown's essentially in campaign mode, visiting key early voting states. he's seen by some as the antidote to donald trump's popularity in the midwest. npr's asma khalid reports from his latest stop in new hampshire.
asma khalid, byline: sherrod brown calls this trip his dignity of work tour. he's an evangelist for workers and better wages. at a bookshop in concord, he insisted, you don't win a state like ohio if you don't understand that.
sherrod brown: democrats think you have to choose between running to the progressive base, as i believe we should, and talking to working families, talking to workers, that it's a choice. and it can't be a choice.
khalid: brown and his supporters will often point out that he's been talking about unfair trade deals and working class wages long before donald trump entered the political arena.
brown: i look at the phony populism of donald trump, always dividing people with his rhetoric.
khalid: part of brown's goal is to reclaim populism.
brown: real populism is never racist. it's never anti-semitic. it doesn't divide people. it doesn't give tax cuts to rich people. it doesn't do any of those things, real populism. and that's what this fight's about.
khalid: it's an economic message ripe for the democratic primaries. and a woman in the crowd, lizzie shackleford, tells brown she hopes he joins the race. she thinks he has what it takes to fundamentally shift the equation between corporations and workers. but then she raises an issue.
lizzie shackleford: my biggest concern, though, is how you will win the primary at a time when democrats are really looking for change from white men.
khalid: there's a slight pause, a few mmm hmms in agreement, and some chuckles. brown acknowledges the awkwardness but then dives into an explanation.
brown: i think the race is about ideas. and i think democrats understand that.
khalid: he then points to his voting record in congress.
brown: if we're in the race, i will be the only one on stage that's had a longtime f from the nra, only democrat on stage that voted against nafta. i'll be the only democrat on stage that voted against the iraq war. i'll be the only...
khalid: brown is highlighting both his progressive credentials and his experience. he's been in congress longer than most of his fellow democrats running for president. and his answer was convincing to voters like sally helms and her longtime friend gerri king.
sally helms: he sounded like he really had an answer to that question.
gerri king: i think he's asked himself that question.
helms: right, and he's got a wife who probably asked him that question.
khalid: his wife is connie schultz, the spunky, pulitzer prize-winning journalist who introduced him at this event. she's got her own fan base among progressives. one of the things you hear from people who've supported brown for a long time is that he is the real deal. and that's how helms felt after hearing him.
helms: he's about the fifth or sixth candidate that i've seen. and he's my favorite.
khalid: brown is far less known than some of his colleagues in the senate who've already declared their presidential ambitions. it's not clear how he would compensate for low name recognition. but he has something few other democratic candidates have - midwest credibility.
pat clark: he comes from a state, a gritty state, ohio.
khalid: pat clark, like a lot of people who tell me they like brown, mentions the senator's roots in ohio.
clark: one of those states that has a lot of industrial complexes, many of which have turned to rust. and he's been a champion and tried to bring back good jobs.
khalid: in the 2018 midterms, brown won ohio by nearly 7 points. in 2016, hillary clinton lost the state by about 8 points. brown's logic is that if he can win ohio, then he could also win nearby states that are more liberal, like michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania. and if he can do that, then he could win the white house. asma khalid, npr news.

pediatrician who spotlighted lead in flint water weighs in on crisis
ex-michigan gov. rick snyder has been charged in the flint water crisis. npr's rachel martin talks to mona hanna-attisha, the pediatrician who nearly seven years ago, noticed something was wrong.
two counts of willful neglect of duty - those are the charges against former michigan governor rick snyder and former flint, mich., public works director howard croft for their role in the flint water crisis. the misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in jail. they come almost seven years after the city of flint began taking in water from the flint river in an attempt to save money. the water wasn't properly treated. it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. more than 100,000 flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead. latricea adams is a community activist in flint. this was her reaction to the charges against snyder and croft.
latricea adams: it doesn't feel good.
martin: adams heads black millennials for flint, which advocates for the rights of flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.
adams: accountability is great, but even with accountability, even if rick snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with flint residents.
martin: years ago, sometime after the city of flint switched to flint river water, pediatrician mona hanna-attisha started seeing something troubling. she treated a lot of children in flint, and her patients were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood since the change in the water supply. she called a press conference in september of 2015 and warned residents, especially kids, to stop drinking the water. more than five years later, dr. mona hanna-attisha is now the director of flint's pediatric public health initiative, and she joins us this morning. thanks for being here.
mona hanna-attisha: rachel, it's great to be with you.
martin: can i ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong? what was going through your mind?
hanna-attisha: oh, i remember the exact moment. it was the summer of 2015. i was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. and she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that, mona, the water isn't being treated properly in flint. and because of that, there's probably lead in the water. and that's the moment that my life changed. when i heard the word lead, it was a call to action. i respect the science of what lead does. i understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. and i also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. it's the last thing our kids in flint needed. that's the moment i stopped sleeping. i stopped eating. i lost about 30 pounds. and i began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.
martin: which it was. i mean, so now here we are seven years later, it's hard to believe, these charges now against the former governor and another top official. what do you make of it?
hanna-attisha: it's a bit of disbelief. it's been so long. and for so many people in flint, this justice delayed really felt like justice denied, that there was never going to be this level of accountability. and as a physician in flint, i never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. there was these criminal cases and civil cases. and as i began to practice more in flint and interact with the families of flint, i began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never close, and it stays open and open and open. and it's been open for about seven years. and having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.
martin: you've written a book, and in it, you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. can you explain how you see that?
hanna-attisha: absolutely. so, you know, so many people ask me, like, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? and there's not one villain. there's not 10 villains. there's many villains. and this is what i say in my book. i say there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices, then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who are culpable, the real villains are harder to see because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism and even laissez faire neoliberal capitalism. and these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison flint with policy. and i hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.
martin: what is - what could that possibly look like now? i mean, even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?
hanna-attisha: yeah, and that has been my work since day one. from the moment of recognizing kind of this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. you can think of what happened in flint as a case of science denial and our science helps speak truth to power. and we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. so what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support flint families, like child care, like medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access - all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. because what flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. and people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.
martin: would the crisis have happened had flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?
hanna-attisha: of course not. flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. it never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. there's a long history of racism in flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.
martin: you, as the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is in just a couple of seconds remaining.
hanna-attisha: sure. my focus is to make sure that the kids of flint have the brightest future possible, that we not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.
martin: dr. mona hanna-attisha - she's a pediatrician, the one who first called attention to the water crisis in flint, mich., all those years ago. she's the author of the book what the eyes don't see: a story of crisis, resistance, and hope in an american city.
thank you so much for talking with us.

'atomic blonde' director brings stuntman skills to his 'punk rock spy thriller'
enlarge this image toggle caption jonathan prime/focus features jonathan prime/focus features
in the new film atomic blonde, british agent lorraine broughton (charlize theron) shows up in 1989 berlin and gets a very violent reception. the film shows lorraine punching, stabbing and shooting her way through the murky world of cold war espionage — not exactly surprising considering atomic blonde was directed by former stuntman david leitch.
leitch did stunts for fight club, 300 and the bourne ultimatum, among many other films, before jumping into the director's chair. he describes his new feature as a punk rock spy thriller.
on how he assesses an actor's ability to do their own stunts
we start showing them sort of like choreography, fight moves, with the idea to see their aptitude and checking up their ability to match motion or to remember choreography. and then you start to build sequences based on their ability, and obviously there's a training progression that goes along with that.
on charlize theron's aptitude for stunts
she's incredible. she's off the charts — in the top 1 percent of all the actors that we've worked with. you know, there are actors, like keanu [reeves] and hugh jackman, who can just remember this choreography like insane, and she's one of them. you know, 25 moves and you can change the one in the middle on the day and she still remembers it. ...
she really wanted to bring the physicality to it, and she really challenged us to challenge her. and so it was a great collaboration. i mean she showed up every day committed to train hard and to put the body mechanics behind it and not just make it sort of window dressing for a fight scene. it's like she's selling every single punch. and i have to say that that's rare. i mean, people come in and there's a little lack of confidence. you're intimidated standing in a room full of stunt people who do it for a living. and she would, you know, get over that and just go to work and has an aptitude for it.

on how a woman might fight differently than a man
there was a section of the movie we really wanted to ground in some sort of reality where the consequences felt real. and i guess in terms of having someone her [theron's] size fight a 6-foot-4, 230-pound russian, you know, there are techniques that you would use that obviously you don't always see in movies, but elbows and knees, you know, body weight throws, leverage techniques. you know, punching with your fists is not optimal when the guy's head is made of granite. so it's better to use weapons of your body that are more resilient and that have a stronger force.
... punching with your fists is not optimal when the guy's head is made of granite.
on pitching his vision for the film to theron, who owned the rights to the graphic novel atomic blonde is based on
it was based on a graphic novel which was like sort of cold war noir, very like the third man dark noir. ... as i opened up the script and as i read about berlin and the city — and having done six movies there — i thought about: this is nothing like '60s noir; this is '89 berlin. there's rock 'n' roll; there's graffiti. if you were a spy there, you'd be living in this crazy underworld of clubs. and then music started to jump off the page at me that i wanted to infuse into the movie.
so i put together a song list and i put together a series of images that were really sort of based in, like, the street art and the graffiti movement and punk rock. and i said, i want to take this sort of stuffy noir and make it a punk rock spy thriller. and i think that's what sold her.
on the film's soundtrack, which includes songs by george michael, the eurythmics and duran duran
i think music transports you immediately. ... as i was reading the script, certain songs spoke for certain scenes and certain set pieces — some to play sort of a juxtaposition to the violence there, you know, to lighten the tone; and others to dive in deeper into really where the spies were in their own personal stories in the movie. ... the other goal of atomic blonde was to create this protracted music video vibe throughout the movie. ... how do we make this feel like a contemporary version of [an] '80s music video the whole way through?

on how james mcavoy's broken arm made it into the movie (mcavoy plays a fellow spy in berlin)
he was going to come onto the movie after christmas break and i get a call over the holidays. he's like, i broke my arm. i'm like, what? and so there was some shuffling around and then everyone panicking for a second, and then i came up with this idea that we make it part of his character. so the cast in the movie does play a story point. ... and it becomes part of his spy craft at the end of the day, which is fun. you know, the things that happen in production that you just have to react to. the show must go on, as they say.
on what he wanted to accomplish with this film
for me it was really to try to take the [spy movie] genre and give it a different spin. i feel it needed to be dusted off, or at least try to push the boundaries a little bit. i think the infusion of music, the infusion of the type of martial arts action took it in a different direction.
and then obviously the female protagonist of it all isn't seen that often and quite frankly needs to be seen more. i think we have this opportunity on the heels of wonder woman's success that maybe more films with female protagonists in the action space can enter theaters and can get made and greenlit into production.

For its part, Gilead said it could proceed to develop the drug quickly without the special regulatory status.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Good morning, dear lady.
Certainly, it's the case that Christians were terrified of ISIS and fled. ISIS has desecrated churches and shrines. Some Christians have lived in ISIS-controlled areas and paid a tax to the terrorist group. And there have been Christians killed and kidnapped — 88 Eritrean Christians from Libya who were kidnapped by ISIS in 2015 two months after 28 Ethiopian Christians were executed; 262 Assyrian Christians kidnapped from the Tel Tamer area in Syria and held for ransom; 50 killed in Tel Tamer in suicide bombings.

You know, Trump is someone, to me, where the things I try to lock into and kind of hold onto just for that brief five minutes of the cold opening is that he's not having any fun. He doesn't shut up about how rich he is. He doesn't stop talking about how much money he has and how much privilege he has. And he just seems miserable. I mean, if he's an advertisement for wealth and privilege, then, good God, I think it's terrible.
JENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.
GROSS: Oh. Do you want to do some of the patter for us?
Feeling the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, the National Rifle Association is planning to lay off staff and taking other cost-cutting measures in the face of extraordinary challenges from COVID-19, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the NRA, announced to the group's board of directors on Monday.
At this point, if president-elect Donald Trump were to hold a press conference every day starting today, he wouldn't hit Obama's mark for formal interactions with the press during the transition period.
Already, no president-elect (dating to at least Jimmy Carter) has waited longer to hold a press conference. One irony — perhaps hypocrisy — of Trump's extended run without a press conference is just how critical he and his campaign were of rival Hillary Clinton's choice to go an extended period (276 days in total) without holding one. His campaign sent out daily press releases counting the days since her last press conference, headlined, Hiding Hillary Watch — and, at one point, Trump even tweeted about it:
RICARDO ROSSELLO: The governor of Puerto Rico was run as a big Ponzi scheme. What you had was essentially a black box of a government running that had no clarity as to what was being borrowed and what was being spent.
There are tradeoffs. One upside: Washington doesn't have a state income tax. A downside: The couple now pays double for housing, since they still have the mortgage on their Chicago condo. They're not ready to sell that yet, in part because she doesn't know if or when she'll have to return to the office.
Orphan drugs are among the most expensive in this country, in part because they are shielded from from generic competition for longer than other prescription medicines.

Higher consumption of calories from subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some cardiometabolic risks, the authors conclude. For instance, they found a higher probability of both obesity and unhealthy blood glucose levels (which raises the risk of Type 2 diabetes) among people who consumed the most calories from subsidized foods.

And it is a distortion of the police function. Police discretion is an extraordinarily important resource in the criminal system. We rely on police discretion to advance public safety, to make sure people are treated fairly. And when we put pressure on police officers to produce citations and low-level arrests when they might not otherwise exercise their discretion that way, we're really interfering with a key aspect of the system's integrity.
GROSS: So I just want to make sure - I know a lot of our listeners are probably thinking, is this person arguing that misdemeanors should not be punished or that there shouldn't be misdemeanors or that everybody should just be left alone - no jail, no fees or fines or bail? So what are you arguing for? I mean, you want reform, but you're not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system.
TRUMP: And there are certain things that I don't like.
RAINBOW: Yes, I open my live show with it now, actually.

It can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. If they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. They may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. So now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.
TRUMP: Well, no. I just think he's - first of all, he's a character.

As with so many other things, Trump is flouting this tradition. He hasn't held a press conference since July 27, when he called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at his resort in Doral, Fla. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
GROSS: What was your first reaction when you realized that Trump was tweeting about your impersonation?
The Census Bureau has been busy trying to hire around a half million temporary workers to help carry out the upcoming national head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially kick off next January.

Now with it being nationwide, it's going to have an impact, there's no doubt about it, he said. It will be a little less only because if you live in California, you don't have to run over here to make a bet, you could do it right from there.
Another potential point of conflict is the issue of immigration, with Democrats in need of at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass Biden's sweeping immigration bill.
But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports. That believe me folks is what our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. — Donald Trump

The state would borrow the money for projects and pay the debt back over a long time — up to 20 years.
But Wolf said it's worth borrowing the money, and thus paying the interest costs, because of the benefits.
We place an import levy on cheap sugar from abroad, says Paarlberg. We use it like a quota system to keep cheap sugar from the Caribbean or Australia or South Africa out of our market. And without the global, free market competition, that raises the price inside the U.S. market ... for all sweeteners, including high fructose corn syrup, he says. Also, a significant amount of corn grown in the U.S. is used to make ethanol, so this demand also keeps the price of corn up.
RAINBOW: But no, I - when I first moved to New York, my dear friend from childhood was working at Hooters as a waitress and said the manager here is a gay guy. And if you come in, he'll probably give you a job. So I worked first at Hooters as a host. So you can imagine the look of dismay on the gentlemen's faces when they would come in after a hard day's work and I'd be standing there with my clipboard. So that was the first thing.
GROSS: So in light of what you just told us about what you describe as snitching, what do you think of the use of giving information in return for a more lenient sentence as is being done by the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York in investigating the Trump administration?

Carnoy's studies of cities including Milwaukee argue that this effect fades over time.
NATAPOFF: The problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the American criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. It's essentially a market. Ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. They're not a result of a trial. We almost never litigate guilt anymore.

The bill includes cash payments of as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per married couple. Individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, and $150,000 for joint filers, would receive the full payment. People earning over that amount would see their payments reduced by $5 for each $100 in income over that amount. The benefit completely phases out for individuals earning over $99,000 and married couples making more than $198,000.
JENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...
Narayan acknowledges the study has shortcomings. For instance, the methodology — known as a cross-sectional study — captures the association at just one point, a snapshot in time.

The chicanery that Cohen described involved nearly every aspect of Trump's public life and career, according to his allegations.
All the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers. Donald Trump says he wants to preserve Social Security benefits and is counting on stronger economic growth to help pay for that.
The rapid developments come as lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the spread of the virus within the Capitol.
He takes inspiration from the digital nomads he follows on YouTube and travel blogs. They seem to enjoy a sense of freedom and possibility in their lives that he hadn't been feeling in his own work life, he says.

TOTENBERG: Not really. I suppose you could note that in this case, he's agreeing with not just the court's liberals but with conservative icon Scalia. But he did write separately to say that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand it. Still, this is just one vote in one case from a justice who otherwise has a very consistently conservative record. So at least as of now, you really can't draw any conclusion.

White House Looks Outside Washington For Republicans Who Back COVID-19 Aid Plan
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's a professor of law at the University of California Irvine and, before that, was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.
Some of the bill's provisions push the envelope, including reaching into state law. To settle the controversy over redistricting, the bill would simply take away the power of state legislatures to draw congressional districts and have independent commissions do it instead. That way, presumably, the local politicians could no longer gerrymander the districts to help their party and cripple the opposition.
Biden signed the bill Thursday, securing the first major legislative accomplishment of his term. The legislation includes direct payments, which Biden said would begin to go out as soon as this weekend, extended unemployment benefits and an expanded child tax credit. There's also billions of dollars set aside for schools, businesses and the expansion of the country's vaccine rollout. (Read more about the details here.)
I'm not going let this trial drag on, he said. I'm not in the theater business.
The bill would require the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize and expedite the review of new drugs. It also includes requirements that insurers pay for COVID-19 testing without a fee for patients; free coverage, without cost sharing, of certain vaccines as they become available; and $1.32 billion in additional funding for community health centers.
If the bill ever becomes law, it's unlikely to happen this year. Republicans control the Senate, President Trump is in the White House, and the GOP vehemently opposes the basic approach of HR 1.
That's when we locate, to the best of our ability, the moment when a well-known thing or person first showed up on NPR. Lately, we've been discovering when the current presidential candidates appeared. Today, it's Donald Trump.
Without reimbursement of those subsidies, Pennsylvania Health and Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller told the Senate Finance Committee Monday, insurers in her state reported they would need to request a statewide average increase of 20.3 percent in the cost of health plan premiums. Those increases are similar nationwide.

More likely is that Republicans could try again for a health overhaul via its fiscal 2019 budget resolution, which is due next April. That would leave them only a few months before the 2018 elections. Still, it's possible, particularly if they can use the time to reach consensus.

STEIN: Yeah, yeah. It's really fascinating. You know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this CRISPR gene-editing tool inside the retina. The CRISPR then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. Here's Eric Pierce. He's the Harvard doctor running this study.
But for lots of us, understanding trade deals isn't easy because international commerce creates a complex web of winners and losers — all stretched over a nearly $19 trillion U.S. economy with 323 million people. With an issue so big, how can a voter reach good decisions about candidate positions?

The pipeline proposals include granting the Public Utility Commission authority to regulate locations of intrastate lines. No state agency has that authority. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees interstate pipeline siting, but the lack of authority within the state has fueled opposition to lines like Energy Transfer's cross-state Mariner East project. Mariner East 1, 2 and 2x carry or will carry natural gas liquids from western Pa. to an export terminal near Philadelphia.

Instead of a tax, Pennsylvania came up with a unique way of handling the fiscal impacts of drilling. In 2012, the legislature passed a special impact fee. Gas companies pay a fee for each well they drill. Most of the money goes back to the local governments where drilling is happening.
But remember that Carrier is best known for making air conditioners. As recently as 1993, about a third of U.S. homes had no air conditioning. Now, only about 1 in 10 lacks air conditioning. The change largely reflects the plunge in AC prices, thanks to lower production costs. Even a retiree with limited income may be able to afford a foreign-made room air conditioner for as little as $112 at Wal-Mart.
His solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.
The Republicans, their African-American party chairman notwithstanding, need to determine whether they will stand on ideas — and which ones — or resort to old tactics and tropes. The civil rights leadership, having been denied the respect and appreciation most deserved in their prime, sometimes seems to the younger generation overpraised and accorded excessive deference now, to the point where some younger leaders fear they will never be free of these elders' assumptions and expectations.

Carrier provides a slam-dunk example that NAFTA is bad for Americans, right?
Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States, Trump continued. These nations must pay what they owe.

We have to pay twice as much for it, but it's worth it so that we can say we offer California-caught and processed squid, owner Mitch Conniff says. Squid that's caught two to three miles away takes a 10,000-mile round-trip journey before I can get it back into my restaurant.

We have been vocal in our expectations that the Biden Administration has to have a plan and has to address gun violence as a public health emergency and that starts with staffing, that starts with who they're hiring and who they're empowering and the voices that they're amplifying, Markham said in an interview.
That means the bureau could have to hire even more workers.
At one store, the student's eye is caught by a 19th-century painting, and he convinces the store's initially belligerent proprietor to tell him about the subject. It turns out to be a portrait of Fredrick M. Petrie, who arrived in a small town called La Verne at the same time as a cholera epidemic. [T]he doctor was soon the only person brave or fool enough to duck under the quarantine ropes, ignoring warning signs he himself had nailed to doors of those farmhouses worst hit, the store owner explains. Despite the doctor's help, the townspeople turn on him, blaming him for the wave of illnesses. In La Verne, if we act too kind or smart or interested in much, they'll make us pay. And pay. And pay, the shop owner says.
GROSS: Just one more question. I haven't heard you as the announcer of the New York Philharmonic radio broadcasts. I know you fell in love with classical music being stuck in traffic jams in LA and listening to the radio. Do you do, like, an announcer voice, the kind of voice you grew up with?

But Democrats are scoping out this district, because its political demographics have shifted over the past few elections. President Trump won it by 10 points in the 2016 election, which was was already a shift from 2012 and 2008 when Mitt Romney and John McCain won it by more.
I'm thinking about transitioning into this job because it's very important to me, Hudson adds. We have children that need education. We have children that need health care.

With tobacco we faced the same thing for many, many years. We were trying to encourage people to quit: Because if you don't quit you're going to die! he says.

The more expensive it is the less you're going to be willing to spend your precious money on something that isn't good for you.

And so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses. Often, individual - vulnerable individuals are pressured into becoming informants at great risk to their lives. The government can launder a lot of its mistakes through cooperation and through the plea-bargaining process. So it's an opaque, under-regulated aspect of a market that is all - that hasn't gotten enough attention.
The problem for the Republicans when they do this is if we start talking about a 10-point wave year, he says, all of those districts suddenly become competitive in a way that no one would have thought they would be competitive two years ago.

This proposal totally fails to prevent the corporate excesses and abuses that followed past taxpayer bailouts, Blumenthal said in a statement. Instead of corporate welfare, there should be grants and loan forgiveness for small businesses, which are the job creating backbone of our economy.
RAINBOW: They are, yes. They're - they are ripped karaoke versions that I play with and sort of fine-tune and adjust to be, you know, unique to my videos.
In the two previous rounds of stimulus payments, adults who could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return were not eligible for money, a move that excluded more than 13.5 million adult dependents, according to the People's Policy Project.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So it seems a little strange to be talking about why something doesn't matter, but here we are, saying President Trump's budget - which is being released tomorrow - suddenly isn't that important. How did that happen?
Marijuana Pays For Schools In Colorado — Kind Of — But How Will It Help Maine?
The rest of the retail price is set by packaging, processing, shipping and advertising. Some economists have argued that the cardboard box costs more than the corn inside the box, Paarlberg says. So, 85 percent of what we pay for food has nothing to do with commodity prices.
MARTIN: That is amazing. So what happened? I mean, can you explain in layman's terms what they did?
TOTENBERG: Well, there was a Filipino immigrant who'd lived here for 25 years. The court's decision today overturned his deportation order for two burglary convictions. Now, the law on deportation defines a crime of violence as one involving actual force or a substantial risk of force. And today's decision follows one written by Justice Antonin Scalia in 2015. It says that the language in this statute is so vague that it invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
Kettl says government agencies don't just need to blindly downsize; they need to do a better job of identifying the skills and talent they need, and being more nimble at attracting them.
Critics of the NRA seized on the group's financial woes, arguing that the economic hard times were driven by more than the coronavirus.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he is disappointed in the decision and pledged to pursue other legislation to increase the minimum wage.
For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand, he said. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump.
GONYEA: Like some others, Petersen wishes more candidates had come but added that holding the event is a good sign that the party may pay more attention to rural America in the 2020 campaign. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Storm Lake.
Democratic presidential hopefuls are in heartland America this weekend, making their case to rural voters in the small town of Storm Lake, Iowa. It's part of a broader push by Democrats to make inroads in traditionally Republican strongholds ahead of the 2020 election. NPR's Don Gonyea was there.
And then in 2000, as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, [Futuramic was] faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. — Hillary Clinton
The president said then in response to a reporter's question that he thought Democrats needed to yield more ground in their negotiations over the relief legislation, although he didn't go into detail.
At the request of the Washington Post, Moody's Analytics recently modeled Trump's trade proposals for Mexico and China. It showed that if Congress were to approve such changes, China and Mexico would fall into recession — and about 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, and another 3 million jobs that otherwise would have been created will be lost.
And some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. What about the issue of immigration, which is, of course, tied to budget deal-making in Congress right now? Where does that stand, and where does the president stand?
Michael Cohen Calls Trump A 'Racist' And A 'Con Man' In Scathing Testimony
BALDWIN: Well, my dad grew up in Brooklyn. And I think my dad just, you know, he saw a tough part of Brooklyn. He played football at Boys High. He went to Syracuse and played football, and he was around some pretty tough people. And they moved to a tough - to Fort Greene when Fort Greene was not a good area like it is now. It's all been built up. And I think when he moved out to Long Island, like a lot of city dads, it was almost like we didn't move out here for you to get it wrong, you know?
Americans are told to fill 50 percent of our plates with fruits and vegetables. But here's the contradiction, as the researchers see it: U.S. agriculture policies focus on financing the production of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy and livestock, the researchers write. About $170 billion was spent between 1995 and 2010 on these seven commodities and programs, according to the researchers.
The belt-tightening in response to the virus outbreak includes the elimination of certain positions and forcing hourly employees to work just four days a week, in addition to 20% reductions in pay for NRA staffers.
We often hear that a particular White House official was surprised or that they felt one way or another. Without a direct quotation, this is either a species of omniscient narrator or an example of reporters protecting their sources. In this work, as in much contemporary reporting, reporters offer a real-time, firsthand narration of events they did not witness personally. We are being given the eyewitness accounts secondhand.
On NAFTA's 20th anniversary in 2014, economists re-examined the fallout and concluded it was largely a wash — with the U.S. losing some and gaining some. After reviewing that NAFTA research, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said: The general consensus in the literature is that NAFTA has not had significant effects on aggregate outcomes in U.S. labor markets.
But more recent research has found that private schools, like charter schools, can actually hurt the academic progress of the students who choose them. Studies of programs in Louisiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., found students who left for private schools did worse, not better, compared with their peers.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HE'S IN LOVE (AND WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE))
The day before President Biden's allies on Capitol Hill were set to roll out his sweeping immigration overhaul, a group of activists rallied outside of the headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, projecting a message onto the building's façade.
KING: Yeah. That's right. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut yesterday to try to protect the economy from the effects of the virus, but it didn't seem to work. The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all fell yesterday anyway.
One early point of tension came when Biden, speaking at a CNN town hall, outwardly rejected calls to eliminate up to $50,000 of student loan debt, a priority of many young organizers and liberal Democrats.
When it comes to those workers who have already moved, Lewis says it depends who those workers are.
She and House Democratic leaders had hoped to fast-track legislation they unveiled earlier this week but so far discussions with Republicans about possible changes hadn't gone smoothly enough to permit that.

CAPACETE: There were some hard-line tactics to sell the funds, you know, like go out and get them. Let's go. You got to sell these funds. They were just trying to push the bond funds to whoever had a heartbeat.
And Kemp went on to say, Real leadership is not just seeing the realities of what we are temporarily faced with, but seeing the possibilities and potential that can be realized by lifting up people's vision of what they can be.
LIASSON: Well, we're looking forward to what he has to say about this because he really personifies the total reversal by Republicans about deficit spending. They've done a 180-degree turn on this. Most economists say what they just did was fiscally irresponsible, exactly the opposite of what you want to do when the economy is booming, and there's low unemployment. You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase.
ELVING: That showdown just five years ago kept a lot of people working in Washington straight through Christmas week and New Year's Eve until an agreement was struck. It might have gone down to the wire this year, too, but deals got done this past week and Congress finally got out of town.
LIASSON: So this is exactly the kind of thing that Republicans railed against when Obama was in office. And Senator Rand Paul, in his brief effort to hold up that funding bill, asked, are we only for fiscal responsibility when we're in the minority? And I guess the answer is yes.
Even with squid being sent on a round-trip journey across the world, the California market squid fishery has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry.
He reminded his 17 grandchildren of the indignities, small and large, that he saw his teammates and friends endure. But he also went on to say, I could go on and on ... but just imagine in the face of all these indignities and deprivations, Dr. Martin Luther King could say 44 years ago, 'I have an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in mankind.'
Altogether, Trump's plan would slash revenues and thereby grow the deficit. His former plan would have added $9.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. This one, with its higher income tax rates, would cut that figure, though it's unclear by how much. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and informal advisor to Trump, said the addition to the deficit would now total $3 trillion.
Just one exploratory well has been drilled in the coastal plain, on Alaska Native land in the 1980s, and the results are a closely-guarded secret.
Donald Trump apparently blessed the meeting his son held with a Russian delegation to get dirt on opponents in 2016 and welcomed advance word of efforts by WikiLeaks to disrupt the election, his former lawyer told Congress.
TRUMP: Why shouldn't I like him? I like him, get along great.
A pledge to pass the bill was a common theme among Democratic House candidates last year.
I was doing this daytime TV show, which was fun. And it was important 'cause it was the beginning for me. But I just think about what I would have done to - you know, to show my dad how much I loved him and cared about him, too. You know, he - my dad was somebody who if - you know, I would have sent him around the world 10 times to enjoy himself to pay him back for what he did for me.
The payment to another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, was made on behalf of Trump by the publisher of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., run by Trump's friend David Pecker.
MCEVERS: By the way, Trump did settle that racial bias case brought by the Justice Department, but did not admit any wrongdoing.
And Muslims have fought ISIS more than anyone else. This includes Kurdish Sunnis and Arab Sunnis and Shiites, who are on the front lines and often allied with U.S. advisers in the battle against ISIS, as well as Turkmen Muslims. Some of the most horrific videos from ISIS have shown the killing of Sunni Muslims who have fought the group, like a Jordanian pilot and Turkish troops shown burned alive.

More than 90,000 people have applied for 2020 census jobs through the bureau's website, and since late December, the agency has hired more than 680 workers. The bureau is expected to make a more high-profile push for job applicants through an advertising campaign set to launch in January 2020.
For starters, the plant will further entrench the fossil fuel industry in the state's economy.
And then there's the idea that crop subsidies don't necessarily make food cheaper. Here are two reasons why. First, only a tiny slice — an estimated 15 percent — of the price we pay for processed foods, say, a box of cornflakes or cookies made with wheat and corn syrup, actually goes to the farmer.
BALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) Even Arnold?
And reason No. 2: Paarlberg argues that U.S. policies actually increase the price of some foods. Take, for example, corn sweeteners. Paarlberg argues that the price of corn syrup is driven up by the fact that the U.S. taxes imports of foreign sugar.
For years, Las Vegas has held a fairly exclusive lock on legal sports gambling like this in the U.S. But a Supreme Court decision to strike down an act that effectively banned it in most of the rest of the country now means other states can permit and regulate it, too. And while that means more competition for Las Vegas, casino executives and longtime bookmakers in Nevada are welcoming the decision. They say permitting sports betting is good for everyone in the industry. Besides, they say, people come to Las Vegas for more than that.
If Iowa or California borrowed money and defaulted, you wouldn't expect people living in Iowa or California to lose their money, too. And what was more unusual, Puerto Rico imploded over municipal bonds. They're supposed to be the most boring, safe financial investments out there. You buy a Puerto Rican bond, Puerto Rico pays you back later with interest.
RAINBOW: Yeah. And I guess, you know...

Christensen is leading the rollback effort in Utah. His alternative proposal, SB 96, would cap the number of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid, add work requirements and lower the annual income limit. Prop. 3 supporters had wanted the coverage available for people who made up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year. But Christensen's bill would offer Medicaid coverage only to people who made less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 for an individual.
It makes sense, says one of the study authors, K.M. Venkat Narayan, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.
In many jurisdictions, the list of fees, ranging from a few dollars here to $10, $20, $30 or a hundred dollars there, can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars on top of whatever punitive fine the court decides to impose.
GROSS: OK. So let's hear another song, and this is to the tune of Sixteen Going On Seventeen from The Sound Of Music. And the song is about President Trump's endorsement of Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. And this is when Moore was running for the Senate against Democrat Doug Jones. And Trump endorsed Moore in spite of the fact that several women had come forward and accused Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were underage girls.
The lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.

Friday's ceremony kicked off a sort of victory lap during which Biden, Harris and their spouses will travel the country next week promoting the package.
The Donald J. Trump Foundation has acknowledged in a tax filing that it violated the ban against self-dealing, or using its assets to help its leader's business or personal interests, The Washington Post reported.
So although I don't know who Gail Atwater spent her afternoon with in the lockup, it's possible that anyone in her situation could have spent the afternoon with people accused of very serious crimes, violent offenders, people with mental health or substance abuse issues. And she had an arrest record, so her information now is in the booking system. And it's an arrest record that will follow her for the rest of her life.
GROSS: He hasn't released them. You haven't stopped.

RIVERA: They wanted to try to get as much as they could of their exposure out of their books.
The breakthrough followed hours of negotiations between the speaker and the administration, including more than a dozen phone calls on Friday between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the priorities for the package.
JENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.
In Lansing, he enjoys the proximity to his family, a cheaper cost of living and the local schools for his daughter. When there's not a deadly virus, it is a fun town, he says.
-- The White House has raised a conflict-of-interest question to challenge newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, who will oversee the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
In the past we've seen too often where there will be a public engagement arm and it's just separate from the actual policy work that's happening in an administration, said Audelo. And that's just unacceptable and that is not what young people are trying to do. They want to make sure that their concerns, that the unique perspective that young people have into the fight on climate, into the fights on the economy... that those perspectives, their ideas are reflected in actual policy discussions.
Owners will not be able to use the funds to give themselves raises or increase their own profits, McConnell said. The point is to help small businesses endure, help workers keep their jobs and help workers and businesses emerge from this ready to thrive.

Further complicating matters is this: By law, most charter schools must have open enrollment, using a lottery if they have more applicants than spots. However, charters, and private schools, have sometimes been accused of using strict discipline rules or other measures to filter out underperforming or otherwise undesirable students.
She was booked, fingerprinted, spent a couple hours in the lockup and eventually pled guilty to and paid the fine for the seatbelt violation. The most she could have been punished for that violation was $50. It's a traffic misdemeanor. She could not have gone to jail for the seatbelt violation, but nevertheless spent time in jail as a result of the arrest.
But here's the reality: While Christians in Iraq and Syria have been killed by ISIS, Muslims have been the group's victims far more frequently and represent the strong majority. Shiite Muslims are killed by ongoing waves of ISIS bombings of Shiite neighborhoods, and Shiite members of Iraq's security forces have been victims of mass ISIS executions.
The judge said he intended to get a jury seated expeditiously and then keep the process moving once it had begun following the new start date.
Businesses with fewer than 500 employees could apply for fee-free loans of up to $10 million that could help cover payroll, employee salaries, mortgages, rent and some other debt obligations. Businesses that retain their employees and payroll levels between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, would have any of that money used for payments on preexisting debt and payroll forgiven.
This is the part of the state that was Republican before Republicans were even a major factor in the state, said Sean Theriault, a political science professor at the University of Texas.
He has found a spot that I think aligns very well with Pennsylvania public opinion, Borick said. He's never called for a moratorium on natural gas, but he's been strong in his proposals and demands for an extraction (or severance) tax.
BIDEN: And we were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it'd be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy.
SULLIVAN: Puerto Rican officials for their part told me they needed the cash to make payroll. But when I went back to the bankers I had met, several of whom had worked on the deal, they told me something else. They said this bond was more than just a bond deal. They said it was also an exit strategy for the banks. See; in the years before the bond, the banks had been loaning Puerto Rico money or making investments in other ways. Government documents show hundreds of millions of dollars were now at stake on an island in financial trouble.

Revenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.
Some epidemiologists predict that by 2050, half the adults in the country could suffer from diabetes in their lifetime.
It's not clear what income ceiling might be put on the stimulus payments, but Mnuchin said the government does not want to send checks to millionaires.
RAINBOW: Well, I've kind of worked it down to about four or five takes because I could stand there all day. And, you know, as a director, I'm quite hard on myself. The reaction shots are something that I've learned from my audience is more valuable than I even knew. I think that I did inherit a very expressive face from my mother and my grandmother. And yeah sometimes just a look to the camera or a slow burn says much more than even, you know, a song.
COSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.
The biggest challenge was trying to find out where the squid goes when it leaves to the United States, she says. No one wants to say where they partner. It's a bit of a challenge. In the United States we keep such good records of all of our fish and seafood. There's no comparable system in China. I couldn't follow the chain backwards.
They may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.
Remember; this started out as the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history. The front-runners now are two white men in their 70s, both with long political careers - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
And he didn't realize - well, I take that back. He did realize, but I think he was puzzled with how to deal with the fact that people that moved out from the city brought all of the problems of the city with them as well - 'cause kids that are unoccupied, they're going to do drugs and drink and party and things like that. So my dad was very, very - I'm not going to say menacing, but he was very, very forceful with us.
A New York Times investigation based on interviews and legal documents suggested the results were not promising.

Rainbow uses the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. His YouTube videos were just nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series.
Congress would have to pass resolutions allowing remote voting, which would require either unanimous consent or an in-person vote. Either is a high bar, making the policy change unlikely at this moment.
Neither Barclays nor any of the other banks would agree to an interview. In statements, banks said they fully disclosed their financial stake in the deal and did not influence how Puerto Rico used the money. Morgan Stanley said they also extended Puerto Rico $250 million in credit after the bond. It was difficult to find bank insiders to talk on the record about this. And then I found one former broker who would.
COSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.
And Cohen didn't lie only to Congress, observed Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn. He also lied on his tax forms for the Internal Revenue Service, transgressions that were part of his guilty plea in a federal case in New York City.
Previous books about Trump have also prompted debates about sourcing and attribution. Like Michael Wolff's two efforts at exposés and Bob Woodward's Fear, this account relies on a mélange of on-the-record and off-the-record insiders with varying degrees of proximity to the president.
TRUMP: No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion.
Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sports retailers in the U.S., has announced it is immediately ending its sales of military-style semi-automatic rifles and is requiring all customers to be older than 21 to buy a firearm at its stores.

He said it would keep foreigners without a South Korean bank account and minors younger than 19 from trading bitcoins and other digital currencies. Accounts that have been used until now to trade such currencies will be discontinued, Kim said.
Still, while Trump said he reiterated to Merkel his strong support for NATO, he was also careful to emphasize that NATO allies need to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. It's a point he has repeated often, maintaining a skeptical view of the defensive alliance — a position that has made Germany and other European countries wary.
BALDWIN: Well, I'll always remember, like, just lines that I used to think were funny. You know, like, those men - I loved men in movies who they always won. And they won in some funny way. Like, there's that time that Bogart has got - Elisha Cook Jr. has gotten him in the hotel. And he's walking him up to go meet Sydney Greenstreet in Maltese Falcon. And he's got the gun on him. And Bogart disarms Elisha Cook Jr. And he gets the gun away from him and he points the gun at him and says, come on. And he says, that will get you in real good with your boss.
Shortly after the gas boom started, in 2009, the state House (then controlled by Democrats) passed a severance tax. It was defeated by Republicans in the Senate.

GROSS: And to you. And I should say that this song starts with you being interviewed, so to speak, by Wolf Blitzer of CNN about the results of Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign coordination with the Russians. And then you start singing about the results of the investigation.
Clinton's plan, meanwhile, goes in the opposite direction: she relies heavily upon taxing the rich, a major way she pays for her other programs. Lower and middle-income people, meanwhile, would see their incomes change little — some with a slight decline — while the richest one percent would see their incomes fall by 5 percent or more, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. The Tax Foundation likewise found few income changes for people who aren't the very highest earners.

There aren't too many American authors for whom the publication of a new book is a bona fide literary event, but Allan Gurganus is one of them. The North Carolina author took the book world by storm in 1989 with his debut novel, Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, which became a massive bestseller and spawned an Emmy-winning television miniseries adaptation. Only four books followed after that.
That Trump's camp encouraged Cohen to lie to Congress and the public about the negotiations the Trump business had carried on with powerful Russians about a potential Trump Tower real estate deal in Moscow. The statement Cohen prepared, he said, was edited by Trump's lawyers. In a statement provided to NPR Wednesday night, Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's personal attorneys relating to the Justice Department's 2016 Russian election interference investigation, said Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.

This president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it, Kettl says.
Federal payroll and benefits make up less than 10 percent of the federal budget, Light says, and a hiring freeze has a way of encouraging good workers to leave.

On another occasion, we are told, Trump summoned various officials to discuss the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign governments to secure business contracts. Trump said he wanted that law erased. Told he could not do undo legislation by fiat, Trump reportedly turned to ultra-loyal aide Stephen Miller and said: Steve, draft an executive order to repeal that law.
Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly named the chair of the state Republican party and used comments made about last year's budget proposal. The story has been updated with comment from Pennsylvania House Republican leaders.
Trump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a magic bullet. Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.
Presidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president.
Those consolidated, lower rates would largely benefit wealthier taxpayers. Not only that, but Trump would drastically lower the corporate tax rate and eliminate the estate tax — both of which are standard Republican talking points.
It was brilliant for about two days, she recalls. The high-rise building offered floor-to-ceiling windows, a gorgeous roof deck and an outdoor pool.
You mentioned that part of the misdemeanor system is often referred to as meet them and plead them, so, you know, lawyers encourage - often encourage their clients to just like plead guilty and get it done with. So if you decide to take the conviction and you take the plea, what are the consequences of that? Now you have a record.
McConnell spoke about the bill on the Senate floor on Thursday before the draft was released. He said the legislation would include billions of dollars in forgivable federal loans for small businesses.
EDWARD KLEINBARD: Logically the United States should be troubled by the low tax rate in Ireland, and it should be not at all troubled by the commission's finding that Ireland entered into a one-off negotiated deal to subsidize Apple.
Wolf's rhetoric around addressing climate change is at odds with his desire to expand Pennsylvania's petrochemical industry. During his reelection campaign last year, Wolf linked the need for renewable energy to his support for the massive ethane cracker Shell is building outside Pittsburgh. Once it's online, the plant will be among the largest air pollution sources in the state.
BROWN: Nobody living can ever make me turn back. This land was made for you and me.
RAINBOW: No, I don't believe so. No. He had no interest. I don't think - again, he really had no idea that there was anything wrong with him. It was everybody else.
A recent important study showed that Chinese goods hurt low-skilled Americans. China's immense workforce helps create a lot of wealth in the U.S. (e.g., Apple grew wildly by using China as its manufacturing backshop) but it tends to make low-skilled workers in the U.S. worse off — not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. Economists also say that low-cost imports from China hold down prices for U.S. consumers.
Theriault added that the way Republicans redrew the districts in recent years could backfire and actually help Democrats in this election.
KLEINBARD: Well, they should be taxed today, exactly, on the current basis by the United States. Apple is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they want to tell Europe that profits are really because of the genius of the American operations, and they want to tell the United States that the operations are really located outside the United States.
Despite the recession-related dip and Tea Party backlash, trade bounced back in popularity by 2013 and 2014. Clear majorities of Americans said trade was more of an opportunity than a threat to them. In 2015, Pew found Americans continued to support trade in general — and even TPP specifically.

Why would voters ever want to pursue ballot initiatives and direct democracy if the legislature's just going to repeal it anyway? Slonaker asks.
Cohen told members of Congress that Trump told him to threaten his former schools with lawsuits if they released records about him to reporters.
This is in no way putting a drilling rig in the middle of a forest, said Republican Camera Bartolotta in a story reported by WITF's Katie Meyer. Three miles away, these things can be done. And it's 6,000 feet underground.
What he believed in most was so-called supply-side economics, the tax-cutting philosophy that is most closely associated with conservative Republicans like Ronald Reagan. But what he also believed in was equal opportunity.
GROSS: You've done a parody of Trouble In River City from The Music Man.
Closing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two.
It's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.

Seeking more seats at the table
However, we believe that the best way to achieve these goals and turn them into a reality for all our citizens is not just with new government programs, more spending and additional debt, according to the statement.
Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack announced the firm's decision on ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday, the same day that survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to class. Stack said the 19-year-old gunman allegedly behind that massacre, which claimed 17 lives and wounded many more in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a firearm from the retailer last November.
And for many people, those bail fees are out of reach. And so they remain incarcerated because they can't pay. And so we've seen around the country - many jails are filled with individuals who are there not because they've done anything particularly wrong or pose any particular threat or even a risk of flight but simply because they can't afford to pay bail.
Tripp says during her research, it was nearly impossible to track down where exactly the squid was being processed abroad.
GONYEA: Now to Julian Castro, he was asked about balancing environmental concerns with farming. He said it's about the choices the government makes in the tax code and on where to invest.
Biden does owe a lot to young people. But it's not just repaying us for helping him to get elected, it's making sure that he actually is working with us, said Charlotte Kerpen, the chair of the High School Democrats of America. For Biden to have a group of young people that he can really consult to, would make sure that the policies are not only reflecting the beliefs of young people, but are helping to make sure that in the future, the policies are representing what we have always believed.
Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski worked with the White House to open the coastal plain to drilling as part of Trump's massive 2017 tax bill. The idea was to create revenue to offset tax cuts, so the legislation directed the federal government to carry out two oil and gas lease sales by 2024.
And by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars in auction proceeds to make our air cleaner and our transit systems stronger so that Pennsylvanians can get to the jobs businesses are creating, he said.
The basic idea is that the government would start a fund — in Clinton's case, $25 billion — and use it to finance major projects, for example through loans and loan guarantees (this CBO report is a good background). This can help spur new private investment that construction projects do not currently attract, as the left-leaning Center for American Progress explained in a 2012 report.
GROSS: How did you get to know Sondheim?
MARTY JACKLEY: That small business on Main Street is losing its sale. That's not fair. That's not right, and that should not be constitutionally sanctioned.
It's about making sure that we get the things that we need in our community, that everybody is counted regardless of their race, regardless of whether or not they're a citizen, she says. We're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.
Cohen was asked whether he believed it was possible that Trump and his family might have been compromised or whether they might have been willing to collude with the Russians.

President Biden and Vice President Harris spoke at the White House Rose Garden Friday afternoon in a ceremony celebrating the passage of the administration's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this week.
RAINBOW: Absolutely. Yeah. And it was a full-time job to sort of, you know, try to brush the cloud away. And you know, that's why I was really happy at 21 to leave the house. And that's kind of where - when my life really began and I kind of came out of my shell.
In the state House, the legislation was introduced with 99 co-sponsors. That's nearly a majority of members supporting the measure in the 203-seat chamber.
Justice Kagan suggested that in failing to address the issue for so long, Congress has in fact made a choice. It likes the status quo. Justice Alito added, do you have any doubt that states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency have a strong incentive to grab everything they can? And Justice Breyer suggested that even if major changes in the law are needed, Congress can craft a better law than the court can.
NATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.

That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away. — Donald Trump

Here are some of his arguments.
That jump was yet another metric of heightened Democratic enthusiasm and intensity, key elements when partisan wave elections occur, political analyst Charlie Cook wrote. Having said that, some Democrats are overhyping what happened, forgetting that Texas is still Texas, and that for every two Democrats who voted, three Republicans cast ballots.
Republicans reject Cohen's claims out of hand
I think there's a listening ear that's coming from the administration and Democrats on the Hill, for that matter, said Ben Wessel, the executive director of NextGen America, a progressive group dedicated to mobilizing young people. I think time will tell whether that listening ear becomes an action oriented or a legislative strategy.

Precedent favors frequent press conferences during transition
It's easy to see why the story resonated so much last year with readers who were just weeks into a pandemic of their very own. In 31 pages, Gurganus spotlights the best and worst in America: the selflessness of those who put their own lives in danger to help others, and the inexplicable mean-spiritedness they're too often subjected to in return. It's a story that hits way too close to home, and Gurganus tells it beautifully, with an underlying anger that nonetheless never turns to cynicism.
Trump ordered Cohen to find a fake buyer for a portrait of Trump to make it appear that the painting had sold for a lot of money and was therefore valuable; actually, Cohen said, Trump arranged to use money from his foundation to inflate the sale price.
A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 37% of Republicans support Biden's $1.9 trillion package. But it has strong support from independents and overwhelming support from Democrats, meaning nearly 7 in 10 Americans support the proposal. Individual elements of the plan, particularly the $1,400 direct payments, enjoy strong support.

Jeff Nobers, executive director of the Builders' Guild of Western Pennsylvania, said Wolf's pragmatic approach is better for unions in Pennsylvania than that taken by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The two U.S. senators each has called for a ban on fracking.
RAINBOW: You know what? I think that one was a request. Now I have this nice following, so sometimes I will take requests from my fans online, and I think that was one of them.

Many voters in this district seem to have their minds made up, even though some don't even know the names of the candidates.
5) If you really can't annuitize anything, live on Social Security plus 3 percent of your beginning assets each year (4 percent if you are quite unhealthy). For example, if a person enters retirement with $200,000 in assets, they will need to adjust their consumption to hit Social Security plus $6,000 per year. If they consume more money than that, they risk running out of everything but Social Security, which has its own problems.
LIASSON: ...And one in Virginia. In some places, he didn't even campaign. It turns out that free media - earned media - momentum really mattered. And that's what Joe Biden had. He had endorsements, and it translated into wins. Who would've thunk it?
GROSS: Does he ever give you advice on lyrics?
In these midterm elections, Democrats are looking to take back control of the House, which would break the control Republicans have of Congress and the White House. This is a race that doesn't top handicappers' lists — the Cook Political Report rates it as Likely Republican. So if this race were to go blue, it could indicate a very big wave on Election Night.
Meanwhile, dozens of state and local officials are issuing sweeping orders to close school for millions of children and shut down bars and restaurants for all but takeout orders. Areas hit hard by the spread of the virus, like San Francisco, have gone further, mandating that residents stay indoors and work from home.
House Speaker Mike Turzai, an Allegheny County Republican who opposes Wolf's proposed severance tax, said the plan will likely lead to at least $6.5 billion of new debt because of interest payments required to borrow the money.
TRUMP: We'll see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good.
This week, NPR and some member stations will be talking about trade on the campaign trail and in communities around the country.
Calamari is a favorite on American dinner tables. But while the U.S. has a thriving squid industry, chances are the calamari you are eating made a 12,000-mile round trip before ending up on your dinner plate. That, or it wasn't caught in the U.S. at all.
On top of that, Minott says, are the cracker's own emissions.

SULLIVAN: Marxuach said that for decades Puerto Rico was booming. It had the special tax break that lured pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to the island. But then in 1996, Congress began phasing it out. Within a decade, the island spun into recession and to compensate borrowed money.
In case there's another shutdown in the coming weeks, the bureau has said it has enough money to work on the 2020 census into April.
Trump also reportedly used foundation funds to pay for items that he and his wife, Melania, bought at charity auctions, including a 6-foot-tall painting of Trump himself.
However, he has said he wants to spend $500 billion or more on infrastructure, nearly double what Clinton wants to spend. Because interest rates are low right now, he has said, it is a great time to borrow. This puts him at odds with current Republican economic principles, which have focused more on reducing deficits.
Political observers say Wolf's middle of the road strategy plays well in Pennsylvania, the country's No. 2 gas-producing state.
SIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?
DONALD TRUMP: Doug gives tremendous credibility to the league. Ticket sales are going through the roof, and I'm not only talking about our team. I'm talking about many of the teams. Most of the teams were way up, and that's great. And that's largely attributable to Doug and to the league itself.

LIASSON: Yes, he did. The big question going in was, would Bernie Sanders end the night on a glide path to a plurality of delegates with an all-but-insurmountable lead? We came out of the night with Biden with the most votes and delegates so far, and maybe he's on track to get a plurality before the convention. The race is now a two-man fight for delegates.

UC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.
Justice Kennedy, however, had a blunt assessment. The assumption of many of these questions is that our prior decision is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference, and I'm suggesting it does. Justice Ginsburg called the old decisions obsolete. As I see it, she said, everybody should have the same tax collection obligation. Justice Gorsuch - why should this court favor a particular business model that relies not on brick and mortar but mail order?

And so within this market, we've created a kind of a black market, if you will, of cooperation, of deals between the government and individuals who are suspect or who have committed a crime in which guilt and information and cooperation are traded, often off the record, informally, without constraint.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson on the results of Super Tuesday. Mara, thank you.
Since the 1970s, the 21st Congressional District has been solidly in Republican hands. Incumbent Rep. Lamar Smith has held onto the district, which includes a large portion of Austin, for more than 30 years. But Smith is retiring at the end of this term — and with signs of a possible wave election for Democrats, Smith's exit has sparked hopes on the Democratic side.
GROSS: And they brought pink eyeglasses in honor of your - as a tribute to you.
But Trump knew about everything, Cohen said.
That leaves impeachment. And the single article has already been drafted - impeachment for inciting violence against the government of the United States. And the Democrats seem resolved to press for it on Monday. They would have the votes in the House. But, of course, the Senate would have to follow suit. That seems unlikely before the scheduled transfer of power on January 20. But we could see a return to the issue after that when Trump is gone with the idea of barring him from federal office for life. That historically has been done in a few cases of federal judges who had been impeached and removed.
STEIN: They just did this procedure at the Casey Eye Institute. It's at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. And it's on the first volunteer, first study that's testing this. So the first thing the doctors and the scientists are looking for is, you know, whether it's safe. Remember; you know, nothing like this has ever been done before. So they're starting with a very low dose in an older patient who already had extensive vision damage. And they're only treating one eye. And this is all, you know, just to make sure it doesn't backfire somehow, end up destroying whatever vision they do have instead of helping them.
Administration officials announced earlier this month major cuts to the navigator program, which provides funding to community groups that guide people through the complex task of signing up for health insurance through the online marketplaces.

ALEXANDRA NATAPOFF: Gail Atwater and her kids were driving around their local park very slowly - about 15 miles an hour. Her child, Mac, had lost his toy and the kids were looking out the window of their truck to try to find the toy. And they didn't have their seatbelt on. Their mom had told them they could take their seatbelts off in order to see out the windows to look for the toy.
We don't want to be partisan — we just want to solve the problem, Schumer said. We want to get something done quickly and boldly. That's a big job, but we have to do it because the crisis is even bigger.
A bipartisan effort led by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., to advance legislation to affirmatively fund the payments was reportedly progressing until Republican leaders stopped them to concentrate on efforts to pass the Graham-Cassidy legislation.
BALDWIN: ...Because he says that to his enemy in the film. And the very first movie that I watched with my dad that I was - that made me an addict - was we would watch Million Dollar Movie. And Sorry, Wrong Number came on with Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster. And that movie scared the hell out of me. The idea that a man would pay people to kill his wife to collect the insurance - and I was probably 8 or 9 years old. And I was a complete idiot. I'd look at my dad and say, gee, Dad - I was like Dondi out of Dondi comics. I was like, gee, Dad, do people really do that, Dad? - pay people to kill their wives to get the insurance, Dad? My father would, like, glare over at my mother and go indeed they do, yes, indeed they do.
CHRIS PETERSEN: Democratic Party, we got to talk about health care access. Rural hospitals are closing up. Everything is bad right now. And I tell you what. The Democrats need to stand up.

Welcome to trade. Let's get started learning.
And so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along. For public defenders in particular, having hundreds, sometimes thousands of cases that they have to resolve means that they don't have time to talk to their clients.
Donald Kettl, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, says he believes the freeze is really about a desire among Americans for better-functioning government, and that a better-functioning government requires better hiring.
BALDWIN: Whatever you were doing, your shtick. And then the next thing you know, a friend of mine, who was at NYU, her roommate was in the acting program. I went to visit my friend, and her roommate said, my God, you should audition for the program just for the hell of it. And I did. And I got in, and they gave me a need-based scholarship for the whole year there. And the joke in my family is that I called my parents, and my mother was apoplectic. I mean, she was screaming on the phone. What is wrong with you? And I said, I'm going to leave GW to go to NYU to study acting. And I said, now, Mom and Dad - I said, when I go back to New York as a returning New Yorker, I'm eligible for all of this financial aid that I lost when I left town. So when I went to D.C. - so actually, NYU was more expensive than GW, but it's going to cost you less money. And my father literally went, well, let's hear him out. Let's hear him out.

I think as a Democratic governor in a state like Pennsylvania that Tom Wolf has in many ways found a sweet spot, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College. Borick points to Wolf's two blowout wins in the state as evidence: he won 55 percent of the vote in 2014, and 58 percent four years later.
And there are also procedural moves that a committee chair can take, such as changing the bill significantly through an amendment, to stop a measure passing through a discharge resolution.
Mulvaney notified Shaub in a letter last week that the data call appears to raise legal questions regarding the scope of OGE's authorities. He said he wanted the data call put on hold until it is reviewed by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which advises the executive branch on constitutional questions and limits of executive power. The move could block the request for waivers indefinitely.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go home. Get a new job.
We're on a path to pass his bill, Graham told reporters. It's just a matter of when. It will be in this Congress, under a better process.
Kelly formally left the White House at the start of 2019, so is he the senior former adviser being quoted here? Or was the adviser someone who had heard the Pearl Harbor story from Kelly? Or did the Pearl Harbor story come from someone else entirely?
Costa Samaras, an engineer who studies climate change adaptation and resilience at Carnegie Mellon, said meeting the state's climate targets will be made harder by large additions of CO2, like petrochemical plants.
SIMON: Let me separate that out. What can the president do, say even this weekend - pardons, for example?
ADLER: There was no deal. So later that year, after signing a budget with automatic cuts if state revenues came in below projections, Brown again turned to Latin.
'Middle Class Joe' No More: Biden Earned $15 Million Since Leaving Office

NATAPOFF: I think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. One of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. Of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.
MARTIN: So it was a late night for all of us as we watched these returns come in. Big headline is that Joe Biden needed to do well. And he did, right?
GROSS: Do you think that if that was happening today, your mother would think, gee, is my child trans? Should I...
And so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.
Where would the Restore PA money go?
Somewhat more speculative are the thoughts indirectly attributed to former White House personnel such as Kelly, including Rex Tillerson (his first secretary of state), Jim Mattis (his first secretary of defense) and Don McGahn (his first White House counsel). All the above come off as valiant public servants who strove to be guardrails — to keep the president's rogue instincts in check – until they were fired or resigned.
But despite the high stakes, uncertainty looms over how much oil is actually trapped under the million acres of tundra up for leasing, and how much industry interest there is to go find it.
A Local Problem with a Global Solution
And a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.
MARTIN: We've got NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with us to explain. Hi, Rob.
At Mitch's Seafood, a restaurant in San Diego committed to local fish, the owners spent three years looking for a California-based squid processor for their calamari. They eventually found a company in San Pedro called Tri-Marine.
The Obama administration did formally accuse ISIS of carrying out a genocide against religious minorities, including Christians in Iraq and Syria. Offices at the State Department have been involved in the U.S. response, though this did not include putting Christians at the top of the line for the U.S. resettlement program.

AMY KLOBUCHAR: We've had a situation of the weather being bad. We've had some of the lowest profits for agriculture - at least in my state - since the 1980s. And I know that Iowa is experiencing this too. And while I'm glad that the administration decided to get that 12 billion set aside to make up for these trade wars, that's not the same as actually selling things, right?
From the perspective of voters, I think voters have a right to be furious right now, says Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, another group that has supported Medicaid expansion.
In the Senate, Majority Leader Jake Corman said the Senate doesn't plan to take up the Restore PA bill this month, reported Capitolwire, an online subscription-based news service.
We got the president into office and we expect results, Markham said. And we will make our voices known if that is not the case.
GROSS: That's Randy Rainbow. And if you want to see more of his videos, they're all on YouTube. And that was recorded December 11, 2017. And if you think that that song is hopelessly out of date because Roy Moore lost, consider that in June, Roy Moore announced he intends on running again for the Senate. So Sixteen Going On Seventeen seems like an obvious song choice to use for the Roy Moore story. But how did you make that connection in your mind? It seems obvious after somebody makes the connection for you, but how did you think of using that melody?
In terms of the Trump timeline, this book wraps up around the time the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being debated. Although special counsel Robert Mueller concludes the Russians did interfere in 2016 in hopes of helping Trump, his report does not find a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign itself. But Mueller also provided a list of occasions when Trump's actions could be seen as interfering with the investigation, adding that he could neither indict a sitting president nor say these actions were not indictable.
After the conference, Fox's Shepard Smith responded: Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano's commentary, apparently referring to the report Trump cited.
Many groups are calling on Biden to establish an Office of Young Americans within the White House and to appoint a director of youth engagement who will sit on the Domestic Policy Council.

Trump, meanwhile, was preoccupied with the release of President Barack Obama's college transcripts.
DANIELS: (As General Washington) And if God is with us, we'll take the whole lot of them.
I think we both had fear of what that would mean for our employment conditions, she explains, but also because we couldn't really admit to ourselves, I think, the level of commitment that we were making and the level of crazy life changes that were happening.
RAINBOW: Well, the first restaurant I worked in was Hooters.
We're asking the younger generations to stop going out in public places, to bars and restaurants, and spreading asymptomatic virus onto countertops and knobs and grocery stores and grocery carts, she said.
GROSS: So we've talked a little bit about how the misdemeanor system penalizes the poor more than people who have money because the poor can't afford to pay bail or fines or fees. What are the fees that you're referring to?
NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The test case comes from South Dakota, which passed a law requiring out-of-state companies, including online companies, to collect sales taxes. Today, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said that allowing online companies to avoid collecting sales taxes costs states billions of dollars in revenue and unfairly harms local small businesses who do have to add those taxes onto their prices.
Mnuchin said the plan also includes $300 billion for small-business loans. The loans are intended to be used for hiring and maintaining payroll and could be forgiven down the line.

Since Pennsylvania's natural gas boom began around 2008, there have been calls to implement a severance tax, but it's never happened. Why? As StateImpact Pennsylvania has reported, a lot of it comes down to the power of the natural gas lobby.
An analysis from the Tax Foundation found that those House Republican income tax brackets would provide tax cuts across the economic spectrum, but that the benefits would be much bigger for rich Americans. The top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes grow by 5.3 percent, while people below the 80th percentile would see little change, with their incomes growing by less than 1 percent (these figures do not take into account any additional economic effects the plan would have).
RIVERA: That they had much more than what they wanted, and they needed to unwind that.
Cohen did, however, allege that GOP political consultant Roger Stone phoned Trump to tell him that WikiLeaks intended to release a batch of emails that would embarrass the Democratic National Committee.
Along with jobs, Minott says the ethane cracker will be bringing something else to the region — a large carbon footprint.

And I think that contributed a lot to my musicality and my love for musical theater, for sure.
Wednesday is the deadline for health insurers to finalize rates for the 2018 individual market open enrollment season, which starts Nov. 1. Yet there has been no resolution to the question of whether the federal government will continue to reimburse insurers for subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions. Those are payments insurers are required to provide to moderate-income enrollees to help them afford deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The law says the federal government is supposed to make those payments, but a lawsuit has left that an open question, and the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to stop making the payments.
ELVING: Yes, he has already issued a slew of pardons. Many consider some of those to be unsavory, including for his former associates who had pled guilty to lying to the FBI and were about to be sentenced to prison. He has pardoned individuals who killed civilians in Iraq while on contract with the U.S. military. And there is a general expectation he will pardon members of his family and quite possibly himself while he still can, although the actual legal effect of a self-pardon has never been tried and remains very much a matter of debate.
Hess said when he ran DEP from 2001-2003, funding for the agency did not depend so much on permit fees. About half of DEP's current budget relies on those fees, while just 20 percent comes from the general fund, he said. Federal funds make up the rest. In the early 2000s, permit fees, general fund dollars and federal funds each contributed about one-third.
Cohen also made a number of other accusations against Trump:
He predicts that more than half of companies that can allow remote work will continue to, at least part time. And companies should think hard before being heavy-handed in ordering people back to the office from wherever they are now, he says. The good news is you could get everybody back in the office, he says. The bad news is ... not everybody is going to come back.
The petrochemical plant is itself a humongous emitter of greenhouse gases, Minott said.

Sixty-four-year-old Chris Petersen (ph) is a lifelong family farmer from Clear Lake, and he's a Democrat. He says the party needs to talk more about all of these things.
GROSS: Alexandra Natapoff, thank you so much for talking with us.
It is far from a done deal, but this morning after Super Tuesday, we're a lot closer to knowing who the 2020 Democratic nominee for president will be.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized the airline-specific loans as a blank check bailout that lacks protections for workers and consumers.
NATAPOFF: One of the startling things about our enormous misdemeanor system is just how unequal it is. It often goes after low income and impoverished individuals. It sweeps in people of color, often disproportionately, for order maintenance and other low-level offenses. One of the particularly burdensome and inegalitarian aspects of low-level offenses is the effect of imposing fines and fees on misdemeanor defendants.
People are concerned about it. They think about it. They're seeing it more in their lives, Borick said. But are they at the point where they're willing to go much more in? I don't know if we've reached that point. I think we're headed to that point, but I don't think we're there yet.
SIMON: What could he face as a private citizen?
He added that Congress will have future opportunities to address the long-term impact of the coronavirus crisis when it writes regular annual spending bills later in the year.
Yet there is something unsettling about the evolution of this genre. Is it purely a matter of Trump's excesses or has he occasioned a sea change in journalism as well? Is it all about Trump, or are we also witnessing a new set of standards for the presentation of a presidency — or of politics in general?
What Economists Say About Trade With Mexico
GEORGE ISAACSON: It would really be a wet blanket on the electronic commerce economy.
With an ethics waiver, a federal official is free to act on matters that normally would trigger concerns about conflicts of interest or other ethical problems. Federal regulations say the waivers generally should be made public on request. The Obama administration routinely posted waivers online. The Trump administration has issued an unknown number and released none.
Marzena Ermler, the career services manager at the New York Public Library, says she has been recommending census positions as a bridge job for some job seekers.
Trump, Pelosi Agree On Coronavirus Relief Bill. Next Hurdle: The Senate
The cuts have forced many groups to lay off workers just before open enrollment begins and to limit the areas they serve.
The president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.
And Wall Street corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes. That's why I support the so-called Buffett Rule, because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. We should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires, crack down on tax gaming by corporations, and close the carried interest loophole – something I've advocated for years. — Hillary Clinton
One area of stark disagreement between congressional Republicans and President Biden is relief for state and local governments. Republicans continue to argue it would reward states and cities that mismanaged their budgets. The White House has framed this part of the package as being about help for first responders. Richmond says cities that rely on the hospitality industry have been especially hard-hit, losing significant tax revenue.
Scholarship tax-credit programs, like voucher programs, send students to private schools. Their impact is hard to determine, says Harris of the Education Research Alliance.
On the campaign trail, Trump stressed this difference in beliefs in harsh terms, once saying, The German people are going to end up overthrowing this woman. I don't know what the hell she's thinking.

James Sherk, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, says using contractors is still preferable to hiring workers directly. He says because of unions and appeals processes, it's far too difficult to fire underperforming federal workers.

A federal judge in Virginia agreed on Monday to postpone the trial of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
Wolf has estimated that his proposed severance tax would bring in about $300 million more a year, on top of the impact fee.
NATAPOFF: I learned an enormous amount from the people that I represented in Baltimore - listening to their stories, meeting them and their families and hearing how they grappled with the challenges of facing a low-level misdemeanor charge. And I learned that often the calculus of punishment doesn't necessarily shake out the way you would think.
We very often see a lot of mature job seekers who are transitioning from one career to another, explains Ermler, who is based at the Science, Industry and Business Library in Manhattan. They, for whatever reason, are laid off, other jobs are over, and they need that quick access to cash.
ADLER: Brown would also sprinkle in little quips when speaking off the cuff. For example, in September of 2011, as he was slogging through hundreds of bills on his desk...
The lack of broadband hurts people's access to business, schools and healthcare — and he said once autonomous vehicles become a reality, areas without broadband won't have them.
NATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.
GROSS: So you grew up in Massapequa, Long Island, and - you point out - not the affluent part. There were two high schools. Your father taught at the one where the more prosperous families sent their kids, and you went to the other one. Your father taught history and economics. He coached football and riflery. He chaperoned dances, supervised weekend recreation programs, directed one of the school district's summer camp programs. And you say he was strict with you because he'd seen what happens to kids who go off the track and who start drinking or using drugs. So in what way was he strict with you?
Mnuchin met with lawmakers Tuesday to discuss details of the administration's proposal. He said Trump wants to start sending out checks within the next two weeks, though it was not immediately clear whether that would be possible or how it would work.
The NRA had already canceled its annual meeting, set to take place in Nashville, Tenn., because of the coronavirus.
Our squid is a learning curve, Pleschner-Steele says. If you overcook it, it can taste like a rubber band. But in my opinion, if you do it right, it tastes more like abalone than any other squid. It's nutty, sweet and delicate.
Baldwin is nominated for an Emmy for playing the president on SNL. In 2017, he told Fresh Air that he plays the character in a exaggerated way: It's kind of the Macy's Day Parade [version] of Trump.
Most people don't know the open enrollment dates, and they don't know that the deadline this year is Dec. 15, not Jan. 31, like last year, wrote Lori Lodes, who ran outreach for the ACA in the Obama administration, in a recent op-ed for Vox.
Next we are told: Kelly was momentarily stunned. Trump had heard the phrase 'Pearl Harbor' and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else.
NATAPOFF: I think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. And that's a matter for democratic debate. We will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. And then the American public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the leasing program could generate a windfall of $1.8 billion over a decade, to be split between Alaska and the federal government.
Any of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits. With each passing year of inaction, though, the gap to be filled gets larger.
This president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it.
You can buy an annuity in two forms: an immediate or deferred. Both forms protect you from outliving your retirement savings. An immediate annuity means that you pay a lump-sum amount of cash, usually at retirement, and immediately start receiving annuity payments. A deferred annuity means that you pay for it, often while working, long before you start receiving annuity payments. Due to recent legal changes, you'll soon be allowed to buy deferred annuities through 401(k) plans.
The bill proposal comes a day after two members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 and President Trump signed a second relief bill that provides paid sick leave, expanded unemployment assistance and resources for testing.
ELVING: We are not likely to see the 25th Amendment, Scott. It's never been used except for a matter of hours for medical situations. And resignation would not seem to be in President Trump's nature. So unless Vice President Pence decides to push for it, there does not seem to be enough motivation within the Cabinet to remove him using the 25th Amendment.
RAINBOW: Well, it was hard. I mean, it was - it made things very uncomfortable in my home and - you know, which is why I was locked in my room, making videos with my Barbie dolls.

Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller has charged Manafort with alleged tax fraud and money laundering connected to the work he once did for clients in Ukraine.
So there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.
They're caught up in a system that's using misdemeanor arrest and using misdemeanor processing in unfair and dysfunctional ways. And I think there is a lot of room in our misdemeanor system to scale back those practices so that we can concentrate on misdemeanors that cause real harm - the drunk driving and the assaults and the domestic violence that require our attention and make our misdemeanor system more truly effective and a better deterrent.
But before this week, Trump repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the average flu. And in early March, Trump said he did not think it was inevitable that the coronavirus would spread across the country, contradicting health officials at the time.

LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Long before Maria you probably knew Puerto Rico was in financial trouble. The story went something like this - Puerto Rico borrowed way too much money over the years, overspent that money, and now it can't pay any of it back. And then there was this other story that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their savings. But what hasn't made much sense is what one thing had to do with the other.
GROSS: So your book is, in part, about the inequality of the misdemeanor system and how it's racially unequal and there's a class system within the misdemeanor system. So I don't know what kind of income the woman who was arrested for the seatbelt violation had, but what are the differences in how that might've been handled between a person who had money and a person who didn't?
In 1967 and again in 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that companies don't have to collect sales taxes for out-of-state purchases. That was before the Internet revolutionized the economy. This year, the high court decided to revisit the issue. And today, contrary to expectations, a narrow majority of justices signaled they may not be willing to disturb the status quo.

Voters wanted Medicaid expansion and that's what we're doing, says Republican state Sen. Allen Christensen. But, he adds, the voters didn't fill in the proper blanks. We are filling in those blanks for them. They are not obligated to balance the budget. We are.
JENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.
More than 80 percent of U.S. squid landings are exported — most of it to China. The rare percentage of that catch that stays domestically goes to Asian fresh fish markets or is used as bait.

In the state Senate, two Republicans from southwestern Pennsylvania have proposed what they call an alternative way of paying for important infrastructure projects:
A freeze is not unprecedented. Other administrations — Democrat and Republican — have used them. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used a host of measures to reduce the size of the federal workforce.
Biden, Harris Promise 'Help Is On The Way' With COVID Relief Package
Older readers may recoil from much of this assessment — not only because the behavior described is repellent, but also because its depiction in such relentlessly damning detail is disturbing. People naturally ask: How much of this can be true?
The bill allows for people to defer payments on federal student loans and allows students whose universities have canceled classes to keep Pell Grants.
I know eventually the government is going to have to get it together, and I know that they're going to want this 2020 census to go forward, she says.
GROSS: So how did you match Trump's second meeting with Kim Jong Un with I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy? How did those two things come together in your mind?
Rucker and Leonnig's mission is manifest in their title, a sarcastic jab at one of Trump's more memorable moments of self-congratulation. Accused of being either unthinking or unstable, Trump at the time denied being either. He was, he said, a very stable genius. Whether the president meant that with a touch of self-deprecating humor or not, it functions here as the epitome of self-delusion.
GONYEA: When Amy Klobuchar, who's from neighboring Minnesota, took the stage, she said anti-trust laws need to be rewritten to protect small farms. She talked about President Trump's trade policies, tariffs he imposed against China and the retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese on U.S. farm commodities.
The new tax is in line with what the government currently charges all corporations that earn more than 20 billion won ($18.7 million) per year.
COSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.
It's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.
Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods say they won't sell guns to customers under 21, and both are putting new restrictions on ammunition sales.
He and his partner signed a two-year lease, even though Benji's employer, a large health insurance company, hasn't given him permission to work remotely permanently.
Trump, for example, said he would walk away if a renegotiation of NAFTA didn't turn out the way he wanted. And as he later added: Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. He also warned that the Trans Pacific Partnership would mean a million lost manufacturing jobs.
Heat can be deadly for the elderly. Does the pain felt by a laid-off Carrier worker cancel out the relief felt by an 80-year-old Mississippian who finally can afford an air-conditioned bedroom?
Put another way — that would be the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of the state's carbon dioxide budget of 58 million tons of CO2 in the state's 2050 climate target.
An annuity can be a very smart retirement investment for many people. That's not just because an annuity can provide a secure revenue stream — a monthly check — for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. On top of that, the longer you live, the more you get what's called a mortality credit as you outlive other people who bought into the annuity. The income gain from that can be many times greater than any other secure investment you're likely to find.
I think there's just a lot of education clearly that needs to be done about who holds student debt, about the impact of student debt, said Audelo. I was hoping we were in a more positive place but then the town hall response was like, 'OK cool, we're like 15 years behind.'
In his address, Wolf talked about using funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program among Northeast states aimed at addressing climate change, to help fund environmental protection.
Slonaker says changing the scope of Prop. 3 would mean fewer people getting health coverage, and the state would receive less money from the federal government. He also fears it could make voters feel disillusioned.
Hillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. — Donald Trump

While some activists say they appreciate having open lines of communication with the administration, including at its highest levels, they do not plan to stop asserting public pressure on the administration from the outside.
They're not alone in making big moves during the pandemic. With millions of Americans suddenly working remotely, some took the unprecedented opportunity to shift their lives in a new direction — crossing their fingers that when it's safe to go back to the office, they won't have to.
SHAPIRO: And a lot of people have noted that the deciding vote here was cast by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, joining with the more liberal justices. Can we draw any conclusions from that?
A pay reduction is expected for LaPierre, but it is unclear by how much.
SULLIVAN: Capacete said he said that was all great until about 2011, when he and other bankers started realizing what many bond investors hadn't yet figured out - Puerto Rico was in trouble. There was too much debt. And this is where you might expect UBS and other banks to stop with the bond deals, stop pitching Puerto Rico bonds and stop selling Puerto Rican bonds to their clients. But the opposite happened. Capacete said when it came to clients, UBS pushed brokers to sell.
Mnuchin emphasized that banks and markets would remain open and that Americans would be able to access their money and stocks. We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that's something they need to do, he said.
Instead, in Zoom meetings and conference calls, the Biden White House is making its pitch to governors and mayors, county executives and state treasurers and secretaries of state, agriculture associations and labor unions, progressive groups and faith leaders.
There is a lot to be ironed out to make sports betting lucrative — from state taxes in other places to whether the leagues get a cut of the bets.
'We don't know very much about this area'
In 2010, as the Tea Party rose up, many anti-establishment Republicans started turning against trade. Business-oriented Republicans (think: Chamber of Commerce) were still very much in favor of trade, but the split with older, blue-collar conservatives was widening.
The proposal was drafted by Senate Republicans and the Trump administration. The bill still needs to be negotiated with Senate Democrats, which McConnell said would happen Friday. Already some Democrats were criticizing the plan as too focused on help for corporations and were calling for major changes.
In a statement, the White House said President Biden, who proposed the $15 minimum wage as part of his American Recue Plan, is disappointed but that he urges Congress to move quickly to pass the relief. It also said he will work with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward.
TOTENBERG: But George Isaacson, representing Wayfair, countered that reversing the old decisions would force compliance with 12,000 state and local tax rules across the country and would be so expensive it would drive small companies and startups out of business.
Taxes paid: $29,170, or 13.6% rate
One example sure to be much discussed is an anecdote from Trump's 2017 trip to Asia, which involved a stopover in Hawaii and a tour of Pearl Harbor. The authors relate how, while en route to the memorial for U.S. service members killed in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that brought the U.S. into World War II, Trump pulled [Chief of Staff John] Kelly aside for a quick consult.
KLEINBARD: Exactly. But there is one other thing going on, which is that the U.S. Treasury Department is smarter than this. The U.S. Treasury Department put out a large policy paper last week in which it came to the defense of Apple, and in part it's because of just political - the same kind of political considerations. But it's also because there's a tax agenda underneath the surface.
And shortly after Trump's election, Merkel offered a rebuttal of her own in a tepid note of congratulations, taking the opportunity to state:

Natapoff is a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. From 2000 to 2003, she was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. She drew on those experiences for the book, but it's also based on extensive data she collected from every state around the country and on interviews with people who've gone through the misdemeanor process, as well as police, prosecutors, public defenders and judges.
GROSS: I want to switch topics to an earlier book that you wrote, a 2009 book called Snitching: Criminal Informants And The Erosion Of American Justice. And this book was about the government's use of criminal suspects and criminal defendants to get information in exchange for deals to get, you know, somebody to talk or to, you know, name another person who is guilty of something in return for leniency for the informant's crimes. What do you think is the problem with that kind of approach?
The ethics waivers are supposed to be public documents, but the administration so far has not released them. An anti-Trump legal group, American Oversight, sued eight federal departments and agencies on Monday, arguing that ethics waivers should be released under the Freedom of Information Act. American Oversight had previously filed FOIA requests.
LIASSON: Presidents' budgets are always political documents. They're not a piece of legislation, but they do express the president's priorities. And, of course, the cliche is to say that the president's budget is dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. This one is probably dead as a doornail. And the reason is that Republicans and Democrats just passed a massive, two-year spending bill, which raises the caps for domestic and defense spending. And the White House was mostly a bystander in those negotiations. So what the president says in his budget tomorrow will not affect spending very much. Congress probably won't be passing a 2019 budget resolution. The bottom line is, in this instance, Congress seems to be ignoring the president.

Finally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test.

Biden has vowed to try to unite the country, and has said addressing the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus is his top priority is a big part of that. But constrained by the pandemic, Biden hasn't yet been able to make the case for his plan by taking it on the road to rallies or even kitchen table photo ops, in the way that presidents typically have made large legislative pushes.
NPR reporters Scott Detrow, Carrie Johnson, Ryan Lucas, Tim Mak and Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.
Trump said he wants Congress to push through a major comprehensive package to help businesses and workers facing hardships — one of many abrupt shifts the administration has made this week as the scope of the pandemic has come into sharp focus.

Jail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.

In 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.
It's true that 99 percent of the 12,587 refugees from Syria admitted in 2016 to the U.S. were Muslim and less than 1 percent were Christian.

With the civil war going on and the millions who have been displaced, it's nearly impossible to tell exactly what the most current percentages are.

Trump's child care plan focuses on allowing families to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. That was immediately panned this week as largely benefiting richer Americans — higher earners pay higher tax rates, and many lower-and-middle-income households don't pay any federal income tax. Trump's campaign added that they would also have a plan for those lower-income households, allowing them to exclude child care expenses from half their payroll taxes.
LIASSON: But now she's splitting the left lane of the party with Bernie Sanders. Is that what she wants? Or will she drop out and endorse him? No one knows.

And it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.
NATAPOFF: The purpose of bail is supposed to be to ensure that people appear for court when they're charged with an offense. When people are charged with an offense, they're, of course, presumptively innocent. They haven't been convicted of anything. So bail has nothing to do with whether anyone is guilty or innocent. It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.

We need to dial back this enormous, bloated misdemeanor system. We need to dial back arrests. We need to dial back incarceration. We need to dial back the penalties and the use of debtors' prison so that the misdemeanor system can do its job, so that it can go after crime and low-level offenses in a meaningful way and impose punishments that are not so wildly disproportionate to the crime.

The issue is that other lawyers at Mueller's former law firm represent presidential daughter Ivanka Trump; her husband, Jared Kushner; and onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Mueller never worked for those clients, but under ethics law he still could require a waiver for his new job. It's worth noting that while the White House suggests conflicts for Mueller, it obtained an ethics agreement for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He needed it because, in his previous job as Oklahoma attorney general, he was a plaintiff in several lawsuits challenging EPA regulations.

She just didn't want us in the house so she wouldn't lose her marbles. And - but when I was a little boy and I lay in bed next to my mother, my mother would be sleeping.

Some of that has paid off. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urged quick action on the president's plan in a letter to Congress that had so many signatories it ran 11 pages long. State and local governments stand to benefit from the Biden plan, which calls for an infusion of $350 billion to offset pandemic-related losses and expenses.

RON ELVING, BYLINE: The first time the words Washington, Christmas and crisis all came together in our history was our first December together as a nation, 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence and the full-scale outbreak of the Revolutionary War.
We just don't think they're giving enough, Trump said. We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country.
Plastics build-out could conflict with governor's climate goals
Congressional Republicans say the package is too large and payments should be targeted to people who really need it. In a letter to Biden on Thursday, 10 GOP senators who had met with him noted some of the money appropriated in previous relief packages hasn't yet been spent. It highlights a gulf that will make it difficult to pass a bill that is bipartisan by any traditional definition.
Census workers will play a critical role to make sure people who don't fill out a census form themselves by mail, phone or online get counted. Fewer than seven in 10 householders plan to take part in the census, according to a new report commissioned by the Census Bureau.
CAPACETE: It's unethical. It's against the bank's regulations. And it puts the clients in a really, really tough risk situation.
BROWN: I'm not here to make news. I'm here to enlighten you.
It's also earned him praise from the natural gas industry, which has successfully resisted Wolf's main request of it — a severance tax on gas production. The industry says it already contributes to the state coffers through an impact fee— which in 2018 brought in $251 million.
But Wolf has maintained that natural gas, while not perfect, can be done better. He's proposed a severance tax on gas, and rules to limit methane leaks at wells and tightening other drilling regulations.
We have long relied on front-line reporters from the most prominent news organizations to write books about the powerful figures they once covered. Such books have always trafficked in insider knowledge and insights gleaned from hours spent close to the flame of political power.
And prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. It was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. There are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.
As of Sunday, though, the Senate will no longer be able to pass a health law overhaul bill with only a simple majority. That means the bill is effectively dead, for now.
Voter registration would be made easier. Citizens could register online or get registered automatically, via data from driver's licenses or other government sources. For federal elections, states would have to provide same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Election Day would be a federal holiday.
Based on an NPR analysis of data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara over the past three administrations, the president has fielded questions from reporters on average about every 15 days.
Like Barrientos, he says that if Mexico is going to successfully combat diabetes, the rules of the game need to change.
In response to concerns about wildlife, as well as oil industry interest, the Bureau of Land Management recently removed nearly a third of the original 1.6 million acres from the sale. Geologist Houseknect says those areas do not have high potential for oil.

They're cut from a very similar cloth, he said. When you hear them speak, they don't sound like some of these other candidates that are getting the national headlines because of their strident liberal positions, but rather they seem like common-sense, problem-solving Democrats.

He would, like, look at me and say - where are you going to go? I'd say, I'm going to go to my friend Jeff's house. He goes, what are you guys going to do? Did you leave the phone number with your mother? And everything was very calm and very officious. And then at the end he'd say, what time are you going to come home? I'd say, I'm going to be home at 10:30. And I'm tense the whole time. I mean, like, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop. He'd lean in and press his finger into my shoulder. And he'd say, if you're not back at this house at 10:30, I'm going to break every bone in your body. Do you understand me? And I was like, yes, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God. Yes.
RAINBOW: I often think of that, and I don't know. She very well might. And I think of that because I was an effeminate kid and - but I don't necessarily think - you know, I know I'm not trans. I don't feel - I don't think I ever felt that I was trapped in the wrong body. But yeah, I think that the lines are a little blurred now, and people are still kind of figuring those things out. I hear directly from parents all the time who have those questions.

But Paul Light, a public policy professor at New York University, says adding in federal contractors and grantees brings that number up to between 7 million and 9 million.
SULLIVAN: UBS declined NPR and FRONTLINE's requests for an interview but said its loan terms were fully disclosed, and that the program as a whole did not violate financial regulations. It pointed to a separate case where regulators found it didn't mislead clients and called Capacete a disgruntled former employee who has sued the bank, and said it fired the one employee who had been violating policies.
SULLIVAN: Why do you think the bank would want to turn a blind eye to something like this?

People with incomes under $2,500 would be eligible for $600, or $1,200 for a married couple.
Those cuts had to be backfilled by permit fee increases, Hess said. Those kinds of fee increases were unsustainable.
Walking just outside his office in Mexico City, he points out little shops selling Coke and junk food on just about every block. In fact, the red Coca-Cola logo has become a symbol that declares snack shop.
The cost of labor is another, perhaps more significant, factor. Squid cleaning and processing is an extremely time-consuming practice. The eyes, cartilage, skin and guts need to be removed ahead of time, and it's cheaper to have this done overseas than domestically.
Houseknecht says geologists don't know more about the coastal plain's oil potential because it wasn't until late 2017 that Congress decided to allow drilling there, after decades of debate.
Have you learned a lot about writing lyrics from doing this? What I mean is, like, you're patterning your lyrics on some of the best lyricists who've ever written for the stage. And you're frequently following their rhyme schemes, which are sometimes pretty complicated, depending on whose work you're doing. But have you learned a lot from using the greatest lyricists' work as your template to write your own lyrics?
Or, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.
It's not just undocumented people that are clamoring for a different direction on immigration. It's millions of people that went out to vote and people are super clear that deportations and enforcement and detention is not the pathway that the majority of American voters want to go, and that's why they chose Joe Biden, Martinez said. What we know for sure is that we can't leave 2021 without any protection for people.
So the consequences of a misdemeanor conviction are far from petty, even though the conversation around misdemeanors, you know, really doesn't appreciate the impact that they impose.

Lorin Maazel conducts the New York Philharmonic 'cause I'm helping to sell the product.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Thanks, Nina.
SIMON: Donald Trump has little more than a week left in office. Senator Murkowski of Alaska called on him to resign yesterday. Democrats in the House are working up articles of impeachment. There has been talk about the 25th Amendment being invoked. Any chance any of these efforts may succeed before President Trump does one or more of the things that they fear he might?
I was heartened to hear the governor address the need for stronger laws to ensure pipeline public and environmental safety, Dinniman said in a statement. Many of the points he made echoed what I and others have been calling for over the past six years here in Chester County and Harrisburg.
'I Know What Mr. Trump Is'
Cohen also described Trump telling him to call a reporter for Forbes magazine to argue about his wealth in its ranking one year.
This might be the first time someone convicted of lying to Congress has appeared again so quickly in front of Congress, said the oversight committee's ranking member, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Certainly it's the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star witness.
As for what he would do, in that seven-point trade plan he said he would label China a currency manipulator (people accuse China of manipulating its currency's value to exports cheap, meaning other countries' consumers would buy more), crack down on intellectual property theft, and impose tariffs on countries that cheat.
At times, this mixed methodology presents real problems. We are told many things that some critics or some in the White House or former officials have told the authors. Without questioning the legitimacy of these quotations, can we rely upon them the same way we would trust direct attributions?
STEIN: Yeah. That's right. That's one of the reasons scientists are so excited about this. You know, there are many other diseases where you really can't treat them by taking cells out of their body and editing them and putting them back in. And the only way to get to the cells that need to be fixed, you know, for brain diseases like Huntington's disease, maybe some inherited forms of dementia, muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy, is to edit from the inside instead of from the outside.
SHAPIRA: The lavish shopping atrium inside will feature expensive boutiques from international designers.

Biden, as well as his pick for Interior Secretary — Rep. Deb Haaland — oppose drilling in the refuge. The hand-off of drilling rights to the highest bidders could make it more difficult to reverse course.
Several Hill Republicans said they were worried that the latest version of the bill was bloated and were unwilling to make a final call on their support until the text is released.
Under federal regulations, OGE is supposed to oversee all waiver decisions throughout the government.
What is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.
Democrats control the levers of power in Washington with Joe Biden as the party leader, said Jesse Barba, a spokesman for Young Invincibles. And with it, they are having to own the outcome of how young people will weather the economic and health storms of the last four years.
I not only share their progressive values of things we've fought so hard for over the years, Kopser told KXAN-TV, but doing that in a way that will allow independents and those orphaned Republicans who are just so estranged by their party today — they don't even recognize the Texas Republicans of today – to be able to say, 'You know what, we want calm out of the chaos.'
STEIN: He said it's really exciting, and he's looking forward to see what happens next.

The budget includes a natural gas severance tax to fund Restore PA, a set of infrastructure projects. It's the sixth time Wolf has introduced a severance tax, which has been blocked by the Republican legislature.
Barrientos says current projections show that by 2030, 17 percent of all Mexican adults will have diabetes.
We — the U.S. taxpayers — help subsidize farmers by paying part of the premiums on their crop insurance. This helps ensure that farmers don't go belly up, and it also protects against food shortages.
The Bidens' adjusted gross income for 2018 was $4.5 million. It was even higher — $11 million – in 2017. They have paid a federal tax rate of just over 33% each year.
The one thing that keeps me up at night is the one thing I have less control over, and that's our ability to recruit and hire, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, explained during a public meeting last year.
If incoming President Donald Trump wants to reduce the size of the federal workforce, what he should really do is decide which programs he wants to cut or eliminate, says Cato Institute tax policy director Chris Edwards.
And unavoidably with business comes the question of trade. At the news conference, Merkel praised international trade agreements, saying they work best when they work as a win-win for the parties involved.
California Says Goodbye To Jerry Brown, State's Longest-Serving Governor
Opponents have also filed multiple lawsuits seeking to block drilling. They've raised concerns about its impacts on Indigenous people, the global climate, and wildlife, including the caribou that give birth in the coastal plain and the polar bears that den there. Even if leases are sold, legal experts say it's possible that courts could later cancel them.
To help explain this, we called on Kent Smetters, an economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He's an expert on personal finance and he's written extensively about annuities in particular.
But anyway, so we did that. And he was always straining to find a stronger, better word in his language and never found it. So you'd have him pause. You know, Trump is always in there going, you know, (imitating Donald Trump) the people that I work with, they're just really, really the most fantastic people. They're fantastic.

Later on the same page, we have one senior former adviser adding that Trump was at times dangerously uninformed.
1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't run out of money in 20 years. What will happen — somewhere around 2035 — is the program will exhaust its Trust Fund, which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)
So, you know, you've mentioned that a lot of songwriters like your work. I know a lot of Broadway people love your work. What about President Trump and Vice President Pence? Have they ever commented...
LIASSON: No, because it's not a winner-take-all system the way the Republicans have. There's a 15% threshold. You don't get any delegates unless you get over 15% of the popular vote. If no one else gets 15%, then you can take all the delegates or a huge amount of the delegates - a bigger percentage of the delegates than the percentage of the popular vote that you got. But if a lot of other candidates get over 15%, then the winner of the state ends up taking a smaller percentage of the delegates than the percentage they got of the popular vote. That's why it's very important to see the final delegate totals.

But in 2013, the party came to an end for investors. Bond prices tanked. All of those tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans tied up in the same risky funds were in serious trouble, and those that had taken out additional loans suddenly had to cover them. Within months, billions of dollars of Puerto Rican wealth was wiped out.
First, charter schools. Charter students in city centers tend to do better than their public-school peers, according to the most recent research by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford. But charter students elsewhere tend to do the same or worse.
Local elected officials see up close how the pandemic has ravaged their communities, said Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman who is now one of Biden's top aides at the White House, in charge of the Office of Public Engagement.
Ward says states like his also can take advantage of savings, because Medicaid expansion makes providing health care to certain groups, like prisoners, more affordable. While states do have to pay 10 percent of the cost of expanded Medicaid (the federal government covers 90 percent — a more generous match than traditional Medicaid), the combination of savings and economic growth meant that, in the case of Montana, the program basically pays for itself, Ward says.
SHAPIRA: Also moving in is the building's namesake, 37-year-old whiz kid developer Donald Trump. Trump is on his way to building himself a real estate empire in New York, but not without controversy. In 1973, the developer was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent to blacks. Trump is also known for making lucrative deals with New York state and for making massive political contribution. Now, Trump is fighting the city for a $50 million tax abatement for his tower, saying this Kasbah for sheiks and movie stars will provide a public benefit because it's a mixed-use building with boutiques and office space. The city has twice ruled against tax abatements for Trump Tower. Trump responded by suing the housing commissioner for $138 million.
President Trump was reticent about the deal until the last moment, but he intends to sign the legislation when it reaches him, according to a source familiar with the White House's plans.

Still, you don't have to be a Trump loyalist to feel the authors have chosen only the incidents and eruptions that cast Trump in the most unfavorable light, a style reminiscent of the muckraking journalists of a century ago. Those who wish to see Trump's offenses balanced against his tax-and-regulation cuts or hear encomiums to his transformation of the federal judiciary will need to look elsewhere.

Yesterday, right after we recorded our interview, his YouTube series of satirical songs was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series. Let's start with one of his songs that borrows the melody from My Favorite Things.

Polls generally have reflected bipartisan support for trade over many years. In 2000, Gallup found that most respondents said increasing trade with China would help. And such support held up until the recession, when, as a December 2008 poll showed, Americans became more skeptical about trade.

It was early morning last September 20 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In the months that followed, we've heard a lot about how the storm crippled the island, leaving millions without power, food and water. Now, over the next two days, we're going to take a deeper look at where things went wrong before and after the storm. NPR and the PBS show FRONTLINE have spent the last seven months investigating, and today they reveal a disaster that began long before Maria, a decade of Wall Street dealing that made millions for banks while the island teetered on the edge of financial collapse.

When Tom Wolf first ran for governor in 2014, he called for a severance tax on natural gas drilling. After he was elected, he pushed for one in every budget — without success.
Gov. Mark Dayton, a former Democratic senator, said in a letter to Price that we have now been informed that Minnesota would lose more federal Basic Health Plan funding than we would receive in federal support for reinsurance, and described the entire waiver process as nightmarish.
One of the activists involved in that discussion was Max Markham, the policy director for March For Our Lives, the group was founded by survivors of the deadly 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. He says he and his colleagues have been heartened by some of the conversations with the administration.
Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed
RANDY RAINBOW: Thank you so much for joining me, Mr. President. I hope you have been enjoying the holiday season so far.
Later, he held a victory rally in Wisconsin.
GROSS: So I know Sondheim, one of your favorite lyricists, loves puzzles. But you loved puzzles, too, as a kid, right?
In contrast, a variable annuity is a very complicated product and, as commonly used, provides very little, if any, longevity protection. Instead, variable annuity sellers tout their tax benefits, but these benefits are often overstated and can even lead to higher taxes in some circumstances.
Wolf is also calling on lawmakers to enact a $1 per ton increase in tipping fees for municipal waste landfill deposits as a way to support the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. The fund is expected to become insolvent by the end of this year, the Wolf administration said, and the governor says increased tipping fees would generate an additional $22.6 million. That could help with any cleanup associated with emerging PFAS contamination.
GROSS: Yeah, Picture For A Sunday Afternoon. And then you explain in your book that you bonded with your father watching, like, the late-night old movies on TV and you bonded with your mother when you faked being sick and stayed home from school and watched daytime TV with her.
TRUMP: He likes me. I like him. Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him?
RAINBOW: Brutal dictators and cold-hearted liars (singing) tyrants and traitors and climate deniers, $5 spray tans with under-eye rings - these are a few of your favorite things. Burying tax returns after you file them, tear-gassing migrants for seeking asylum, big fat a** buckets of fried chicken wings - these are a few of your favorite things.
FACT CHECK: Trump's Tweets On Christians, ISIS And Vetting Miss The Bigger Picture
And they were stopped by a police officer, Turek, who pulled them over and hollered at Gail Atwater that she would be arrested for the seatbelt violation for not having her children in the seatbelt restraints. Her children started to cry. Ms. Atwater asked if she could take her kids to the neighbor's house. Officer Turek said, no, they're going to come to jail with you. A neighbor happened to walk by and take care of the kids, but Gail Atwater went to jail.
Imagine, for a moment, a high-octane courtroom prosecutor summing up for the jury a case built on the vivid testimony of multiple eyewitnesses.
If something opens up in Texas, Olson says, I feel like I would be doing a bit more sports betting just year-round. Not just here in Vegas.
Close the private sale and gun show loopholes that waive background checks
If you can afford to live well without the income from the immediate annuity, you are better off with the deferred annuity because it provides greater tax benefits and increased longevity protection.
Normally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.
LIBERACE: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Appearing on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, Trump's future White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said things like the weekly radio address, or even the daily briefing by the press secretary — where members of the media are allowed to question the administration on policy and topics of the day — could change under Trump.
These kinds of family friendly policies have been at the center of Clinton's campaign throughout this election season. Though Trump is venturing into this territory, she seemed to be saying that she owns this policy area far more than he does.
I'm not against the use of criminal informant deals in a system where we have already made the decision to negotiate. We live in a world of plea bargaining. And sometimes, it's worth cutting a deal with a terrible person in order to advance public safety and advance justice.
So you were in, like, your mid-30s when people started to really know you. Did you think, like, it wasn't going to happen; that you weren't going to have the career you wanted; that you'd be doing, like, other jobs, you know, and then, you know, moonlighting with things that you wanted to do?
Asked about the potential for pushback among gun rights advocates, Stack acknowledged the move isn't going to make everyone happy. But when we look at what those kids and the parents and the heroes in the school, what they did, our view was: If the kids can be brave enough to organize like this, we can be brave enough to get these [firearms] out of here.
Environmental organizations and some tribal groups have been lobbying oil companies, banks and other financial institutions to stay away from developing the refuge. A number of major banks say they won't fund oil projects in the Arctic.
By comparison, Vermont. Sen Bernie Sanders earned $561,293 last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris reported $1,884,319. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took in $846,394, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported $152,643.
Fordham also said it was a moot point because it was bound by federal law, and that we could/would not reveal/share any records (as we would not reveal any student records) with anyone except Mr. Trump himself, or any recipient he designated, in writing.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attended, alongside a number of Democratic House and Senate committee chairs. Both Pelosi and Schumer praised committee leaders and members of their caucuses for getting the legislation passed, with Pelosi referring to House committee chairs as dazzling.
Most states have programs that will guarantee your annuity payments if you insurer (the company that sold you the annuity) goes bust. The insurer cannot legally discuss these programs with you, and so you must investigate your own state rules. However, I don't have great confidence in these guarantees. Still, the risk of outliving your assets is much larger than the risk of you losing money because a major insurance company that sold you an annuity goes bankrupt. And you can reduce your risk by purchasing multiple annuity contracts across several companies.
He says when voters in Colorado were considering legal marijuana, some of them thought that this was going to be a huge amount of money for education.

The idea that our agriculture policies may undermine the health of Americans has been gaining traction. Consider this: The U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of farm subsidies to support the research, production and marketing of fruits and vegetables, according to this editorial penned jointly by former New York Times columnist Mark Bittman, food writer Michael Pollan, and Ricardo Salvador of the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2014.
GROSS: Yeah. This starts with you interviewing President Trump - again, taking Trump answers and inserting your own questions. And it starts with a little, like, take off of The Bachelor. So let's hear Randy Rainbow, He's In Love (And We're All Gonna Die).
GROSS: (Laughter) Haven't gotten that far yet?
BALDWIN: I would hang out with them, and they'd say, oh, you're so funny. And, you're so cheery.
There also were concerns among some GOP lawmakers that President Trump has not explicitly embraced the legislation, potentially leaving Republicans open to attacks if they voted for something Trump did not support.
RAINBOW: Oh, God. They were real classics, real gems.
CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who meticulously tracks the activities of the president, says the longest drought between press conferences for President George W. Bush was 82 days, while the longest President Obama went without a press conference was 86.
(The Wolf administration created the below map of community endorsements.)
In 2017, the GOP-led state Senate also approved a modest severance tax. It did not advance in the Republican-controlled House.
In an effort to reduce soda consumption, the government in 2014 imposed a 1 peso per liter tax on sugar sweetened beverages, the equivalent of about 10 U.S. cents on a standard 2 liter bottle.
GROSS: So she was quoted in The Washington Post as saying she knew that you were gay when you were 3.
Trump declared a national emergency related to the pandemic in a press conference on Friday afternoon at the White House.
Kate Ray and her husband, David, had just moved into a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Denver last March.
Trump's 15 percent plan may have an unintended consequence, however; he would apply that rate to pass-through business income, which is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent. That benefits the owners of certain types of businesses, allowing them to drastically cut their tax bills, and could encourage people to avoid taxes by changing how they report their earnings.
You mentioned that fees and fines are used to fund things. And by things, do you mean, like, to fund cities and counties and municipalities - that those funds go into funding the system? So in that sense, kind of like traffic tickets, they're an important part of fundraising for the budget.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (2018 return)
The FDA confirmed to NPR that it has received and processed Gilead's request.
Wolf said Energize PA wouldn't raise the $4.5 billion dollars that his plan would.
ELVING: The Pentagon will only say that she called and a conversation took place. But Pelosi was clearly shaken by Wednesday's traumatic events, and she is deeply concerned about what else Trump or perhaps some of his followers might be capable of in these final days.
SHAPIRO: Oh, so if this is revenue that has been taxed in Europe according to this court ruling, then it is revenue that the U.S. cannot someday in the future tax once this reform gets implemented.
Alexandra Natapoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a precedent-setting case from 1997 in which a mother was driving with her 3 and 5-year-old children in the car, and she was arrested for a seatbelt violation. Describe what she was arrested for.
1) For an annuity to make sense, you should ideally have saved up in excess of $500,000 in today's dollars for retirement. That's because $250,000 is the amount a couple retiring today should have ready for out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they are on Medicare, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and NetBenefits. The other $250,000 is a cushion for other things that might come up.

In recent years, he says, USGS had the 1980s seismic data commercially reanalyzed and planned to use it for a new oil assessment. But after the opening of the refuge three years ago the Interior Department called off the work without providing a reason why.
NATAPOFF: So there's some big, famous problems with the use of criminal informants. One is wrongful conviction. Informants often lie in order to get a deal. Informants also often continue to commit their own crimes. They get a kind of impunity from cooperating with the government. A lot of it is very secretive, so it's a kind of off-the-record aspect - big off-the-record aspect of the criminal justice system.
Federal Judge T.S. Ellis III told the parties in a hearing that he recognized the equities and good reasons on both sides of this motion and would agree to Manafort's lawyers' request for more time.
Mark Myers, a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, is among only a few people who have seen the well results outside of the oil companies that paid for it.
BOB EDWARDS, BYLINE: And this is NPR's MORNING EDITION.
In California, squid is an economic driver of the seafood industry – it's the fifth-largest fishery in the United States by weight. Yet most of this squid is frozen and exported overseas to China to be processed and distributed to over 42 countries across the globe. It's an export market that, according to 2011 figures, is valued at $107 million. Only 1.4 percent of it, on average, makes it back to the U.S. In 2015, that figure was 0.46 percent.
What triggers the ability to pass a bill in the Senate without threat of filibuster is a formal budget resolution. Republicans have still not passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1. The upcoming resolution is expected to call for a major tax cut bill. Some Republicans, notably Graham himself, have suggested adding health language to that resolution, which would be allowed.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., introduced legislation on Thursday to address the economic impact of the coronavirus. This is the third legislative package to deal with the outbreak.
In a letter to his grandchildren that he posted on his company Web site shortly after the election of Barack Obama in November, Kemp talked about how, as a quarterback for the old San Diego Chargers, playing for the AFL championship in Houston, his father sat on the 50-yard line, while his co-captain's father, who was black, had to sit in a small roped-off section of the end zone.
Some communities are doing their part in recruiting efforts by helping job seekers apply for census jobs. For now, many of the openings are for outreach specialists who work with local community groups, as well as for positions based in local and regional census offices.
And what the United States is playing for is that when it comes time for corporate tax reform, there will be a one-time tax charge on all of those offshore earnings as part of the transition to the new system. Let's call it 10 percent. Well, 10 percent of $2 trillion is $200 billion of free tax revenue.
Democrats across the state are also aiming to capitalize on an 84 percent increase in Democratic voter turnout during the Texas primaries earlier this year, according to The Cook Political Report.
The Trump factor is a complicated one here, too, as Roy has campaigned carefully so that he is not tied too closely to Trump.
This is obviously a pretty radical expansion of the regulation of political speech, said David Keating, president of the conservative Institute for Free Speech. If this bill had become law now, he said, anti-Trump groups would find it very difficult to speak as effectively as they have over the past two years.
This is in addition to the cancellation of numerous scheduled NRA programs and the competitions, an NRA spokesman said on Tuesday.
While some workers have moved across the country, others have relocated within the very-long-commute range.

While that the weapon — a shotgun — was not used in the shooting, the CEO said the revelation deeply affected Stack and his colleagues at Dick's.
BALDWIN: (Donald Trump) We're going to have so much coal, you're going to say, where did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal.
This law is not the end of our efforts, though, Biden said. I view it as only the beginning.
The document must be signed by the official. As with tax returns and other federal documents, false statements run the risk of penalties. There was no previous oversight of compliance.
MARTIN: We've got NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. So Scott, just start with what was supposed to happen. What was the intention of the Fed in making this rate cut?
Instead Trump has opted for rallies, press releases, photo ops, a handful of interviews and tweeting. Lots of tweeting.
BALDWIN: I'm a pitch man. I'm a pitch man. Anyway, thank you so much.
ELVING: They surprised and overwhelmed the opposing troops, many of whom were still recovering from the indulgences of Christmas Day. It is said that Washington got his troops pumped up for this midnight outing with readings of a new pamphlet by Thomas Paine, called, The American Crisis.
BARACK OBAMA: I returned to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future, and that is the issue of health care. I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.
DANIELS: (As General Washington) I propose that on the eve of December 25th, we cross the river, march on Trenton.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., are the only Democrats who have publicly opposed the idea, but many others have been selectively silent on the issue.
These approaches to problem-solving oversimplify the core underlying issues driving the need for state government intervention and they ignore the significant investments that are already being made by taxpayers.
MARTIN: And obviously paying attention because if it works, I assume it's going to have effects, implications for other diseases, right?
And all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal. It's that for such an important public policy, we should know more about it. The government should be more accountable. These cases should be better scrutinized.
GROSS: ...'Cause he's a fan of your work. Yeah.
Further efficiency, she says, could be achieved if consumers would be keen to fork over $1.50 a pound more for California-caught and processed squid.
The Census Bureau Needs To Hire Half A Million Workers For The 2020 Count
RAINBOW: In Roy Moore's memoir, I Like Big Butts, he recounts, romantically, the first time he laid eyes on his wife Kayla, writing, quote, I attended a dance recital and remember one of the special dances performed by a young woman whose first and last names began with the letter K. I always remembered her initials, K.K., because they were just one K short of being awesome. I'm paraphrasing that last part.
Trump, Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, the CFO of Trump's company, worked out the arrangement under which Cohen would be repaid the $130,000 he gave Daniels to keep her from talking, Cohen said.

Can a president really be this far removed from the reality base that the rest of official Washington takes for granted? Yes, say Rucker and Leonnig — and what is more, his free-form defiance of norms and restraints is the essence of Trump's governance — and of his enduring appeal to his adherents.
Jumping off of a ledge without a parachute
RAINBOW: Memos about Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, three high-profile defendants, are scheduled to be filed by special counsel Robert Mueller.
Ed Mahon/PA Post Bio Recent Stories Ed Mahon was a reporter for PA Post.
Those cuts are even more significant this year because for the first time since the law's implementation, open enrollment starts in November, rather than December, and lasts only 45 days.
NATAPOFF: And misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. They fund courts. They fund probation offices. They fund public defender offices. They fund prosecutor offices. Some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. It's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. It's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.
BALDWIN: And I moved there, and I said to myself, I'll do this for a year - one year only. I'll study. And if I get any kind of encouragement that I might have a career in this, I'll do it. And if I don't, I'm out. I'll go back to - I'll finish my poly-sci program and go to law school, and that's that. And I did the program for a year and got out. And I got a job right away, and I never stopped working since then.
With that in mind, tax analysts say the possibility of more revenue from pot shouldn't be the sole reason to support marijuana legalization because it may not be enough to solve big budgetary problems that states face.
Kasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors.
The Supreme Court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. So if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.
Many jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.
SULLIVAN: Fifteen months later, the then-governor announced the island couldn't pay any of its debt. It was broke. The bond funds crashed, savings, retirements, pensions gone. The government started closing hospitals. There was no money to shore up bridges or electrical grids. And then - well, you know what happened next. A Category 4 hurricane came barreling into Puerto Rico. If ever this island needed the federal government to come and bring its A-game, now was the time. What it got was anything but. Laura Sullivan, NPR News.
And she had many echoes of Trump in her speech — she said in her speech that she would impose targeted tariffs on companies that break the rules. Like Trump, she also pointed to currency manipulation and intellectual property theft as a problem.
BRESLOW: (Reading) Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
In the state House, Democratic Leader Frank Dermody said that members were preparing a discharge resolution to move the Restore PA bill out of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee if there is not quick enough action on it. It takes a majority vote in the House to pass a discharge resolution, sending it to the full House.
Maybe I'm not explaining it as well as I should, but those areas above Route 80 are actually places that could use this the most, where broadband doesn't exist, Wolf said on WITF's Smart Talk.
NATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.
The documents show Biden has earned far more than the rest of the 2020 presidential field, with the likely exception of billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race Tuesday.
2. The Trump administration has cut funding for efforts to sign people up for insurance.
ELVING: A few years later, conflicts between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives led to the so-called fiscal cliff. It was 2012. Obama had just been re-elected, and failure to strike a deal was about to cost taxpayers billions in spending cuts and tax increases. John Boehner, who was at the time the speaker of the House, exchanged offers and counteroffers with the White House.
LIASSON: Well, he's reassessing his campaign. But even if he doesn't continue as a candidate, he is still on track to play what could be a game-changing and historic role in the election because he has said he will spend whatever it takes - billions of dollars if necessary - to support whoever is the nominee of the party. And he'll fund down-ballot Democratic candidates. He'll fund get-out-the-vote drives. He'll fund everything. That's what he says he'll do. And that is pretty significant.
And the state is smack dab in the middle of the richest market in the world for the products that come out of this, Wolf said.

Take Edgewater, Colorado, a small town of 5,300 people in the Denver metro area. The city has five retail marijuana shops and they're projected to bring in more than $1 million in marijuana tax revenue this fiscal year.

Barrientos and others are now saying the focus of diabetes prevention in Mexico needs to shift away from shaming individuals to looking at new government policies to tackle this mounting health crisis.
GROSS: So we'll get back to theater camp.
But that pales in comparison with the mass murder of Muslims — massacres in Iraq; 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets executed or missing from Camp Speicher, a former American military base near Tikrit; the slaughter of hundreds of the al-Sheitat tribe in Syria; and the massacre of Syrian army POWs at Tabqa in 2014.
GROSS: Have you heard from Roy Moore?
RAINBOW: I did have a thing for mazes. When I was a kid, I remember drawing little mazes constantly and puzzles. I loved that. And I remember - to sort of tie it together, I - when I started listening to Sondheim's music, I always envisioned - I always pictured a puzzle 'cause that's sort of how his lyric writing is. It's, you know, very carefully and masterfully putting a puzzle together. And so when I got to know him and was invited to his home, and I saw that he's a collector of puzzles, it was quite a full circle moment.
Clinton, meanwhile, seems to be saying that looking to manufacturing's past is the wrong strategy; she emphasized this with an anecdote about how Futuramic (the company where she spoke) moved from auto supply to aerospace manufacturing to remain profitable.
The partial government shutdown, however, did give Hudson pause about working for the Census Bureau. She noticed the bureau was not updating portions of its website during the shutdown because of a lapse in federal funding, according to a banner splashed across the site.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Selling more of our goods and services around the world is a great way to create American jobs, help small businesses, and keep the United States ahead of its global competitors.
LIASSON: President Trump has laid out four pillars of the deal that he wants after he lifted the protection from deportation for these young people called DREAMers or DACA recipients. They were protected from deportation by President Obama. Trump lifted that protection. He gave Congress a deadline of March 5 before he says he'll start deporting those kids. What Trump wants is a path to citizenship for these kids. In exchange, he wants an end to the diversity lottery, an end to family reunification migration - he calls it chain migration. And, of course, he wants funding for the wall.
She knows a lot of her colleagues want to be back in the office at least part time. But for her, the goal is to be fully remote forever.

Leaked internal documents published last year detailing lavish six-figure spending on clothing and travel expenses for LaPierre prompted calls for his resignation from some of the group's now-former board members. Nonetheless, LaPierre remained the group's leader.
But Schumer says Democrats have a number of additional requests, including a vast expansion of unemployment insurance benefits.
So Gail Atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. And for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.
GROSS: Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow, and he does really funny song parodies about, typically, President Trump or, sometimes, Mike Pence. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
GROSS: Did you have a Cagney impression?
The moment punctuated remarks that focused predominantly on trade and training the countries' workers for manufacturing in the 21st century. In his statement at the start, Trump praised Germany's apprenticeship program that trains people to join the industrial workforce.
Our criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. We need it to go after dangerous people. We need it for deterrence and for public safety. And yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. Whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.
But are there unintended consequences? For instance, do subsidies encourage the production — and perhaps overconsumption — of things that we're told to eat less of? Think high fructose corn syrup or perhaps meat produced from livestock raised on subsidized grains.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: How much, if anything, will America get to see?
Gov. Tom Wolf proposed money for additional staffing at the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and he renewed his support for a package of pipeline reforms, in his annual budget released Tuesday.
For employers, moves bring costs and benefits
Democrats want to provide a major increase in the amount of money provided through the federal unemployment assistance program — perhaps as high as an equal match to the salary lost. Schumer is also calling for that program to be extended for many months, along with expansions to paid sick and family leave. The president signed a package Wednesday night that included a first round of paid sick and family leave as well as help for jobless Americans, but lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that a broader effort is needed as the economic impact continues to worsen.

First and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.
At MGM Grand Las Vegas, a bookmaker takes bets on sports events at the round counter at the Race & Sports Book near the casino. Hockey is among the games being broadcast on 47 flat screens above while gamblers sit in leather seats to watch and strategize.
Hundreds were detained at airports around the country Saturday in a chaotic and confusing day following President Trump's Friday night executive order temporarily banning Muslims from seven countries.
The basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.
The Post quoted copies of the foundation's 2015 IRS tax returns, which had been uploaded, apparently by the foundation's attorneys, to a nonprofit tracking site called GuideStar. The newspaper said it hadn't yet confirmed whether the forms had actually been sent to the IRS.
BROWN: There's a very simple - I wanted to invoke a Latin phrase here - nemo dat non habet. It means, no man gives what he does not have. The state cannot give what it does not have.
When you start really looking at what these jobs are, Americans kind of like what most federal employees do, Light says.

Republicans officially pulled the plug on their last-ditch effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday.
He said floods in 2018 were evidence that climate change had already come to Pennsylvania. Scientists say global warming will make the state's weather wetter, since warm air holds more moisture.
Amidst all the political turmoil, including top White House staffers resigning after reports of domestic abuse, tomorrow, the president will release his budget. Now, normally a presidential budget would be big news, but this time, it's a bit anticlimactic. Why? NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is about to tell us. Good morning, Mara.
Nonetheless, with Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in general treating the report as an exoneration, the authors tell us, Trump felt liberated. As one former official of his administration tells them: There's a new ethos: This is a presidency of one. It's Trump unleashed, unchanged, unhinged.
GROSS: Yeah. And you know, he's almost having, like, a little nervous breakdown...
Another voter walking the trail, Laura Hubbard, also plans to vote all blue, because she said Democrats align with her values, namely, having people that we can trust and what they say is believable. Honesty, transparency, giving all people a voice.
Cruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.
A big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. — Hillary Clinton

Perhaps this is why the government has begun funding programs, such as a subsidy for food stamp recipients to buy fresh food at farmers markets. Meanwhile, some insurers are experimenting with nudging shoppers to make better choices by offering rebates for healthful food.
Alexander similarly released a statement that he would consult with Murray and others on a limited bipartisan plan that could be enacted into law to help lower premiums and make insurance available to the 18 million Americans in the individual market in 2018 and 2019.
Ensure a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms
The kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also present, though he was one of the strongest backers of a provision in an earlier version of the legislation that would have increased the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The proposed wage increase was ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian last month.

One of those improvements is road paving. Teegardin even jokes that maybe they should be paving the road in green to show people how their marijuana tax dollars are being spent. They're also putting money toward a brand new civic center and a police station. Other cities in Colorado are funding homelessness programs and mental health centers. But Teegardin is not banking on this money coming in forever.
CAPACETE: One day this client tells me, are you aware of what they're doing in this other branch? And I said, tell me. And he told me the scheme.
That Trump paid Cohen, while in office, to cover the costs associated with buying the silence of a woman who said she had had a sexual relationship with Trump years earlier. Trump has acknowledged the payment but denied the underlying allegations about a sexual relationship.

We voted for this on Nov. 6. We were very clear about what we wanted, says Andrew Roberts, a spokesman for Utah Decides, the group that organized the Medicaid expansion referendum, known as Proposition 3.
One result of those cuts has been a 25 percent drop in DEP staff between 2003 and 2018.
Although policy directives announced this week were telegraphed last month, they come at a time when bitcoin has been trending about 50 percent lower than its peak of nearly $20,000 in mid-December. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, have also fallen sharply in the past week.
Cohen also suggested that Donald Trump Jr. may have told his father about the June 2016 meeting he scheduled at Trump Tower following an offer of help from the Russian government — one the president has denied he knew about at the time.
That's because both candidates are trying to latch onto — and insist that they can alleviate — a pervasive feeling among Americans that they just can't get ahead, and that it's related to a fast-changing U.S. economy. The candidates, of course, diverge vastly on many issues, but they also have some surprising areas of agreement.
Greisa Martinez of United We Dream said that part of the work that her organization and others are doing is engaging on policy with administration officials, but also being clear about what's at stake for folks outside of the administration.
DEP's Bureau of Air Quality would also get a boost under Wolf's proposed plan, which asks for an additional $1.5 million for new staff. And DCNR would get an additional $2.5 million for new state park and forest rangers. A recent report revealed DCNR has a backlog of maintenance projects underfunded by $1 billion. In total, the new budget would provide 25 new staff members at DEP and 25 at DCNR.

And dig deep into the 2014 bond documents, and you'll see it, too. Almost a quarter of the entire bond goes to pay them back, almost $900 million that didn't go to Puerto Ricans or even to keep the government afloat but went to pay back loans, pay fees or eliminate other risk of banks directly involved in putting the deal together. Barclays, which led the bond deal, got almost half a billion dollars; Banco Santander, 100 million; JPMorgan, 74 million; Morgan Stanley, 24 million; and others.

But in that energy efficient future, in that future that has a lower carbon footprint, we're going to need to have lightweight products and those lightweight products are going to be made of the natural resource that happens to lie beneath Pennsylvania, he said.
In this presidential election cycle, many Americans are casting votes based on their feelings about past trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and proposed deals, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
During the campaign, candidate Biden pulled out all the stops to make sure that young people knew the issues that mattered to them were deeply felt, in an effort to ensure that they would show up at the ballot box. Now, the Biden White House is acutely focused on making sure that those same young people feel heard.
Dana Bash, CNN: According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. Marco Rubio: Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money. Ted Cruz: Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.
RAINBOW: Well, that was one, I think - I think I have - I have a running list that I sort of refer to, and that was a song that I wanted to do for a while. So I had just been waiting for the right opportunity to do it and - you know, just a classic love song. So I figured it was right for him and Kim.

JENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.
The authors then have Trump saying: Hey John, what's this all about? What's this a tour of?
And like all the stories in the collection, it's full of Gurganus' deep-seated compassion and fascination with — and love for — humanity. This is a remarkable book, and it proves once again why Gurganus is one of the country's most talented and imaginative writers. Coming after a year where nothing went right, and the world was forced to realize that things might not work out in the end, it's a hopeful tonic. As Gurganus writes, We grant ourselves so little daily hope. Meanwhile, barely noticing, we've already managed wonders.
Though the industry employs a relatively small share of Americans, the emphasis on manufacturing — a strong sector that nevertheless has lost millions of jobs — may nevertheless resonate with the many Americans who hear that the economy is recovering, yet feel that they no longer have the opportunities for prosperity that they once had.
NATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.
A 2012 survey of top economists showed 85 percent say the benefits of free trade are much larger than any effects on employment. Only 5 percent were uncertain. But critics point to data showing trade puts downward pressure on low-skilled factory wages and jobs. They also say the deals have done far too little to protect workers' rights and the environment.
When Trump sent those tweets, the Post immediately rejected criticism. It stood behind its reporters just as it did in the Watergate era, when the team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein sparked the larger, official investigations that would drive President Richard Nixon from office. Their work relied substantially on unnamed sources, including one in particular (Deep Throat) who turned out to be the deputy director of the FBI.

The early days of the Biden administration have been focused on meeting the immediate needs of the nation as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, including a $1.9 trillion emergency relief plan currently before Congress.
Whatever may happen to that impeachment effort in the weeks and months ahead, it creates a moment of intermission in the Trump saga and a chance to consider how the landscape has already been altered by this president. A Very Stable Genius offers a harrowing companion narrative to be read during intermission.
Do voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school? asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.
Cointelegraph.com writes: Bithumb, which is the largest exchange globally at $2.85 [billion] daily trading volume as of press time, was hacked in February 2017, losing about $7 [million] in mostly Bitcoin and Ether. This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers.
In a statement, Sanders said that in the coming days he will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.
Cohen even reportedly lied about delivering his own son in the hospital, Jordan said.
GROSS: So you do your videos in your home alone. You direct yourself. How many - I love your reaction shots because you have this, like, incredibly expressive face and really big eyes. And your reaction shots to what, you know, Trump is saying are always, like, hilarious. How do you direct yourself, and how many takes do you do?
Schumer acknowledged in an interview on NPR's Morning Edition that there is public pressure for lawmakers to set aside differences and pass a bill quickly.
With their moves, Dick's and Walmart join a host of major companies that made changes in reaction to the Parkland shooting. As NPR's Amy Held reported last week, many other high-profile companies — from MetLife Insurance and First National Bank of Omaha to Symantec and Hertz — have ended their corporate partnerships with the National Rifle Association.

But football was good preparation in other ways, because Kemp clearly saw — in a way many of his white peers somehow did not — how ridiculous and destructive racism was for people who were trying to reach a common goal.
It could be as low as 9.1 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas extracted and as high as 15.7 cents per thousand cubic feet.
Citing Merkel's interview with another German paper, Saarbruecker Zeitung, the BBC says the chancellor planned to remind Trump that BMW's plant in South Carolina exported more cars than GM and Ford together from America.
RAINBOW: Well, this for me was the perfect song to kind of pinpoint the emotions that everyone was feeling that week because the Mueller report had come out, but it hadn't really. And people were happy, and they were not. And they were frustrated. It was just - everyone was sort of running this gamut of emotions. And so my mind immediately went to this song, which kind of encapsulates that feeling of being all over the place.
But there are some big potential upsides for employers to remote work. Companies can hire talent in places they couldn't before, Sethi says.

It has to do with the American desire for a larger squid, explains Diane Pleschner-Steele, executive director of the California Wetfish Producers Association. A lot of squid that is shipped overseas stays overseas because they prefer it. They eat it over there. Our consumers typically prefer a larger squid, and so there's just a ton of squid imported into this country that comes in at a far lower price.

The best-case scenario seems to be a slight positive effect, but most people would interpret it as no effect, he says.
GROSS: Good. Please do not deny us these...
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Oh, OK. But when the budget comes out tomorrow, the spotlight will probably turn to White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, right? He was famously hawkish on the deficit when he was in Congress. What will he have to say?
Making those changes would require the state of Utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.
HORSLEY: There is. For example, South Korea is asking for just money to help businesses that are adversely affected by the epidemic. President Trump has been talking about a payroll tax holiday, which was something that was done during the recession. But there's been little follow-up on that from the White House and almost no talk about it on Capitol Hill.
GROSS: And are you going to be sued by any of the estates (laughter)...

As far as Europe goes, there is an ocean between the U.S. and Europe, and the U.S. already has very strict procedures in place for refugees, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported.

The statement asserted the company's support for the Second Amendment but continued, we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic.
NATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.
His efforts to get the soda tax increased even more, however, have so far been unsuccessful.
TRUMP: We didn't sign anything today. It didn't quite work out.
On the day he announced his choice for secretary of state, Trump tweeted praise for his pick, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, but didn't appear with him publicly. Trump did go down to the lobby of Trump Tower so he could be photographed with rapper Kanye West.
The bill would declare an intent to revive core anti-discrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were effectively shut down by the Supreme Court six years ago. It would also state that failing to vote isn't grounds for taking away a person's voter registration.
We know that it interferes with employment. It can mean that they lose welfare benefits, become ineligible for financial aid for education. They can lose their housing. It can threaten their immigration status. It can disqualify them for all kinds of jobs and licenses.
There might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.
ELVING: Things were not going well for General Washington and his ragtag colonial army.
He wasn't expecting so many newsmen to show up. But since then, it has become a tradition, a fixture of the relationship between the president, the press and, by extension, the American public.
Additionally, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $750 billion to raise funding for unemployment insurance, coronavirus treatment and emergency child care assistance. This spending measure is separate from the aid the White House is seeking from Congress.
People think that adult dependents aren't having to pay their rent, aren't contributing to their own household income and well-being, said Sarah Audelo, the executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action. So there are some pieces that are very distinct to, 'Wow, this is an experience that someone who's 20 years old will only have.' So we need people who have that experience to be able to bring that perspective forward.
BALDWIN: And I thought, God, what a horrible thing to say. (Imitating James Cagney) You want air? I'll give you air. And we used to do that. I'd lay in bed next to my mother. My mother was trying to sleep. She would take naps every day. This was when I was like 10, and my mother had six little kids. You realize - I look now at my children, my young children, and I realized my mother had little children. So they need to be constantly watched.
What's more, if the implication is that the U.S. is not admitting Christian refugees or that the U.S. is making it difficult, that's not true at all. In fact, the number of Christian refugees to the U.S. in 2016 was almost equal to that of Muslim refugees — 37,521 to 38,901, according to the Pew Research Center, which is basing its numbers on figures from the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services.
But the truth is that Americans aren't willing to pay for it, she says. If people were willing to pay the price, we can definitely feed the demand.

Door-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion.

It's hard to protect our environment if we don't have the environmental cops on the beat to enforce the laws and implement programs, Masur said. But it would be valuable if we had a long-term plan in order to make DEP and DCNR whole.
Company leaders are a bit less enthusiastic. A parallel survey of executives found that 68% believe workers should be in the office at least three days a week to maintain company culture, and 65% believe the office is very important to increasing employee productivity.
RAINBOW: Do I know her better? No, I don't. But I did do - before Trump came along and I was doing those more nonpolitical videos, I did a series of videos where I would lip sync to Patti Lupone's autobiography...

Smith has been a conservative Republican, voting for President Trump's tax plan and taking a hard line on immigration. Smith is also a climate-change skeptic, who serves as chair of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which oversees the Environmental Protection Agency.
GROSS: So let's talk a little bit about your memoir Nevertheless. One of the things I really enjoyed learning about you is that growing up in Long Island - Massapequa, Long Island, you watched a lot of old movies on TV. I grew up in New York City in Brooklyn and watched a lot of the same movie shows that you did - The Late Show, The Late Late Show, The Early Show. What was the Sunday afternoon thing you mentioned?
It would remain. Wolf says that impact fee is important for areas directly affected by drilling.
We've seen around the country examples of judges who actually punish public defenders when they try to litigate issues on behalf of their clients when they want to go to trial, when they want to file a motion. Judges have been known to hold public defenders in contempt or threaten to hold them in contempt because they're holding up the docket.
Why would Assad do that? His regime loves to paint itself as a protector of minorities, and there are still a large number of Christians in the Syrian capital of Damascus, for example, where Assad's government is centered.

RAINBOW: I think other people probably thought that about me, but I have some kind of weird inner quality that - it's just a confidence that I have. I'm very - I'm not very sure of anything in my life, but there's always been something in me that has known that I'm going to get where I'm going, one way or the other. So it really was never a concern to me. I always knew if I just stuck to my guns and did what I wanted to do and put out work that I thought was good and funny and entertaining, it would work out.
In one case, the Post said Trump settled a dispute with Florida's Palm Beach County over the size of a flagpole at his Mar-a-Lago club by agreeing to make a donation to a veterans' charity. Trump made the donation using funds from the foundation, the newspaper reported.
To the authors' credit, the on-the-record elements are compelling on their own. These include attributed material from former strategist Steve Bannon, former transition chief (and former New Jersey governor) Chris Christie and some of Trump's Manhattan peers, Tom Barrack Jr. and Chris Ruddy.

MARTIN: OK. The World Health Organization says that the death rate of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus - that death rate is now at about 3.4%, which is higher than previously thought. The battle against coronavirus is really happening on a lot of different fronts, including at the Federal Reserve.
GROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing. So what are the consequences of that?

RAINBOW: Yeah, absolutely. I have, and I've pushed myself to do so because I always considered song parody kind of cheap. And I've always been - part of me - a little embarrassed that I do it and that I'm, you know, kind of ripping off other people's work. But it's only now that I'm - that I've been doing it - and then I've gotten response from others, including the actual artists who originated the work, that I'm appreciating it as an art form. But I think that I've pushed myself because I think that if I'm not going to write the original music to go with the lyrics, I'd better step it up and bring something special and strong to the table.
ELVING: The House got caught up wrangling over a foreign aid bill that included selling wheat to Russia, which in those days was still the Soviet Union.
1. Insurers still face tremendous uncertainty.
Many young activists pointed to that package as a meaningful example of why it's so important that they be involved in policy conversations. The package now includes adult dependents among those eligible for stimulus payments.
Light says Trump's rhetoric about a hiring freeze and promises to drain the swamp seem to address concerns about thinning the ranks of government and making it more effective. But, in fact, hiring freezes tend not to do that, because while dislike of government is popular, he says, nearly all government programs are popular, too, from National Parks to food inspection to Medicare.

There will be fewer people through the doors. But there will be plenty of opportunities a lot of other places for people like us to, in a sense, run their book for them, only because of what we have done, only because the way that we do business, only because of what we do and how we handle it, he says. We will get opportunities. I think the opportunity will outweigh drastically the little part that we lose people coming to the South Point.
It's an astounding story (although one that will likely send any dog lovers reading it into a panic attack); Gurganus proves to be a master of pacing, recounting the dog's struggle in exacting, finely observed detail. Remarkably, he tells the story with no dialogue; the narrator only sees the couple communicating in gestures — it's a technique that somehow manages to amp up the tension of the story while still making clear the love the couple have for each other and for their beloved pet.
The next day, Bush introduced his choice for secretary of state and took more questions. The day after that, he answered yet more questions during a press conference to introduce his national security adviser and White House counselors.
Restore PA is structured around a severance tax that lasts for another 20 years, said Karen Feridun of the Better Path Coalition. It's bad enough that we would be committed to 20 more years of fracking, (and) it includes incentives for the petrochemical business.

BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's interview with actor Alec Baldwin. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. Terry spoke to him in 2017 when his memoir called Nevertheless was published.
But he was - it was tough. You know, he would come home and six kids and my mom - and I think everybody was just stressed out. And he'd be reading the capsule reviews in The Times' TV section. And my dad would say, wow, How Green Was My Valley. That's a good one. At 11:30, I'd say, can we watch How Green Was My Valley, Dad? I was 10 years old. He'd say, no, no, no. It's too late. He goes, well, let's just watch 10 minutes - 10 minutes, 15 minutes of How Green Was My Valley and you have to go to bed. I'd be like, sure, Dad, sure. It would work like a charm. TV comes on, How Green Was My Valley, my dad passes out on the couch. He falls asleep, and I watch all of How Green Was My Valley. I watched the whole thing. Some nights I actually got away with watching a piece of the next one that was on at, like, 1:15 in the morning.
The Bidens gave $275,896 to charity last year. The rate – about six percent of their overall income – was higher than any other candidate except Warren, who also donated about the same percentage of her income.

ELVING: He certainly has gotten an upgrade in terms of his independence and his integrity. That would be in recognition of his handling of the situation on Wednesday night when he was counting the Electoral College votes, weathering the wrath of the protesters and the president. But where is he now? Is he with Trump or is he not? That will be answered in the week ahead, and that will have a profound effect on what the Congress does and what happens to Donald Trump in the future.

Republicans and the White House rejected Cohen's allegations before he even made them, pointing out that he has pleaded guilty to federal charges of lying to Congress and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
GROSS: Sensibility-wise, you are, like, the opposite of Donald Trump. But in spite of being so different from Trump, you've said that Trump reminds you of your father.
GROSS: No, no that is great. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he does really funny song parodies about President Trump. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
MARTIN: All right. Let's finish on Mike Bloomberg because this is the first time he actually appeared on any ballot. He has spent an enormous amount of money. He only took American Samoa, a territory, last night. So what happens to his campaign moving forward?
BALDWIN: Lugosi, all those movies. Well, Lugosi...
We're not going to get into how people voted ... of course people can be fair no matter who they voted for, Ellis said.
RAINBOW: He was - you know, for as negative a force he was in my life, he was also - he was not the worst. He was very tolerant and did not mind at all that I was gay. He also claims to have had no idea growing up, so that shows you sort of how, you know, trapped in his own brain he was. He had - you know, it was a total shock to him when I came out, which was kind of absurd.
We'll see what happens after that

In late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.
Many organizers also say they're keenly aware that the administration is currently having its honeymoon period.
Another area in which Clinton and Trump broadly agree: both want to ramp up infrastructure spending.
I like how he's reaching out to all the different leaders, Poulus said. I love the trade wars. I think that's gonna be OK. I think it's shaking things up a bit, shaking up the status quo, and then actually it will probably come back to be very good in the end.
Pelosi also told Democrats that the legislation would approve paid emergency leave; enhanced unemployment insurance; more food aid; and increased federal funds for health care.
As for who will bid in the lease sale, that's another mystery.
Tayesha Hudson is interested in helping with door-knocking and collecting census information in the Bronx. If she is hired for the job, though, she expects to do a lot of persuading of community members who, she says, may not see the point of participating in the census.
Census job postings have noted that U.S. citizenship is a requirement, as it is for most federal government positions. For past head counts, however, the Census Bureau has received exemptions to hire noncitizens with special language or cultural skills to serve as translators and in outreach positions.
ADLER: And in his 2017 State of the State...
Public Citizen: Regarding TPP, This massive, controversial, pro-corporate 'free trade' agreement ... threatens everything from the safety of our food to the stability of our economy.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House agreed Friday on relief legislation in response to the national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)
What we know from the polls — as much as we can trust them nowadays — is that you have 80 to 90 percent of Germans saying they pretty much abhor what [Trump is] doing, Koch tells NPR.
In light of the guidance issued by the CDC, we will be adjusting the House schedule. It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis, Hoyer said in a letter to House Democrats.
Why the Republican House Speaker doesn't like Restore PA
GROSS: ...Then you fall in love with afterwards. So...
Reuters reports: The new requirements are meant to ensure that a cryptocurrency investor's money comes from a bank account owned by the same individual. Banks will be able to refuse to open accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges that do not disclose information about suspicious trading. They were told to closely monitor crypto trading that exceeds 10 million won ($9,338) a day or 20 million won ($18,676) per week and also accounts owned by corporations or groups and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
RAINBOW: And that was actually a - fairly a - at least among the gay and Broadway communities was kind of a fairly successful series for me. And I understand that she was a fan of that. I hope so.
Wolf has also received endorsements from community leaders across the state — although, he acknowledged, relatively few north of Interstate 80.

If any leases are bought and finalized, it will be just the start of a long process. Industry analysts say it would take at least a decade to actually pump oil out of Alaska's Arctic refuge.
RAINBOW: Well, just behaviorally and - so much so that my father, who's no longer with us - he actually died shortly after Trump's election - but his campaign was going on, you know, at the end of his life. And even he said that he couldn't watch Trump on TV because it reminded him so much of himself. So these conversations that the world is now having about Trump's behavior are conversations that were had within my family about my dad constantly. So I think that's kind of why I really have his number.
2. What would it take to fix it?
However, it's important to point out that the manufacturing industry itself is doing pretty well, something that isn't readily apparent from Trump's rhetoric. In fact, manufacturing output is about where it was at its pre-recession peak.
Wolf opposes the measure from Bartolotta and Republican Pat Stefano. In 2014, then-Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, advanced a similar idea, which his administration called non-impact drilling. It was controversial and ultimately did not result in any new leasing or revenue to the state.
KLEINBARD: No (laughter). You know, Apple is a really interesting example of this. Today in its press conferences and two years ago in Tim Cook's testimony before the Senate - tried to make the point that the real brains of the operation of Apple, the real drivers of its profitability are its software engineers in Cupertino. Well, if that were true...
LIASSON: That's what we learned last night.
MARXUACH: That's what they get their fees for essentially. And then they're off. They are not on the hook.
GROSS: Yeah, what really scared you when you were young? Yeah.
It's not clear how much these programs would cost, but they could get expensive. Trump's would cut the tax liabilities of richer families in particular. Clinton's, meanwhile, would expand the Child Tax Credit and further subsidize child care, as the Washington Post has reported. The Huffington Post pointed to Sanders' universal child care plan — which, admittedly, is not quite the same as Clinton's — to provide a sense of scale. The bill for that plan came out at $35 billion per year, by one estimate.
Trump is quoted saying to Modi at one point: It's not as though you have China right on your border... We are told this prompted Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it. (For the record, India's 2,500-mile border with China is more than 500 miles longer than the U.S. border with Mexico.)
Since his second term began last year, there's been a theme for Tom Wolf's tenure as Pennsylvania's governor: climate change.
LONG: Governments don't collapse like that. And, yeah, there was hundreds of people looking at this, and nobody saw it. This is like - I mean, look at it from the outside. Yeah, this is a crazy story, man.
RAINBOW: (Singing) Now, look who's his favorite guy. I've got those, Nancy, go and get him. Never mind, girl, I'm exhausted blues, Mueller blues. Those, what the hell is Comey doing standing in a forest? - feelings. Host, bartender, we're going to need to refill my cup. And since there's no collusion, could you make something up? And why does Devin's cow have way more followers than I do? - feelings. Those, is it over? What just happened? Can't we just arrest Ivanka? Where's the rest? I got to see it. Give it to me. I don't want it. Yes. No. Black. White. Red. Blue. Left. Right. Thank you. Go away now. Please don't leave me, Robert Mueller, blues.
RAINBOW: I'm here now with the latest castoff from The Bachelor Hanoi, fresh off his second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
RAINBOW: No, I've never been good at auditions. That's why this whole Internet thing we've got going has been such a blessing for me. And the fact that I've been able to utilize it to get myself out there is really something I'm really grateful for because it's given me the opportunity to produce things, you know, for myself in the way that I want to present myself to the world and then put them out there. I don't know if I didn't have that ability that things would've taken off as they did.
Trump hinted that he would be prioritizing Christians before the order was released on Friday. Here's the transcript of Trump's exchange with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody:
Alejandro Calvillo, the head of a consumer group called El Poder del Consumidor, says soda is making Mexicans sick.
Of those 99 lawmakers, 83 are Democrats and 16 are Republicans.
And so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.
Wolf says how the money is used will depend on the needs of each community.
Trade Matters In 2016; This May Help You Understand Why
Pressed by reporters, Trump brushed off suggestions that he had changed his tone. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic, Trump said.
Martin Carnoy wrote for the left-leaning Economic Policy institute in February: Extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., objected to the proceedings on Wednesday before Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had even delivered his opening statement, leading to a dispute over whether the hearing could continue.
Richmond and Susan Rice, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, held a virtual meeting last week with more than a dozen youth activists focused on community violence prevention. The White House released an official readout of the meeting, saying that Rice and Richmond underscored President Biden's commitment to taking action to make our communities safer and to ensure that equity drives our policymaking across the federal government.
I heard this same response from other farm economists and academics who study agriculture policy. The authors of the new study suggest we should realign government support programs toward more healthful foods. I would agree with that, Harold Van Es, of Cornell University, told me. Although this does not necessarily imply that we should not support [i.e., insure] the traditional commodities.
SULLIVAN: These bonds were specifically designed to sell to Puerto Ricans. They were part of special bond funds that were far riskier than what regulators allow on the mainland. Brokers sold tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans into these special funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the island's wealth was now highly concentrated at the worst possible time. And then Capacete heard a troubling story.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a passionate proponent of expanding school choice, including private school vouchers and charter schools, and she has the clear backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her enthusiasm?
RAINBOW: (Singing) She was 16, going on 17; Roy Moore was 32. Flagrantly lusting - he's just disgusting, and frankly, so are you. She was 17, going on 18, when she went out with Moore. Think it's a smear? Look - he signed her yearbook when he was 34. Here comes Steve Bannon, Trump and Pence, McConnell, Mike and Ben, fashioning false equivalence, protecting gross old men.
TRUMP: He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.
We don't know very much about this area, says David Houseknecht, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Oil seeps and rock formations seem promising, but he says the agency hasn't estimated the coastal plain's oil potential since the late 1990s.
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized that the check was drawn on the trust that Trump created to give up control of his business after he was elected. That indicated that he stayed involved, despite his claims, and interacted with Trump Jr. and Weisselberg to make the payments to Cohen.
Yes, we've enjoyed a monopoly or a near monopoly on sports betting, but Las Vegas benefits when there there's interest in our field, in our field of entertainment sports, sports betting, gambling in general, said Jim Murren, the chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. It will promote activity, increase fan interest in the team, in the sport, in the league which we believe will in turn increase their interest in going to the sports mecca of sports betting and gambling: Las Vegas.
TOTENBERG: Inside the court chamber, the justices seemed to concede that the court's prior decisions were wrong. But a majority said Congress would be better equipped to deal with the problem. South Dakota's Jackley objected, noting that the states have been trying to get Congress to pass legislation for 26 years, and Congress has turned a blind eye.
But even as ISIS claims it fights for Sunni Islam, fellow Sunni Muslims have also been killed and displaced in greater numbers than Christians. That is in part because ISIS operates mostly in Sunni areas. Hundreds of thousands of Sunnis have been displaced from ISIS areas, as Sunnis, who try to oppose the group or have ties to the Iraqi government, are targeted.
Ethics Agency Rejects White House Move To Block Ethics Waiver Disclosures
The rate of the severance tax would vary based on the average annual price of natural gas.
CONWAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Excuse me.
It's also possible that farm subsidies have less influence on what we ultimately choose to eat than this study suggests. (More on that below.) So, this paper doesn't prove a cause and effect. However, this is certainly not the first time that U.S. farm policy has been implicated in the obesity epidemic.
JEROME POWELL: We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on Wall Street since the financial crisis. This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. They don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.
HORSLEY: Now, futures markets are pointing to the possibility of a rebound on Wall Street today, so there may be some reassessment. Although that may also reflect investors' attitudes about yesterday's Super Tuesday results.
Sturm is referring to the millions of people already betting online. The American Gaming Association estimates that people bet $150 billion on professional and college sports illegally every year.

We've created this handy widget to track how long it has been since Donald Trump held a formal press conference and how many times he has tweeted in that time. It will keep counting until he holds one.
There are so many people that it's hard to even walk at a fast clip.
Some of your very best employees who can get a job in the private sector will take it, Light says. And to backfill positions that need to be filled, agencies end up hiring more expensive contract workers, instead, which are generally not included in the freeze.
RAINBOW: Just that kind of phony, you know, bravado. And there's just, like, a - you know, I hate to put down any group of people, but there's just a generation of, like, New York guy that - he just came from that stock. And it was just - there was nothing genuine, nothing introspective. It was just textbook narcissism. And I think there are - there's a large group of men who are like that.
But that would complicate efforts for both bills.

BALDWIN: And you're such an animated person.
On Monday, the White House recommended new guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus over the next 15 days, urging older Americans to stay home. Trump asked all residents to avoid crowds of more than 10 people, avoid travel and stop eating in restaurants.
The admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. Some must have open enrollment. Others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.

The decision is a disappointment for progressives but relieves immediate pressure on Democratic Party leaders who are attempting to rally support for the overall bill despite concerns from at least two Democrats who say $15 is too high.
Part of the challenge of encouraging broader consumption of fruits and vegetables is the expense. The production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables is relatively high, independent of government support programs, Van Es says.
Two kinds of people went to work for the administration, we are told on the prologue's third page, those who thought Trump was saving the world and those who thought the world needed to be saved from Trump.
BROWN: Let me end in the immortal words of Woody Guthrie...
You should think of Medicaid expansion as no different than if you said, 'Oh, hey, somebody's going to go open up a factory, says Bryce Ward, an economist at the University of Montana, in Missoula. And that factory is going to bring, in the case of Montana, $600 million of outside money into the state that we're going to pay to workers here.

Myers, the former Alaska commissioner, agrees development costs could dampen interest.
SIMON: And in the meantime, which is an extraordinary way of beginning the sentence, this country is still in extraordinary crisis. The number of coronavirus deaths rises. The number of infections are on the rise. The economic crisis deepens. There's been an extraordinary Russian hacking of security services. We could go on. The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been slow and insufficient. Is President Trump paying attention?
A conservative Republican versus a moderate Democrat
GROSS: Was there this feeling in the house that unless your father was pleased that there would be, like, a dark cloud hanging over the family?
MARTIN: Right. So as you have pointed out, there are limits to what monetary policy can do when it comes to something like a public health crisis like the coronavirus. Is there another option for governments to employ?
SULLIVAN: Has anybody come forward from inside these banks to talk about what was really going on?
In all, 52 members signed the letter. Both Swalwell and Porter previously urged remote voting ahead of the health crisis, saying it should be an option to members regardless. However, the issue has taken on a new urgency with the coronavirus outbreak.
Murray said Tuesday she is ready to keep working on the bipartisan path that could lead to results.
BRODY: Persecuted Christians, we've talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you're looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.
The time has come for the people in the General Assembly to really have some serious conversations about this, Hess said. I see a lot of seeds in this budget that can grow into something that more completely meets our environmental funding obligations.

An earlier round of hiring beginning in 2016 for partnership specialists — charged with encouraging the hardest-to-count groups, including communities of color, to participate in the census — encountered smaller than expected applicant pools, declined offers, and turnover, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.
MARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.
But having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.
Trump stands accused in these pages of gross incompetence, rampant racism, pathological narcissism, indifference to facts and ethics, and a penchant for chaos. There can be no doubt the prosecutors are asking the jury — and the judgment of history — for a verdict of guilty.

There is not a ban on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June. In a new statement, the agency says it's still pursuing all legal flexibilities provided by Congress to hire the workforce we will need to conduct an accurate 2020 Census.
The pincer movement is forcing the essential incompatibility of these different stories to the fore. But this is not about real jobs. This is about shifting of profits through paper transactions.
For last year's test run of the 2020 census in Rhode Island's Providence County, the bureau sent out into the field about 70 percent of the workers it planned to bring on.

She previously worked on the presidential campaigns of Democrats Jay Inslee and Elizabeth Warren, before helping to launch the climate group Evergreen.
The revenue is basically a drop in the bucket for the state budget. But for local communities, which can levy their own taxes on the marijuana industry, it appears that marijuana tax money can actually make more of a difference.
GROSS: How did you decide to pursue acting in the first place? You were interested in politics. You ran for the president of George Washington University when you were a student there. You lost. And then it seems like a big switch from politics and history to acting.
Responsible natural gas development has been good for the state economy, good for local economies and good for Pennsylvanians, said API-PA director Stephanie Catarino Wissman. This initiative doesn't restore Pennsylvania; it jeopardizes Pennsylvania's economy and the hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by natural gas production.
Kemp's words to his grandchildren are instructive here, too. He said, My advice for you, too, is to understand that unity for our nation doesn't require uniformity or unanimity. It does require putting the good of our people ahead of what's good for mere political or personal advantage.
We have firefighters that were being furloughed, said Richmond. We have frontline workers that we truly care about and want to support that are struggling and without giving aid to state and local governments, those frontline workers in those states won't receive help.

JOHN BOEHNER: Now, even if we did exactly what the president wants, we would see red ink for as far as the eye can see. Now, if the president doesn't agree with our approach, he's got an obligation to put forward a plan that can pass both chambers of the Congress.
They are likely to have at least one more opportunity to talk with each other after this visit. Trump has accepted Merkel's invitation to the G-20 Summit, which will be held in Germany this summer.
Yesterday was a test of three things - money, momentum and movement or organization. It turns out money didn't mean so much. Bloomberg spent a ton of it and didn't do very well. In terms of movement and organization, well, Bernie Sanders had that in spades. Joe Biden only had one field office in California...
Kettl warns that just cutting federal agencies could backfire. When they need them, he says, Americans demand robust and functional government service. Think of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he says, or Sept. 11, 2001.
While the acknowledgment that the GOP lacks the votes to overhaul the health law means an immediate vote will not happen, the Republicans have potentially two more shots to try to pass a bill with a simple majority vote.
Hazardous site cleanup, severance tax and more park rangers
Trump's tax plan is where he hews much more closely to other Republicans' ideas. In fact, he recently overhauled his initial tax plan (which has been removed from his website) in favor of a new plan with brackets that match those proposed by House Republicans, though Trump has said would also add in a zero bracket. His new plan would lower the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and with that zero bracket would have only four brackets, down from the current seven.
But what does this mean for bookmakers like Jimmy Vaccaro, who has been doing this work for 41 years?
They agreed on a year's worth of periodic smaller payments that would make it look like Cohen was getting a retainer as Trump's lawyer, he said. Trump signed some of the checks, one of which Cohen gave to the committee. At least one was signed by Trump Jr. and Weisselberg, which Cohen also gave committee members.
Former federal public defender Alexandra Natapoff says 13 million misdemeanors are filed each year in the U.S., trapping the innocent, punishing the poor and making society more unequal.
The standout story in the collection is Fetch, in which a narrator tells the story of witnessing a middle-aged couple taking their Labrador retriever to the beach.

GROSS: In your memoir, you write that you learned lines from a lot of different films. So I'm going to ask you to do a passage from a film that you still remember.
However, the most recent Pew polling shows anti-trade sentiments have now surged among Republicans (with 40 percent calling free trade a good thing vs. 52 percent seeing it as a bad thing). Those who support candidate Donald Trump are especially anti-trade (67 percent said it was a bad thing vs. 27 percent a good thing). Even though Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said they oppose the TPP, most Democrats support trade (60 percent good thing vs. 30 percent bad thing).
California's not turning back - not now, not ever. His truth is marching on.
STEIN: Now, for the first time, they've tried this entirely new strategy to try to treat someone with a rare genetic disease that destroys their vision.
Trump and Clinton both champion manufacturing in their speeches — it goes hand in hand with their strong rhetoric on trade. Trump focuses on the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs — the U.S. now has around 12.3 million manufacturing jobs, down by more than 7 million from a late-1970s peak. And while automation has helped to eat away at manufacturing jobs, there's also good evidence that China — one of Trump's chief villains when he talks about trade — played a big role in hurting U.S. manufacturing jobs.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders slammed the House oversight committee for giving Cohen a venue to air public complaints against the president when Cohen is a convicted liar.

ELVING: Ah, yes, the reality check of it all. We do have 4,000 people dying in a single day now. Last month, the economy lost jobs for the first time in eight months. And as you say, the computer systems of our government and other major institutions are under cyberattack from Russia. There is a lot that a president might want to prioritize right now other than his own personal fate.

In their final pages, the authors draw a clear line from that moment to the one when Trump makes the moves regarding aid to Ukraine and his desired investigation of prospective rival Joe Biden — the line that led on to Trump's impeachment.
Knowledge Ecology International had been preparing to file a citizen petition to push the FDA to reverse its decision on remdesivir, Love says. Now, it won't have to.
ELVING: That question will probably dominate his thinking in his last days in office, Scott. Legal machinery is already working in New York state, possibly elsewhere, fashioning cases to hold him accountable, perhaps for tax deficiencies. There have been allegations of bank fraud, misrepresentations about his properties, among other possible charges. And state charges would be unaffected by his pardon power, which is strictly for federal crimes. And let's not forget that just last weekend, Trump got on a phone, was taped with the Georgia secretary of state pressuring that official to, quote, find, unquote, enough votes so that Trump could win. That may well be a prosecutable offense as well.
After Super Tuesday, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are the front-runners. U.S. financial markets fell again on concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. And, details of a new development in medicine.

Walmart, which ended sales of modern sporting rifles such as AR-15s in 2015, has announced that it is raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. The company notes that it does not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories.
The collection kicks off with The Wish for a Good Young Country Doctor, which made something of a splash when it was originally published in The New Yorker last spring. The story is narrated by an antique collector reflecting on his days as an American studies graduate student; he was part of a band of merry hippie researchers and cerebral hucksters who frequented antique stores in the Midwest, delighting in every kitschy old toy they managed to dig up.
The administration is also planning to allow Americans to defer tax payments up to $1 million for 90 days.
SHAPIRO: Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at USC, thanks very much.
MARTIN: (Laughter) Right. So we should just point out, we hear a lot about the fact that Bernie Sanders took California; Joe Biden came out on top of Texas - two very delegate-rich states. But it doesn't mean that each of those candidates walks away with all those delegates, right?
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Song parodies about President Trump and members of his administration - that's what my guest Randy Rainbow has become famous for. He borrows the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. He took the melody of the Mary Poppins song Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and turned it into a Trump song titled Super-Callous Fragile-Egocentric Braggadocious.
TRUMP: It's doing really well. I have great people.
NATAPOFF: So one of the great fallacies of the misdemeanor universe is that getting a misdemeanor is no big deal, that it's just a misdemeanor, that it won't dog you for your life. And that has come to be, you know, profoundly untrue. A misdemeanor conviction, although of course not as serious as a felony conviction, still imposes enormous burdens on the people who carry them.
MARXUACH: Fund managers, they will not admit this now, but when Puerto Rico was selling debt like pancakes, they loved Puerto Rico debt. Since they had slightly higher interest rates and no taxes attached to them, you immediately look like a genius, right? You just bump up the entire return for the entire portfolio. So that's your bonus, right? That's your new Mercedes, your new yacht.
Cohen said Trump told him to lie about the medical deferments Trump received that excused him from the draft during the Vietnam War. Cohen said Trump had no medical records to back up his claim of a medical deferment but said he wasn't stupid and had no intention of being drafted.
Clinton's framed her business taxes, meanwhile, as a way to stop companies from leaving the U.S. — she would imposes an exit tax on some companies leaving the country, and she also said she would crack down on tax inversions, in which a company moves its headquarters in order to take advantage of lower tax rates overseas.

Their new, collaborative account — titled A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America — walks readers step by step through the first 30 months or so of a presidency like no other. They leave little doubt that they and many of their sources regard that presidency as an unmitigated and deepening disaster — a threat to American government as we have known it.
The state has a slew of local and state taxes on retail marijuana. Almost everybody through the entire supply chain is paying into the system, including growers, testing laboratories and retail shops. To some extent, pot is paying for schools in Colorado, with much of the state tax revenue going toward school maintenance and construction - paying for things like new roofs and HVAC systems in rural school districts.
So their fees can include jail fees, supervision fees, fees for applying for the public defender, fees for using the public defender, fees for drug testing, fees when they swab your cheek to put your DNA in the database. They'll charge you a fee if you don't show up to court, and they issue a warrant, they'll issue a fee. If you're late paying your fees, they'll charge you a fee.
The White House action, a letter to OGE Director Walter M. Shaub Jr. from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, was first reported by The New York Times.

Even when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.

MARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?
Rubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of means testing, in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.
ELVING: When George Washington became our first president, we took a little time to establish the dollar as the currency for all states, but that got done over a Christmas session. For generations thereafter, Congress remained technically in session over Christmas, not out of disrespect, but just in case urgent business might require it. And the prospect of needing a Christmas session helped make the preceding weeks and months more productive. Deadlines, of course, are made to be stretched, and sometimes things got out of hand. Take the first Christmas of Lyndon Johnson's presidency in 1963.
But when Minnesota took up that invitation, the administration delayed its response. When it finally did grant permission last week, HHS also informed the state that it will lose significant funding for a program that provides insurance to the state's low-income residents.

JON KALISH, BYLINE: It was Donald Trump, the wealthy New York builder and owner of the Generals, who first compared Flutie to Joe Namath. There are some who believe Trump has acquired players like Flutie and running back Hershel Walker to aid the USFL's anti-trust suit against the NFL. One sports columnist described Trump's motivation this way - Donald Trump knows the only way for the NFL to accept Donald Trump is for the Generals to have players the NFL needs. In any event, Trump says Flutie is good for his team and the league.

But what has happened in the misdemeanor system is that bail has morphed into a tool for raising money, for extracting fines and fees from individuals and has contributed to a sort of misdemeanor version of mass incarceration. Many jurisdictions have bail schedules, a set list of fees for various low-level offenses.
It has to be on request, she says. We simply can't compete with the cost of other imported squid.
These are the kinds of districts that could see an unintended consequence of political gerrymandering. By trying to squeeze out a maximum number of Republican districts by splitting up much of Austin and San Antonio and stretching them out to more solidly Republican areas, it could potentially mean a more competitive race in a big wave year.
The tax would make natural gas more expensive to produce and deter fracking in Pennsylvania. The industry has created tens of thousands of jobs and led to savings for residential customers who buy natural gas, Turzai said. The debt is a problem. Turzai said the plan would create a debt-financed slush fund to be allocated at the whim of a new government board. Spending money on infrastructure, rural broadband, stormwater management and brownfield cleanup are worthy projects. But he said, when it comes to broadband, we do take issue with subsidizing multi-billion-dollar corporations to deploy technology using money from taxpayers.

I instead worked in a lot of offices and restaurants and things like that.

As many people know, after his football-playing days ended, Kemp served as a member of Congress for nine terms, representing western New York. He was often quoted as saying his football career served him well as preparation for his later and longer career in politics because, according to a version quoted by The Associated Press, by the time he got into office he had been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about a part of the criminal justice system that my guest describes as trapping the innocent and making America more unequal - the massive misdemeanor system. Depending on where you are, some misdemeanors are as minor as jaywalking. But the consequences of being charged with a misdemeanor, whether you are guilty or not, can be life-changing, especially if you are poor. My guest, Alexandra Natapoff, is the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime. Critics of how the criminal justice system deals with misdemeanors have described it as assembly line justice or McJustice.
In Diabetes Fight, Lifestyle Changes Prove Hard To Come By In Mexico
In general, most people should avoid variable annuities because they have high costs and their tax benefits are often overstated. But true lifetime fixed annuities do make a lot of sense, if one can avoid the large commission loads. In essence, they help replace the former pension plans. Be patient and shop around. I would get quotes from several leading annuity providers: MassMutual, MetLife, New York Life, State Farm, TIAA (if you qualify). Look for a firm with an A.M. Best Company rating of at least A+, the best being A++. IncomeSolutions.com provides quotes with low commissions for some other companies.
Also important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.
Trump administration officials said they don't think advertising is cost-effective, but Lodes wrote that my office produced reams of data that proved the overall effectiveness of outreach advertising.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complained that Democrats weren't involved in the drafting of the bill but said he wanted to work with Republicans to get something done quickly. In a statement on Thursday evening, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that to earn their support, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers.

Trump and Clinton had a similar basic message on trade: I'm for trade deals; just not these trade deals.
Former Buffalo Bills quarterback turned political leader Jack Kemp died over the weekend. He was 73. Many people probably remember him because he was such a popular figure on the talk show circuit, both while he was in office and after he left. And because he was such an eager advocate for whatever he believed in — sometimes too eager — interviewing him was a challenge because it was hard to get a word in edgewise, even a question.
After a Democratic primary that was rife with generational tensions, Biden has so far managed to hold together the Democratic coalition that elected him, including the young people who turned out for Biden in droves. Now, younger Americans are confronting the intersecting crises of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, a national reckoning on race and justice and the urgent climate crisis.

Democrats were bracing for the measure to be removed from the bill, and the path to an increase is much more difficult in the Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. Senate Republicans are almost uniformly opposed to the plan, and a stand-alone bill to increase the minimum wage, introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 37 co-sponsors, meaning a number of Democrats may not back the idea.

Despite the vast differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, there were some striking similarities between the economic speeches they delivered this week. They both spoke in Michigan, where they both talked a lot about manufacturing, with both of them insisting that they would obtain fairer trade deals.
GROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.
GROSS: Did any of the, like, food restaurant bar kind of jobs you have have a theatrical aspect to it, like a piano bar or anything like that?
Like Trump, she linked tougher trade policy to boosting manufacturing jobs. However, she also touted other specific plans that fit with her innovation-themed speech, like expanding scientific research that can create entire new industries. She also touted a tax credit aimed at boosting low-income areas.
The protesters were organized by United We Dream, the immigrant youth organization. United We Dream is one of a number of youth-led groups in regular contact with the Biden administration on key policy issues. While these activists are encouraged by what some described as open lines of communication to the White House, they say they're waiting to see whether that translates into policy victories.
BALDWIN: I guess, you know, when I was young, my dad - I'm perfectly willing to see now that what I loved and what I was doing and what I was opening up my mind to was to communicate with my dad. He would come home from work. He'd lay on this day bed in the den of our house. There was a TV. And I'd sit in a chair and, you know, this was his sacred time, his alone time. No one could get near him or really, really bother him in the evening 'cause, you know, he'd get home sometimes, you know, 10, 11 o'clock. And sometimes I think he stayed away. Maybe he pretended he had a job at night, and he was really just doing something else.
The idea is the corporation could operate as a backstop, to submit minimum bids on the tracts and secure drilling rights in case no one else makes any offers. Then, at some point, it could partner with oil companies to do the actual drilling.

All we have at the local level is property taxes, Strimling says. It would be great if some of the revenue that's generated from this legalization could stay in the community where it's having the most impact.
Trump and Clinton both talked about taxes in terms of bringing overseas jobs into the U.S. Trump framed his plan for this as simple: he would drastically lower the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent — which is high among other advanced economies — to 15 percent, in an attempt to lure businesses into the country. (However, many U.S. businesses take advantage of tax breaks to pay far less than that 35 percent rate right now.)
Congress also should be no exception to the public health safeguards, they wrote in a March 18 letter to Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. We are undermining our unified, bipartisan message to the American people when we come together on a crowded House floor to vote.

The disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.
Voters in Maine and a handful of other states are deciding whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. One thing that could swing the vote is the possibility of millions of dollars in tax revenue from retail marijuana sales. Colorado was the first state in the country to roll out a tax scheme for legal marijuana in 2013, after recreational marijuana was legalized in 2012. So how are voters in Colorado spending the cash, and what should Maine voters expect?

It's the very definition of gerrymandering, Theriault said. By slicing up all those Democrats in San Antonio and Austin, they're able to have lots of Republicans in this area when you think of this as being a pretty progressive Democratic area.
Cohen provided members of Congress with what he said were documents that backed up his testimony, including a check signed by Trump that Cohen said was part of the reimbursement for paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels.
ELVING: But back in town, members felt entitled to speechify on the floor, prompting one of the few women in Congress at that time, Katharine St. George of New York, to suggest that they all just put their remarks in writing in the Congressional Record. Future generations yet unborn will be able to see them, she said, but those of us who are here on this Christmas Eve need not listen to them.
It's possible his administration could delay the environmental permitting process for companies that buy leases from the Trump administration. Or a Biden administration could try to buy the leases back.
RAINBOW: And I would do, you know, sort of horrible DIY kind of stop motion animation. It was really bad. And then I - you know, I had a bunch of friends. I grew up doing theater.

2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.
I think the governor's trying to take a very middle of the road approach to this — ensuring certain (environmental protections) on one side while still being able to take advantage, and grow an industry, and create jobs.
President Trump has proposed sending money directly to Americans to help blunt the economic impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, saying it's time to go big to boost the now-stalled economy.

GONYEA: On immigration, Castro spoke of his grandmother coming to the U.S. from Mexico. The fourth candidate to speak was John Delaney of Maryland. He's still little-known, though he's been actively campaigning for almost two years already. Delaney spoke of his proposal, labeled the Heartland Fair Deal. In it, he too calls for much greater investment in rural areas.
Wolf's support for petrochemicals raises climate worries as Pennsylvania tries to cut carbon emissions
Those who followed these events in real time may feel as if they are being dragged back through nightmares they would rather forget. At the same time, for those who have not been as focused on the daily and weekly ups and downs, this catalog may come with the force of revelation. For that reason alone, it is highly valuable.

Additionally, HHS announced late last week that it will shut down HealthCare.gov for maintenance from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. every Sunday during open enrollment, except for Dec. 10 – a step critics say could further undermine enrollment efforts.
Chinese imports did hurt a lot of U.S. workers, but most of that may now be in the rearview mirror. That's because so many factory workers already have been replaced, either by low-wage competitors in other countries, or by technology, just as farm laborers were replaced by tractors a century ago. Because of automation, U.S. manufacturers employ less than 9 percent of the U.S. workforce but generate more than 12 percent of GDP.
COSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.

Latest Trump Book, Once Again, Makes The Case That He's Incompetent, Narcissistic
As excerpts of the book appear in the Post, we can expect a blizzard of blowback from Trump. In fact, even before publication, he had begun tweeting insults to inoculate his followers against any infection from Rucker and Leonnig's labors — calling Rucker Mr. Off-the-Record and suggesting that the Post's nasty White House bureau chief should not be allowed back on the grounds.
Cohen also faulted Trump for remarks that Cohen called racist and for his years as a con man, treating nearly everyone as a sucker and using his political aspirations as an infomercial for himself — not as a way to serve the United States as the holder of its highest office.
Biden's itemized financial disclosure shows that his income came mostly from his book Promise Me, Dad about his late son Beau Biden and the book tour that accompanied its release. He also made over $2 million from other paid speaking engagements, an average of over $127,000 per event. Event companies, universities, and community groups were among those who provided for Biden's paid speeches, but not major corporations or industry groups.

The main advantage of buying annuities on a deferred basis is that you can often lock in annuity payment rates today, well before you retire, when your rates can be different. You can also buy a deferred annuity after you retire, for example, to start at age 80, after you think that you will have exhausted your other resources.

Not so fast, argues Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas, Austin who studies global food systems. Commodity subsidies are a small part of a bigger problem, he writes in an editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine alongside the new study.
I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. — Donald Trump
Warren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.
Life, Trump said when asked what they talked about. We discussed life.
The proposal offers a path to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. There have been steep political challenges to moving immigration legislation through Congress, and Republicans have already signaled resistance to Biden's legislation.

Right now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We must stop that, and we must make them pay back tax breaks they ever received from any level of government in our country. And for those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they're gonna have to pay a new exit tax.

After decades of cuts to DEP under both Democratic and Republican administrations, it's the first time proposed spending from the general fund for environmental protection has risen above $165.6 million, the level it reached in 1994-1995, according to former DEP Secretary David Hess.
The rate is cause for concern because the decennial census is designed to count every person in the United States, wrote the report's researchers, noting that the actual response rate may be lower.
The joint event with congressional Democratic leaders marks the start of a concerted push by the White House to promote the American Rescue Plan around the country.

Rainbow performs each song within a video that typically also includes him interviewing Trump, a trick Rainbow accomplishes by re-editing videos of Trump interviews and inserting himself asking the questions and reacting to the answers. These YouTube videos go viral, and that's a tribute to Rainbow's clever lyrics, his great singing voice and hilarious reaction shots.
The lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.

Jurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.
RAINBOW: A little bit. I was so scared out of my wits that, you know, not much came out. But yeah, I had some interactions.
I said, you got trouble, my friends. Right here - you got trouble right here in America. Sure, I'm a liberal and a gay, I'm mighty proud to say. Well, I'm kind of scared to say it.

Coke in Mexico has more than 1.5 million places that sell Coke, Calvillo says. The presence of these products is everywhere. Calvillo was one of the advocates behind the 2014 soda tax, although he would have liked the tax to have been even higher. A higher tax, he argues, would have pushed down consumption even more and given the government more resources to combat the lifestyle that's linked to diabetes. In indigenous communities in Chiapas, he says, parents put Coke in baby bottles for their infants and the government isn't doing anything. It's crazy.

Of course I disagree with the president on certain policies, but I think you've got to look at the overall package and say, 'Is the president leading?' And give the president the room to lead, Roy told KXAN-TV in Austin. And I think a lot of people in Congress, including Sen. Cruz and others, are giving the president the room to step out and lead and drive forward, and we're seeing the benefit of that.

Leah Stokes, a scientist at the University of California Santa Barbara who studies climate and politics, says promoting any new fossil fuels at this point — even natural gas — could tip the world over the edge of climate catastrophe by midcentury. Stokes said that even 80 percent carbon reductions would be insufficient to the scale of the climate crisis.
5. Republicans could take another shot at a full overhaul next year — or even this year.
Other Democrats have begun highlighting areas that they say fall short. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he is disappointed that the bill doesn't have sufficient funding for first responders and other front-line medical professionals, among other complaints.
It inadequately funds federal, state, and local efforts on the ground to blunt the spread of this disease and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed, Leahy said in a statement. It fails to invest in programs the American people will rely on during this crisis, which have already begun to reach a breaking point.
Diabetes has mushroomed as Mexicans' lifestyles have changed dramatically over the last 40 years. Several generations ago diabetes was almost unheard of in Mexico. Now it's the leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization. Mexicans with indigenous ancestry have a genetic predisposition for the condition that makes them even more likely to develop it than Caucasians. But a key driver of Type 2 diabetes in Mexico — and globally — is still a person's diet.
I think instead we should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families that his plan ignores.

The bottom line here is, we have to figure out what it is that we want to do, and what it's going to take to be able to do it well, and hire the people with the skills to make that happen, and we don't have a very good system in the federal government right now for doing that, Kettl says.

Trump connected his manufacturing ideas with his plans for infrastructure and trade (for which, see above): he said that the goods used to produce this new infrastructure would be made in America, and he focused on foreign competitors (in particular China) whom he says have severely hurt American manufacturing.

It's essentially a lifetime commitment, and if you're not satisfied with the work, there's not much you can do about it, he says of a federal employee. With a contractor, if you're dissatisfied with the work, you just don't renew the contract.
As factory jobs continue to melt away, new trade deals, such as the TPP, will focus on non-manufacturing areas — such as intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, agricultural products and services, etc.

Barrientos says for too long health officials considered it the responsibility of patients to change their diet and exercise routines. They either did it or didn't.

NATAPOFF: The lack of resources in the misdemeanor system is one of the great challenges to the integrity of that process.

I signed a confidentiality agreement, and it didn't have an end date on it, he says with a small laugh. I can't comment on it, in terms of what I saw.
GROSS: So wait a minute. You're charged a fee for paying - paying for your own incarceration in jail. And you're charged a fee to have a public defender and - when the whole idea of having a public defender is that it's a free lawyer to represent you.

The traditions, while some of them are great, Priebus said, I think it's time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen.
Cohen's opening statement addressed directly his history of lying — yes, he said, he had lied many times in the past. But, he said, that was when he was in Trump's thrall, and those days are over.
Using smartphones to submit people's census information back to the bureau through the Internet did help boost the workers' productivity for the test run in Providence County. Still, Census Bureau officials say they plan to adapt their recruiting efforts for the actual head count.
And offering remote jobs can mean gaining — or losing — an edge in attracting and retaining talent. Lewis predicts a big bump in the number of job listings touting that a position can be at least partly remote.
The DEP would get $171.6 million from the general fund in Wolf's proposed budget. Other sources of funding for the agency would result in a total budget of $553.8 million.

While the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.
While severance tax talk continued in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's natural production has skyrocketed. In 2017, the Commonwealth accounted for 19 percent of total U.S. natural gas production — more than any other state, except Texas.
Book-length critiques of the presidency of Donald Trump keep piling up on American reading tables, so it seems time for a one-volume wrapup on what we have learned so far.

Wolf argues that, because natural gas is distributed across state lines, Pennsylvania residents end up paying for the cost of severance taxes in other states.
And those prior verbal tiffs are not insignificant.
We like to talk about it as if you were walking home today and you found a $20 bill on the ground, Stiffler explains. You wouldn't go home and buy a new car or new house. But you would maybe go out for a Chipotle burrito with guacamole and a margarita, right?

And surely by now the government and banks would want to be done with this Puerto Rican bond business. Rating agencies downgraded Puerto Rican bonds to junk. I asked Puerto Rico's current governor, Ricardo Rossello, what he thought of this period, and he put it this way.
According to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, 62% of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the pandemic so far.
But the answer is not to rant and rave – or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would end up killing even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. So my message, my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President. — Hillary Clinton
GROSS: Was he ever in therapy?
But annuities can also be overpriced, opaque, terrible products, too. So how do you figure out if an annuity is right for you? And if you think it is, how do you buy a good one that's not an overpriced turkey with massive hidden fees?
RAINBOW: Oh, let me think - raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, destroying the First Amendment, white nationalists.
More recently, the notion of Christmas carols being sung on the Senate floor got real in the first year of President Obama's presidency.
There's far less agreement among researchers on the effects of choice for the students who choose to leave their traditional public school.
Much more hopeful is Unassisted Human Flight, which follows a reporter wrapping up his stint at a small-town North Carolina newspaper with one last big article: a story about an eight-year-old boy who, decades back, was carried by a tornado and left unharmed. The boy, now an engineer in his 40s, initially resists the reporter's entreaties to talk to him, reluctant to revisit the storm that killed his twin brother.
Here in the U.S., the negative response to the commission's Apple ruling went beyond the Treasury Department. Republicans and Democrats in Congress condemned it, calling the decision a money grab. All this comes after Apple has been criticized in the last few years for avoiding taxes here in the States by setting up subsidiaries in Ireland. To understand this, I spoke with Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at USC.
SULLIVAN: Say your last name again.
NPR and PBS's FRONTLINE have investigated the devastating toll of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and how the federal response, Wall Street and a century of colonial neglect left 3.5 million Americans struggling to survive.

Biden and his wife, Jill, have together earned more than $15 million since Biden left office. That's according to tax returns and other financial disclosure forms released by Biden's campaign on Tuesday. The bulk of the Bidens' earnings come from book sales and paid speaking engagements – two routine sources of income for former high-ranking public officials.
He also took a moment to thank Merkel for Germany's continued support of the war effort in Afghanistan and for its role as a counter-ISIS coalition member.
BALDWIN: Well, I think that, you know, the year ahead of me was kind of a gut year, as they used to say. I don't know if they use that term now. But I had done all my hard classes in my sophomore and junior year and got involved in student politics 'cause it interested me to a degree. And I wanted to go into politics and run for office and get a law degree to help supplement that or help to facilitate that. So I - my girlfriend broke up with me. I was in love with this woman when I was very young, and she said, I can't be with you 'cause you're not Jewish. Her grandparents told her to break up with me, and she did. Her grandparents said lose the shegetz boyfriend.
The president also faulted Pelosi and Democrats on Thursday for wanting goodies in coronavirus legislation that he said had nothing to do with what we're talking about. Those details weren't exactly clear.

BALDWIN: I mean, there were times my dad would, like, you know, grab you by the shirt and, like, slam you up against the wall when you were, like, 15. That was a different generation. I mean, my dad wasn't somebody who was beating us with a pool cue. But he was someone who would - and every time he'd lose his temper and he'd grab you - and he was a pretty tough guy. My father was a very physically powerful, very tough guy when he was, especially when he was younger. He deteriorated very quickly in his 50s and died when he was 55 years old of cancer. But he never really got a chance to see me do what I do.
RAINBOW: So for me it was heaven because I was sitting behind the desk, and at any given moment, Patti Lupone would call, or Elaine Stritch would walk through the front door. And I couldn't get over my life.
Clinton has said she wants to spend $275 billion over five years (with additional private spending, eventually). She's proposed an infrastructure bank — an idea that has been around in Washington for decades now (at times, with bipartisan support, though it has been more of a Democratic cause in recent years) but that continually fails to gain much traction.
NATAPOFF: We've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.
3) Base your standard consumption on the monies from the lifetime annuity plus Social Security.
At some point, we're gonna run out of easy things to do, said Wessel. The to do list is going to get more challenging — things that are going to take a little more political courage and bravery, or a little more muscle in persuading the rest of America, not just young progressives.
Republicans also said Cummings and Democrats have become so deranged by their animus toward Trump that they were willing to risk his negotiations in Vietnam.

All Californian fish processors are capable of dealing with squid, Pleschner-Steele says. However, it's not a money-making operation because people aren't willing to pay for it.
He's so frustrated that his group hired a billboard truck to drive in circles around the Capitol building and through the snowy streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Signs on the sides of the truck flash phrases in LED lights, including Support democracy. Support Utah's vote. A looping video advertisement urges residents to call lawmakers who don't respect the will of the people.
Rachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.
For the second time as president-elect, Trump tweeted an announcement of a scheduled press conference, this time on Jan. 11.
He argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.
Communities like the Bronx, she says, need to be counted accurately so that they get their fair share of the hundreds of billions of federal tax dollars distributed based on census numbers.
Cohen told Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., about the practices used within the Trump Organization to take the real value of a building and make it appear greater, which would in turn make Trump appear to be richer.
And that of course opens a lot of questions about sustainability, he says. Can you really sustain a public health system with 17 percent of your population being diabetic? Especially if you are not prepared to control that diabetes.
So far, Utah lawmakers remain unconvinced by studies like Ward's. The bill to restrict Medicaid expansion is moving fast, and could reach the governor's desk as soon as next week.
I think if we get this right, these are going to be jobs that stay here, he told a group of local officials in Beaver County in 2016.
COSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.

The facts and circumstances should have given the FDA the authority to have rejected the application, which they did not do, the says.
And she brought a lawsuit. She asked the Supreme Court to hold that it's unreasonable for police officers to effectuate what we call full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, lock someone up, book them, take them to jail for a crime like hers, for which she could not have gone to jail. It was a fine-only traffic offense. And the Supreme Court ruled against her.
They know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment, explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn.

RAINBOW: Can you believe it? You mentioned Sondheim. But I have, I'm happy to say, heard from most of the composers that I have parodied - everyone from Sondheim to Steven Schwartz to Andrew Lloyd Webber. So everyone is pretty much on board. So I have that in my corner, too.
NPR's Ari Shapiro talks to Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at the University of Southern California, about the implications of the Apple tax ruling for U.S. companies in Europe.
What's interesting is when you listen to people on Capitol Hill, including Republicans in Senate leadership, they are really only talking about two of the president's four pillars. In other words, they want border security and wall funding in exchange for some kind of a path to legalization or citizenship for the DREAMers. They think a smaller, more narrow deal is more doable. So most Republicans also think that Donald Trump will sign whatever Congress sends him on immigration. Otherwise, he has to start deporting the DREAMers. Either way, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that he would put a bill on the floor this week with an open process. That means amendments, votes, old fashioned legislating - something we haven't seen in a very long time in Washington.
JERRY BROWN: I've often used the phrase from Thomas Hobbes, bellum omnes contra omnes - or rather, bellum omni contra omnes.

GROSS: That's great that the songwriters really love your work.
A lifetime, or fixed, annuity pays you a constant amount of money until you die, sometimes called longevity protection. Since no one knows how long they'll live, a fixed annuity is similar to Social Security, except most lifetime annuity payments are not indexed to inflation. Overall, it's a very simple product.
John Kasich: If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. Donald Trump: I will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security....I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.
BALDWIN: I was just terrified. I mean, that's what - other people who we grew up with, those dads had other things to withhold from their kids to control them. You can't use the boat this weekend. I'm going to take your car away. I'm going to take your allowance away. We had none of that. My father had nothing to give to us, you know, in addition to what was normal - our clothes and food and housing and if we needed money for certain - specific expenses related to our school and trips. But he wasn't handing out allowances ever. That was just - it didn't happen. We had to go out and earn our own money. And so the only thing he had was the fear program.
You always wanted to get back to New York and try Broadway. So when you got to New York when you were in your 20s, what did you audition for, and what were those auditions like?
Kemp will be missed for many reasons, not least because he demonstrated that conservative principles can be argued without the subtext of race-baiting and nativism, to which so many of his peers continue to resort when their electoral backs are against the wall. In fact, it strikes me that the Republican Party, of which Kemp was a committed member, and the traditional civil rights leadership, of which he was often an ally, face a similar quandary of maintaining relevance in a fast-changing country.
Germany and America are bound by their values: democracy, freedom, the respect for the law and the dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political position. On the basis of these values I offer the future president of the United States, Donald Trump, close co-operation.
Many experts agree: We need new thinking about how to incentivize more nutritious food choices at the retail level, especially given that the U.S. government spends far more on food assistance programs such as SNAP, aka food stamps, compared with crop subsidies.
4. The Trump administration is dragging its feet on giving states flexibility to stabilize their markets.
Russian intelligence officers stole emails from the Democrats and others as part of a concerted attack on the U.S. election, although it still isn't clear how much Trump and his campaign knew about Russia's efforts or whether the material WikiLeaks obtained had originated from the work of Russia's intelligence services.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, TRUMP'S FAVORITE THINGS!)
The results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.
Trump likewise in his speech touted infrastructure spending, though he didn't get into detail. However, he has explained those details elsewhere: he has seemed close to Clinton on the idea that something like an infrastructure bank would be the way to fund those projects, as the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos wrote earlier this year, with Americans buying infrastructure bonds.
The math is unforgiving, Samaras said. Infrastructure lasts for a long time and a…plant can run for 30, 40, 50, even longer — 60 years. If we think about a budget that Pennsylvania can use, each new fossil (fuel) infrastructure asset is going to use up some of that budget.
Sherk adds that without a hiring freeze, agencies have less incentive to look for fat to cut. You're not looking for the efficiencies, because you don't need to find them.
While some Utah lawmakers, such as Christensen, describe being philosophically opposed to Medicaid expansion, much of the political debate in Utah is about how much expansion will cost, and whether the new sales tax will pay for it. Supporters point to the fiscal experience of other states.
In January 2016, a Pew poll showed that global trade was not a hot-button issue, at least not when compared with much bigger concerns about economic growth, terrorism and education.
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. We've devoted this week to revisiting interviews with some of this year's Emmy nominees. Today's guests are Alec Baldwin, nominated for his guest work playing President Donald Trump on NBC's Saturday Night Live, and Brian Tyree Henry, nominated for two different Emmys, one for comedy, for his role as Paper Boi on the FX series Atlanta and one for drama for a guest appearance on NBC's This Is Us.
After weeks downplaying the risk of the virus and dismissing the suggestion that the U.S. economy was headed toward a dramatic slowdown, Trump has made a turn this week, taking on a more somber and ominous tone about the impact the pandemic will have.
GROSS: I think, for some areas, the police are expected to - or may be required to - pull over a certain number of people per month. Like, there's a quota. And I'm wondering if you think that contributes to problems within the misdemeanor system.
Utah residents may have thought they were done fighting about Medicaid expansion last November. But when Utah lawmakers opened a new legislative session in late January, they began pushing through a bill to roll back the scope and impact of an expansion that voters approved by in a ballot measure.
He understands climate change, believes that it is already having an impact on Pennsylvania and is proposing to address it, Minott said.
How high would the tax be?
The irony here is that if the goal is to make government work better to try to get it more under control, the hiring freeze is exactly the opposite of what you need to do, Kettl says.
Students are never randomly assigned to a school. A school's population is always affected by local demographics. With schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.
NATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.
Trump's rejection of trade deals fits with one of his own broader campaign narratives: rejecting the establishment. Many Republicans — and, importantly, the Chamber of Commerce, which has given heavy financial support to Republican candidates — support free trade. This is just one way Trump thumbs his nose at more traditional Republican ideas.

Meadows also invited an official from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, who was a former Trump employee. She stood up at the hearing. If Trump is a racist as Cohen charged, Meadows asked, why did he hire Patton, a black woman?
That's the way I want to go. I just want to get it done and have a big infusion, as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days, Trump said. We want to go big.

Florida, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who rely on Social Security. At the GOP debate in Miami Thursday night, candidates were asked about their plans for the program.
Initially, Dec. 15 was to be the day Trump would hold his first press conference since winning the election. But it never happened, canceled before a time and place had been set. It was supposed to be about how Trump would address his potential business conflicts of interest as president. The rescheduled press conference has no such promised focus.
Under IRS regulations, an admission of self-dealing by the leader of a nonprofit foundation can lead to a fine.
At the time Mexico was the leading per capita consumer of soda in the world. In regulatory filings in 2015, Coca-Cola said that the annual consumption of its beverages in Mexico was more than 600 8-ounce servings per person per year. That means that, on average, every Mexican was drinking nearly two glasses of Coke beverages every day. And that doesn't even count the amount of Pepsi or other brands of soda being consumed.
TRUMP: He's a real personality, and he's very smart. He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.

Administration officials are also hitting the airwaves, with a White House official putting the tally at more than 100 national television, radio and podcast interviews since Jan. 21. This week alone, they've done some 30 local TV interviews in Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana and Colorado. This is a reprisal of Biden's campaign strategy: he traveled less due to the coronavirus, but he did a lot of local TV interviews to bring his message into voters' homes.
TRUMP: Look. The entire thing has been a witch hunt.
Just a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.

SULLIVAN: It's easy to fault Puerto Rican politicians for this. Why didn't they just cut spending, cut school budgets and police budgets and whatever else? But you could ask every voter the same question - who do you like better, the politician who takes away all your favorite programs and gives you nothing, or the one who tells you can have everything you want and someone else will pay for it 20 years from now? Puerto Ricans chose the latter. They turned to investment banks to come in and put the bond deals together.

To me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.

Like nearly every pragmatic elected official across the political spectrum, Governor Wolf recognizes the compelling environmental and economic benefits of clean-burning American natural gas, said Marcellus Shale Coalition president David Spigelmyer, in a statement.

Back then, it relied on seismic testing from a decade prior, technology that's now outdated. It found that anywhere from about 4 to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil could lie beneath the federal lands. That's a whole lot of oil, but also a very large range of uncertainty, Houseknecht says. The seismic data that we have are quite old, low resolution and a sparse grid.

Carlos Capacete said he got his start in Puerto Rico's Golden Mile in the 1980s.

But I think it's absurd that he would be doing that in the direction of anybody - any kind of comedy programming that's parodying him or commenting on him, whether it was Jon Stewart in his day and so forth or Colbert now. I find it amazing that he's doing that. And then when you think about it's me that he's doing it with, I find that even more surreal.
Maine, like a lot of other states, could always use more revenue, so the possibility of millions from legalizing marijuana is enticing. But many voters there are unsure how that money will be spent.

But much to my chagrin, the first show they took me to was Cats.
Many of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.

cohen: it may be that president trump is fulfilling his negotiating strategy by setting out an extreme position and then having it walk back to something that's more responsible. if it is and it works, ok, he'll get credit for that. but to the extent that he unsettles our allies and encourages others to take action thinking that he is serious, then it could pull down the pillars that have been established over the past 50 or 60 years.

it's hard to predict how the republican-led legislatures in florida and texas will respond to the recent shootings. the scale of the orlando shooting, the deadliest in recent history, makes it different from previous incidents. and the fact that the five victims of the dallas shooting were law enforcement officers, not citizens, makes it different as well.

schmidt: well, that is if they could get out of detention. but, of course, the administration has announced that they're going to detain 100 percent of the new arrivals who cross at a place other than a port of entry. and they're going to expedite their cases. in fact, the president, as part of his executive order, ordered a new round of aimless docket reshuffling, which means those cases will go to the top of the front of the line. other cases that are ready to be heard will go to the back of the line. and judges that are handling dockets here and in other places will, in all likelihood, be moved to the border to hear these cases leaving nobody to hear the cases on their dockets - in arlington, new york, chicago, los angeles, wherever they regularly sit. so it will be a total mess in my view.
estrin: he said the law does not infringe upon individual rights of citizens but does prevent collective national rights for non-jews. he said the law would ensure israel accepts jewish immigrants while preventing palestinian noncitizens from gaining citizenship. israeli columnist shmuel rosner says many israelis support the law, partly in reaction to international activists leading a boycott campaign against israel.
so you've reported that alex azar of health and human services and seema verma of medicare and medicaid both want to please president trump. how have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? and is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? in other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in trump's good graces?

inskeep: is the president's tough talk to adversaries or potential enemies really that much different than other presidents? i'm thinking about the way that president obama, before the iran nuclear deal, made a blanket statement - iran's not going to get a nuclear weapon. it would have been hard to mistake that as anything but a threat.
the democrat party has never been more outside the mainstream. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, trump said. he criticized democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.
establishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a limit on emissions is one option. the state could also boost its alternative energy portfolio standard, a law that requires a certain percentage of the state's power mix come from renewables. those ideas will be tough to get through a republican-led legislature.

and in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by democrat beto o'rourke. the former texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat gop sen. ted cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a white house bid that could especially challenge trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a southern border wall.
fuller clark: well, i think that bernie deserves a lot of credit for having changed the conversation in terms of policy within the democratic party. that was very strong in 2016. but what he's promising - is it really realistic to be able to achieve those goals under his administration and his leadership? i don't think that that's viable in this country at this time from what i see and what i understand.

third, the process is mired in bureaucracy. the disinterments jpac does approve must go through additional government layers to the defense pow/missing personnel office, which has its own historians check the work, then to the assistant secretary of the army for final approval. while these steps tend to be a rubber stamp — the army has never turned jpac down — dna can't be collected and tested until remains are disinterred, and a disinterment can't happen until all of those steps are completed.
i spoke with him in early 1988 when he was a second-year law student at the university of pennsylvania. he went on to become active in veterans' causes and served as an adviser to the state department's prisoner of war/missing in action office. i asked him what the armed forces radio station in saigon sounded like when he got there.
inskeep: why would that be more likely?
pope francis accuses bishop's critics of slander, riling sex abuse victims in chile
jennings: yeah. i think senator romney, senator-elect romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. i recall back in the summer, he wrote in the salt lake tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. he said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. i think he's also doing what a lot of republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. and that is not something that is unique to mitt romney. a lot of republican voters did that when they voted for donald trump in 2016. so mitt romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. and i expect he'll keep doing that.
schmidt: well, i don't think he understands the law and the constitution. according to the supreme court, everybody in the united states, regardless of status, has a right to due process under law. and you're not going to get due process from more border patrol agents. you're going to have to get judges of some type - give individuals fair hearings before an impartial decision-maker.
vice president mike pence: the united states will continue to work with japan and with all our allies in the region, including south korea, to confront the most ominous threat posing this region of the world - the regime in north korea.
the president shapes the public character of the nation. trump's character falls short. that is a quote, an excerpt. actually, the headline of a scathing new washington post op-ed by mitt romney. the former massachusetts governor and republican presidential candidate praised president trump's tax cuts and his hard line on china. but the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the united states by a new senator from his own party. this comes as trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.

lehigh university has revoked an honorary degree that president trump held for more than 30 years. the pennsylvania school's board of trustees held a special vote this week after trump incited an insurrection at the u.s. capitol.
greene: so it almost sounds like donald trump had this line from the 1980s and maybe he's using the same line for a country that really has changed a lot?
kelemen: there are some signs that trump may already be moderating his positions. he says he's still studying whether to move the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. arab leaders have been privately urging him not to do that, and they've raised concerns about the israeli government's plans to expand settlements in the west bank. trump had a message for netanyahu on that today, too.

to try to move cases through more quickly, the trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. however, under former attorney general jeff sessions, the department of justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. if reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.
greene: so trade is the other big issue here on this visit. the trump administration, as we know, has pulled out of the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement that was so prominent on the campaign trail. and they keep talking about, quote, bilateral agreements. what is the point of stressing that word?
some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. and if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.

the couple's prolific political giving led to what was sometimes called the adelson primary, in which gop presidential hopefuls would flock to las vegas to court adelson and the republican jewish coalition.
trump even appeared cowed wednesday by leaving it. on trump's exit from the white house, he stopped to talk to reporters. he looked back a few times at the place he would be leaving behind — and even thanked the media.
a return to normal may mean a return to the same old passive-aggressive polite gridlock mixed with partisan bickering. democrats control the white house and both chambers of congress, but only very narrowly. biden will likely need republicans for most of his major legislative agenda items, including his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, a comprehensive immigration overhaul or almost anything else.

in an interview last week with the conservative radio show host hugh hewitt, pompeo said he never heard that yovanovitch may have been under surveillance. in her testimony before the house, yovanovitch said she was told by the state department that she was being recalled because of concerns about her security.
with less than a dozen days left in power, the trump administration on friday approved a radically different medicaid financing system in tennessee. with this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from washington, allowing tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.

there are a bunch of technical preferences that can throw you onto the amt, and it looks like donald trump fell afoul of one or two of them, burman says.
they may share trump's pro-business agenda, but find it difficult to ignore his personal behavior, ulrich said.
it's not a new idea. in fact, oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity — $8.4 trillion in 2018 — with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity — $1.4 trillion. the reports coincide with the world economic forum, where elites gather in davos, switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.
the question of whether we've abdicated, though, is a - much more than a trump question because this really began in the obama administration. president obama was much less committed to the american global role. and, you know, let's set aside these questions of exceptionalism that's obsessed, you know, the front pages but just less committed to an american leadership profile abroad...
so how america responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most americans don't know much about. so let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. let's start with alex azar, who's the head of health and human services. he took over after tom price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.

denman was steam rolled, said melinda haring of the atlantic council, a washington, dc, think tank, who believes the language the trump campaign approved is weaker. and she says it's anyone's guess what trump would do regarding ukraine and russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.
cronauer: and then i would say, good morning, vietnam, and then start into the program that way.
adelson made his fortune — a net worth of around $35 billion according to an estimate by forbes — in the casino hotel industry. he spent much of it backing conservative politicians in the u.s. and israel, shaping the political debate of both countries.
what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.
qannam beat out a diverse mix of 23 other contestants, who held election rallies and critiqued sitting ministers. he is from east jerusalem, which palestinians hope will be the capital of a future state, and is the son of refugees — two traits he says made him popular in the west bank.

thompson: well, there's no real correlation between border security and this shutdown. the president has tried to manufacture and up the ante by this shutdown. we have some 800,000 employees. we have 450 airports in this country manned by tsa workers who may or may not get paid this friday. that's not how you run an effective system of national security for those who travel. our coast guard individuals, as you know, recently got paid because of a unique formula for handling the money. i'm not certain that they will be able to do it next time. those men and women of tsa and the coast guard do a wonderful job.
under the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a close causal relationship to the project. that could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.
now, there are also new things. japan wants to export more of its products like high-speed railways at a time when president trump would like to build more infrastructure in the u.s. and also remember that in 2011 following the fukushima earthquake and nuclear disaster, japan shut down its nuclear plants. so now japan is a very good market for u.s. exports of oil and natural gas.
but until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. the oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.

whether this change in the way tennessee's medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. the incoming biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.

cities, states, localities in the united states do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. and some in california have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. california governor gavin newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. so if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.

gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?

the trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. and the selection of a rally in el paso was no accident either — trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the u.s. border town compared to its mexican counterpart. however, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in el paso.
he worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like charles testerman, who came to lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. he drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. when he couldn't afford heroin, he bought suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. it didn't work.

pletka: actually, i think venezuela is a real success story for this administration and in a very conventional way, actually. you know, here we see that the administration actually did some homework. they built the foundations. they worked with our allies. they worked with the multilateral, in this case, the organization of american states. they really have brought together, you know, a coalition of, at this point, dozens of countries that recognize the now constitutional leader of venezuela, mr. guaido. and they are ratcheting up pressure in ways that are, i think, quite careful.
on a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. in some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said ruhm. in the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.
it's absolutely the goal we need, but the market by itself is not going to get us there. we really need to do it through policy, said mark szybist, senior attorney with the natural resources defense council.
estrin: after impassioned debate, israeli lawmakers narrowly passed the nation state law last month. the law downgrades the arabic language in israel from official to special status and commits resources to jewish settlement. critics say that could lead to an unequal distribution of land and resources. palestinian-arab citizens have long complained of discrimination, but the druze community's outcry is something new.

diamond: about two weeks ago, my colleague nancy cook and i reported that the white house had soured on alex azar leading the coronavirus response. he was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on capitol hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in politico. but by the end of the day, mike pence had replaced him. and by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, debbie birx, to help run the response, too. that's what people saw in public.

marion county's ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.
in late january, senator elizabeth warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the american conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. it's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. warren calls the policy her ultra-millionaire tax. it would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.

diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.

but biden draws a lot of his support from older voters, and at his events over the last few days, the crowds have been filled more with baby boomers than millennials.
preble: well, actually, danielle and i agree on the importance of trade, and i think the president has taken a bad step in the wrong direction on that. but in terms of u.s. leadership, we have to remember where this all started. after world war ii, the entire world was shattered, and the few countries that were capable of doing anything about it, one of them was the soviet union. and so in that context, i was pretty happy to see the united states take a leading role. but it's striking to me that danielle mentions russia and china and even iran regionally but not any of the other countries in the world - of which there are roughly 190 other countries in the world - which might actually take a more leading role, at least in their own region. and, again, that's why i point back to what's happened in venezuela and the response of other countries in the region. i just...

qannam smiles brightly, but also a little bashfully. he's not the real palestinian president. he just played one on tv.
his solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the european experiments. so he suggested a global wealth tax: the whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. that such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.
take the jeongseon alpine venue. we've had people over there since early november, and they pretty much made snow from november 15 until about january 10, vanderkelen says. they converted around 200 million gallons of water into snow during that time and then stored it until the games began.

the racers like a very hard surface that minimizes rutting, so that between the 40 and 60 competitors that might race they're trying to keep that surface as consistent as they can as they carve those gates and those corners, vanderkelen says. so they really like a very hard surface, and they don't like natural snow at all.
chang: ok. so now let's talk about the secretary of state nomination. the front-runner now, according to multiple news outlets, is oil executive rex tillerson. he's the ceo of exxonmobil. no confirmation yet, but if trump chooses tillerson, what would that say about his foreign policy plans, and what does that signal to the rest of the world?
o'brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. but he is optimistic about the odds. major agencies like the international monetary fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the world economic forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.
senator romney has expressed his concerns to chairman johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle, said spokeswoman liz johnson. he will therefore vote to let the chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.
diamond: the trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. and there is some truth to that. now tests have been churned out. but the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. and even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.
the show, broadcast on the maan satellite network, was popular — and he is recognized on the streets of ramallah — in part because he's the closest palestinians have gotten to choosing a leader in more than a decade. the real president of the palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a five-year term.

egyptians and jordanians are no big fans of israel, yet the peace itself stuck. if the two sides get their interests met - their interests for the palestinians is about independence and dignity - they would be - you would have a stable peace deal. for the israelis, it's about security and recognition. you get these components, you get a peace. peace is not about love. it's about accommodation.
trump: i'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. we'll work something out, but i would like to see a deal be made. i think a deal will be made.
costello: well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then i can't support you.

it was the summer of 2015. i was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. and she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that mona, the water isn't being treated properly in flint. and because of that, there's probably lead in the water. and that's the moment that my life changed. when i heard the word lead, it was a call to action. i respect the science of what lead does. i understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. and i also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. it's the last thing our kids in flint needed. that's the moment i stopped sleeping, i stopped eating, i lost about 30 pounds. and i began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.

democrats are hoping to buck the trend and tighten gun laws in the red state, proposing to ban gun sales to people on federal watch lists — similar to legislation that's being debated nationally.
and that's certainly a pressing issue. even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the world bank has warned that progress is slowing. what's more worrying, according to oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.

the researchers looked at legislation that was proposed following mass shooting events between 1990 and 2014, and their research found two major things: mass shootings do increase the amount of gun-related bills that get proposed and passed; the nature of that legislation — whether it tightens or loosens gun laws — depends on the dominant political party and ideology of the state.

according to nbc news, o'rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. and bloomberg news reported that o'rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. at various points during his own rally, trump claimed that 69,000 people had rsvp'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. but nbc news reported that trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.

but at this point, we do not have, from the white house, any clear directive on what the country should do. and with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.

but trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally o'rourke, el paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily democratic city. exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, trump claimed that o'rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.

jennings: well, he works at the speed of the institution. i mean, i think most republicans said after the election that if donald trump had issues with the votes that he should take it to court. that's the proper venue for the adjudication of claims. he did that. every single court that looked at it did not agree. the electoral college met. and that's immediately when mitch mcconnell acknowledged that joe biden was the president-elect. and then yesterday, after the president would not stop indulging this fantasy that the election was stolen, mitch mcconnell took to the senate floor and made a powerful speech. and i thought, frankly, it was one of his finest hours. it's regrettable that he had to actually give that speech.

metro by t-mobile used to be a regional cell phone company a few years ago and has now branched out nationwide. metro uses t-mobile's hspa+ and lte network, as it is owned entirely by the larger carrier. t-mobile's network has become one of the strongest networks in populated areas but even with all of the improvements, you should check the coverage map to be sure you're covered.
now, as president-elect, trump is sounding the same notes. he caused a veritable earthquake in u.s.-china relations just by taking a call from taiwan's president tsai ing-wen. this challenged the bedrock of u.s. relations, the one china policy, under which the u.s. officially recognizes only the government in beijing, though it also conducts business with taipei.
npr reporter mary louise kelly lied to me, twice. first, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record, he said. it is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. this is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt president trump and this administration. it is no wonder that the american people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.

for one thing, if trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. and experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.

diamond: ...to have someone tip me off because that is a question that i've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. the world health organization did have a working test. someone somewhere made the decision that the u.s. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.
inskeep: you think he saw the complexities. you think he actually has learned and changed here?
only after the sister's $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did she and grimes learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join medicare.
this approach is not unprecedented, says csis's green. typically, what happens in every case is that within a few months or a year or two, the policy calibrates and they go back to the norm.
kelemen: palestinians, though, are calling on trump and netanyahu to be clear about the alternatives - either a non-democratic israel that treats palestinians as second-class citizens or a country that no longer has a jewish majority. we reached hanan ashrawi of the plo's executive committee in ramallah.

democrats want to work on a sound border system, rep. thompson says
in a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, donald trump directed some of his strongest words toward china. he called the chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of america's leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on china.
ramachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. the oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.
but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.

the auditors had several recommendations, such as calling on facebook to do more to rein in hateful speech on its platform, and stricter penalties for users who post items that violate company standards.
jennings: well, you're right. they don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. but he ought to. in my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing daca. fixing daca was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. it's something he has endorsed before. that would give pause, i think, to this democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. a lot of these new members of congress ran on a fix for daca. i think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for daca. that's a win for everybody...

and there's an additional complication: disinterred remains that jpac can't identify end up sitting in boxes on shelves in a closet. most people agree that's not the way to honor soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice, and jpac told npr and propublica that the standard for disinterring u.s. service members is very high. they don't want to dig up remains unless they are pretty confident they can identify them.
shmuel rosner: a sense within israel and among many israelis that there is a growing tendency to delegitimize israel as the nation-state of the jewish people, to somehow argue that even being a nation-state is in some way not legitimate. so many israelis feel as if israel is under siege, and they felt the need to make a statement.

it was the reality, he said. the tests are just demonstrating what was.
diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.

it's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of french economist thomas piketty, whose book capital in the twenty-first century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with piketty in 2015, is the first u.s. presidential candidate to take up the cause.
the program the president sends a very strong message to the [palestinian] leadership and says, there is a real need for the democratic process, qannam says. the second message that it gives is the interest on the part of the youth to participate in making their ideas heard.
gross: in the movie, the robin williams version of adrian cronauer is censored when he wants to read the real news that comes across the wire. all the news that comes over the wire is first presented to censors. and in the movie, the character witnesses a bombing at a restaurant that a lot of the army men hang out in, and he's not allowed to mention that on the air. similar things happened to you?
the gardiner is not a good fit for every special-needs student. alicia points out that $10,000 doesn't go a long way for students who might need speech, occupational or behavioral therapy on a daily or weekly basis, as ewan did when he was younger. in dorothy's case, her children's therapies are paid for by medicaid, because she adopted them from medical foster care. but, a lot of parents who do have children with more complex needs are still left in limbo, alicia says.

it's a unique and ethically fraught clause that doesn't appear in any of the other operation warp speed contracts npr has reviewed. although the contract doesn't explicitly state that the company will vaccinate its workers ahead of people at higher risk of covid-19, it could have that effect. and extending vaccination to family members heightened concerns that the provision would mean delays for other people prioritized for immunization.
the news media has to hold leaders of all parties accountable. and biden will make his fair share of inaccurate or exaggerated claims, and he should be called out on them. but there's more of a chance now for public debates based on a shared set of facts, rather than alternative ones that never existed.

president trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.
liasson: well, what i make of it is there's not only a big breach between trump and the intelligence community. there's also a breach between trump and a bipartisan group of senators on capitol hill who say there should be hearings. there was the initial reaction from some republicans where they didn't want to undermine trump's victory, but other republicans want to get to the bottom of this. they consider this a cyberattack. they don't think it has anything to do with partisan politics. we also have the report that the obama administration has asked for to be completed before obama leaves office. that means it would probably come out right before trump's inauguration.
cronauer: whatever happened to be currently popular, again, looking at what were the popular songs in the states and assuming that the gis who came over from the states would want to hear what's popular back at home. our whole idea was whether it was in the music policy or the production that we did on the air, it was to make it sound as much as possible like a stateside radio station to give them a little link with home as a morale factor.
the supply is in addition to the commitments to the us, so the supply actually increases the capacity and number of individuals in [the] us who can be vaccinated, and in effect speeds up vaccination for those not in moderna's program, moderna spokesman ray jordan told npr.
while pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. and when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.

inskeep: now, mr. chairman, this is something the obama administration could have said. and in fact, they did say this is a very dangerous journey, it's hazardous for people, it would be better for many if they didn't come. is the president right?
and so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. you know, the party has to look inward. they have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. and that's where i think we'll be.

cohen: well, it takes a long time to build an alliance. it can be destroyed very quickly. and it seems to me there are some, including the president, but some in his administration that want him to act, what i would call, like a blind samson, pulling down the pillars that have been established since the end of world war ii. those pillars have been responsible for creating and sustaining peace, for the most part, globally, which has allowed a globalized economy to take place, which means many millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and that people who are not in desperate poverty are less likely to be trying to immigrate to other countries, overloading their borders, et cetera. if you take down the pillars, what replaces it?

goldstein, of the university of pennsylvania, says trump might be using tactics he learned in the business world, where you often stake out your toughest positions in the beginning.
many overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. according to ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. he estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.

also important, zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. and smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt european efforts. some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. it's true, but it creates a huge loophole: buy lots of art! economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.

gross: how did you sign on the first morning that you did your show?
cronauer: no. the reaction that's shown in the film is way overblown. we did not get mailbags full of letters and cards, and we did not have a bank of phones taking requests. first of all, there was nobody - no place where anybody could phone in from anyway. but secondly, there was a reaction that i would get mostly when i went out into the field. we would get an occasional card and letter. but if i'd go out doing interviews, people would say, you're who? and i'd say cronauer. and they'd say, oh, yeah, i think i - and i'd say, good morning - oh, yes, of course. and i found out later on that many times the gis, although the program was popular and they enjoyed it, if i'd do the good morning, vietnam, on a particularly bad day, they'd boo and hissed, and occasionally some would yell at their radio the gi equivalent of get stuffed, cronauer.

more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.

in 1990, twelve countries in europe had a wealth tax. today, there are only three: norway, spain, and switzerland. according to reports by the oecd and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.

diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.

thompson: well, there's no question it's a hazardous journey. we wish people wouldn't do it, but they are doing it. so what we have to do is address that situation in a humanitarian way. teargassing people who try to come, trying to direct them to areas hundreds of miles away from where they are - the right to seek asylum is guaranteed anyone who gets to our borders. so what we're trying to get the president understand is, sure, we have a broken system, but your zero-tolerance policy that was implemented without any policies and procedures has exacerbated the problem. so again, let me be very clear. democrats want to work on a sound border security policy, but we absolutely resist the notion that all this is predicated on building a wall.

cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.

he argues the warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. unlike in the european union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. existing u.s. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the caribbean, they're still on the hook. on top of that, warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.
inskeep: i want to be as clear as we can that the president, i think, if you talk about inviting japan to get nuclear weapons, he said different things. i think he may have even denied that he ever said the thing that he had in fact previously said. so he seems to have backed off. but it sounds like you're just arguing that that uncertainty about what the president means is the problem.

but, look; once the election was over and the claims had been adjudicated and the votes were counted, mitch mcconnell stuck by the institution and the norms and the gears of our democracy. and he was not about to let donald trump live in an alternate bubble. and i think the speech he gave yesterday were a recognition of that. and he - and - you know, convinced most of the republicans in the senate that the republicans should not indulge what donald trump was doing. it's, i think, pretty bad that a couple of them went ahead and voted to do it anyway.

to make comparisons of opportunity across significant expanses of time, we must directly face the question of what is inherently involved in good work and living well. and we must use what we learn to shape the institutional settings in which people live and work and not simply rely on the market incentives entailed by workers' occupational mobility. those incentives operate synchronically (in the present) and the problem of preserving opportunity over time is diachronic (stretching over time).

a related finding, which is very important for the pursuit of sustainability, is that escape from poverty is important to happiness but the pursuit of wealth, status, and image as life goals is less conducive to happiness than the pursuit of life goals that directly fulfill our basic forms of potential and satisfy our related psychological needs. societies that have promoted the accumulation of wealth without limit have not raised their general level of happiness by doing so. it should be evident to any observer of life in the u.s. that as wealth and inequality have grown, most americans have become more painfully focused on occupational insecurity and on status competition that has simply become more expensive and less sustainable.

according to this ideal, living well involves fulfilling one's human potential in ways that are admirable, sustainable, and personally satisfying. my work with ryan and deci identifies three broad forms of potential — social, intellectual, and productive/creative — the fulfillment of which is enabled by admirable personal qualities and is psychologically linked to the satisfaction of human beings' universal basic needs for positive relatedness, self-determination, and competence. fulfilling all three forms of potential is the key to happiness, and shaping our lives and institutions accordingly would be much more compatible with sustainability than pursuing wealth without limit.

diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.

i recognize that this is going to be a hard slog. maduro and his backers in havana are very, very committed to hanging on. they have that exploited the venezuelan people and the economy much to their personal financial advantage. and they don't want to let that go. but i do think the administration has actually shown a lot of skill in this area. i've been very impressed. and they've been quiet about it as well, which is something that we so rarely see from donald trump.
at the same time, iran has stepped away from key provisions of the nuclear deal. in an interview this month with npr, the country's foreign minister, mohammad javad zarif, said all limits on centrifuges used to enrich uranium are now suspended.
in this environment, it's easier for an executive to release a boilerplate statement condemning hatred than it is to open him or herself or their company up to the president's twitter-ranting, pearce said.
martin: i want to read a little more from this op-ed. basically, mitt romney is saying here that president trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. he says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. what is your former boss doing here? i mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.

at campaign events, biden has heavily featured freshman rep. abby finkenauer as a surrogate, who in 2018 flipped a republican district here in eastern iowa at age 29.
3. biden laid out his priorities.
they showed up to the meeting expecting an 'a' for attendance, rashad robinson, president of color of change told npr at the time.
fuller clark: right. there is no perfect candidate. what we're seeing over and over again is there still is a high number of undecided voters. it may be one reason why the turnout was less than had been predicted in iowa. i think on another level that voters are exhausted by the trauma of washington.
however, he pleaded with people not to rush out to a grocery store or gas station to stockpile essential goods.
costello: sure. and in fairness, i saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. and i think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. it's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.

former secretary of state john kerry has been making this joke at the last few events for joe biden: 70 is the new 50.
qannam seems prepared for that question.
kuhn: well, you know, japan feels that they worked so hard for so many years on the tpp. and they got a - what they thought was a pretty good deal. so basically they would like not to kill it off. they would like to keep the tpp alive with the other 11 countries, keep it in some form and then do a separate, perhaps, bilateral deal with the u.s. later.
below are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:
but at this point, the virus is here. it's silently spreading. and locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. as i was walking into the studio, terry, i saw the european union had put out a statement slamming the u.s. for taking this step without even informing them.
the two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by pfizer and moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. the need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.

gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. so what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?
oxfam thinks so. its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to u.n. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.

thompson: well, the problem is we have about 13 million people in this country who are here, in one form or another, illegally - visa overstays or what have you. but this notion that those individuals are terrorists, those individuals are murderers, robbers - very few of them. our experience and information lead us to believe that many of them are just hardworking people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. our system of immigration in this country needs fixing. and so what we're trying to say to the president is, you don't have to fan the flames of hysteria to fix an immigration system. you just need to do it. a wall won't fix an immigration system. common sense, listening to the professionals who say technology and some other things is the way to go is how you begin the process of fixing an immigration system. so...

al-omari: that's also quite vague at the moment. he's in charge of the file, but he has remained very silent about it. the day-to-day management is done by the president's peace envoy, mr. jason greenblatt. kushner remains as the overall figure. but we have not seen any direct engagement from him, so it remains a bit murky.
there is another way to look at trump's approach so far.
it's been roughly five years since piketty published capital in the twenty-first century. one of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.

if a wealth tax is such a good idea, why did europe kill theirs?
kuhn: that's right. but, you know, the relationship has changed a lot since president trump or trump back in the 1980s started railing against the imbalances in trade. you know, the japanese economy has stagnated for more than two decades. and it's been eclipsed by china as the second largest economy.
jennings: he has. i wonder if mitt romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to donald trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with rex tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. these two guys have a long and interesting history. i suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. but these senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.

on tuesday, the trump administration said that states should immediately make covid-19 vaccines available to everyone 65 and older as well as people with health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to covid-19. that's a change over previous recommendations to prioritize certain essential workers and people over 75 years old in the next phase of vaccination.
but to your question, i am a republican, but i'm not a republican - and i don't think we want republicans, just like we don't want democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a republican or democrat just to vote the party line.

in 1996, adelson imploded the sands and built the venetian, a complex with more than 8,000 rooms and more than 150 stores and restaurants. it's a model that he replicated in macau and singapore with enormous profit.
fuller clark: no. i think everybody is unified on the issue that we cannot allow trump a second term and that everybody is going to come together at the end of the primary with whoever the candidate is.
costello: yes, it does. and the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.

to all those who did not support us, biden said, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. if you still disagree, so be it. that's democracy. that's america. the right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion.
similar opinions have been voiced in florida, another republican-controlled state, since the orlando shooting. nightclubs like pulse, where 49 people were killed, are considered gun-free zones under current state law. at least one republican lawmaker has said since the shooting that he thinks gun-free zones should not be public policy in florida.

no other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, johnson says. it gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.
president trump has shed a spotlight on this idea. his 100-day plan mentioned redirect[ing] education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. however, some in the homeschooling movement oppose vouchers. the home school legal defense association has called them a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.

the interview began with a series of questions about the trump administration's policy toward iran. pompeo defended the president's maximum pressure campaign against tehran, saying it is absolutely working.
while the george w. bush and barack obama administrations rejected such a move, trump's administration embraced the policy.
the whole rally largely stuck to trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with north korean leader kim jong un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his state of the union address.
the two biggest u.s. car companies, general motors and ford, don't rely as much on exporting to china. instead, they build the majority of cars they sell in china in that country. the chinese market is important for both of them — gm sells more cars in china than it does in the u.s. but because most of those cars are built and sold in china, the sales are not subject to the tariffs.

behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.

on the last day of his visit to chile, francis set the simmering resentment some hold against the catholic church to a full boil with his defense of bishop juan barros. the bishop has been hotly criticized ever since the pope appointed him in 2015. barros was the protégé of rev. fernando karadima, a notorious disgraced priest who served in the southern city of osorno and who was found guilty and dismissed in 2011 for abusing dozens of minors over a decades-long period beginning in the 1980s.
scott jennings: good morning. thank you.
diamond: well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. but his critics would say that alex azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.

diamond: well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. we're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the centers for disease control. we don't have enough supplies, like respirators. our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. and i think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in italy, in spain, with their hospitals and icus totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.
trump awarded miriam adelson the presidential medal of freedom in 2018; the citation praised her work and philanthropy in combating addiction. you have been truly incredible, trump told her at the event, before looking out to the crowd. here to celebrate miriam's award is sheldon. where is sheldon? where is sheldon? where is he? there he is. oh, you didn't make the front row. he's probably angry.

pompeo has come under criticism — including, at times, from career diplomats in his own department — for failing to more forcefully defend yovanovitch in the face of political attacks. during testimony before impeachment investigators, for example, michael mckinley, a former senior adviser to pompeo, said he resigned from the department in part over what he interpreted to be a lack of public support for department employees.
president trump is a republican who hasn't had a particularly conservative foreign policy. he called the iraq war the single worst decision ever made. he's lauded russia, praised north korea and said he'll withdraw u.s. troops from afghanistan and syria. this week, he came back from hanoi with no deal with kim jong un. there's the prolonged humanitarian political crisis in venezuela and shifting - are they staying or going - policies of u.s. troops in syria and afghanistan. is this administration's foreign policy unraveling?

i think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [if] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.
methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. a phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. while doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.

donald trump: i think it's ridiculous. i think it's just another excuse. i don't believe it. i don't know why. and i think it's just, you know, they talk about all sorts of things. every week, it's another excuse. we had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the electoral college.
trump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.
ten years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.

diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.

when i was 12, i bought my first business, said adelson, who started out selling newspapers on the street. he told the story during a videotaped court deposition in 2008. you know, you hold the newspaper in your hand and say, 'hey, get your daily record.' we would yell that out. we would hawk newspapers, adelson said.

cohen: the uncertainty and the notion that is so cavalierly discussed. with the amount of nuclear weaponry in existence today, the life of this planet is at stake. so it's really incumbent on all of us to find ways to prevent something accidental from taking place because the consequences are existential for us.

metro offers plans with unlimited calling and texting. the price differences come down to the data packages available at 2gb, 10gb, or unlimited. plans start at $30 per month, which includes all taxes and extra fees.
the approval is a 10-year experiment, according to friday's announcement by seema verma, administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services. the approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. they think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.
biden did not shy away from any of those thorny issues. but you can bet that republicans will find plenty to disagree with democrats about in how to solve those issues. and what of unity then? more importantly, what of solving those issues when biden runs into the congressional buzz saw of republican opposition?
one of the top philosophical statements we make to recruits is you are guardians of the democracy. you're not just there to investigate crimes, but you're there to actually uphold the democracy, because our country depends on the rule of law, rahr told npr. and what happened at the capitol was completely against everything that the concept of the rule of law stands for.
after walking up to the white house, biden stood for a moment and looked out from the front portico. he then hugged his wife and held the embrace. they took it in, then turned and with their family walked into their home for the next four years.
but the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. as another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on capitol hill emerged with a deal monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's department of homeland security funding bill). this will fund about 55 miles of fencing.

gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with dan diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. he's been writing about how president trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.
that gives us time to see whether or not this social distancing ... is having the desired effect of slowing the spread of covid-19, he said.
machine-made snow is like one-week or two-week-old natural snow that's been sitting there and takes a while to go into a different grain size, and actually can become a better surface once it's tilled for the athletes, vanderkelen says.
mathai's lawyer, hector cortes, told the news station that her role in the chaos is really just attending a political rally for a president who she supports. a department spokesman, deputy johnny garcia, told npr that mathai already was on administrative leave from a previous incident involving an inappropriate relationship with an inmate in the jail. garcia declined to elaborate on either case since both are under investigation.
last summer, medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. the notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in marketplace and medicare coverage. officials also began contacting individuals who already have both medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.
diamond: as one official has said, terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? the trump administration and health officials knew back in january that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. they knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. but across the month of february, as my colleague david lim at politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. they were coming back with errors.

there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.
new york has confirmed more than 7,100 cases of the coronavirus that causes covid-19, making it by far the largest single source of the nearly 15,500 cases now reported in the u.s. as of friday, 38 people in the state had died from the respiratory disease. nationwide, the coronavirus is blamed for killing at least 205 people.

what usually happens with a controversial claim is that a politician might take something with a kernel of truth and spin it up. then it gets litigated in public and in the media, and if that elected official is found to be wrong, most adjust their language to fit within the bounds of acceptability. but trump could not be shamed.

the white house is also highlighting success stories. at the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit held in atlanta in march, obama appeared on stage with crystal oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from ohio. oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. she tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. i personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, oertle said in atlanta. i couldn't tough it out. i know some people can. i couldn't do it. this last time has been the most successful recovery for me.
u.s. manufacturers and policymakers have been arguing for years that china should lower its tariffs. president trump railed against the imbalance in trade tariffs in april, tweeting that they amount to stupid trade. the u.s. imposes a tariff of just 2.5 percent on vehicles imported from china.

it's baffling that the trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster, says goldfuss.
one reason is the limited availability of the treatment. but it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.

inskeep: you're exactly correct that mcconnell did not give in to it yesterday, but i do want to inquire about this and do it fairly. mitch mcconnell was described as one of the president's biggest enablers over the years. he did not always support the president. on a number of occasions, he criticized the president. but there were a lot of times that he was asked specifically about the president's lies, and he would just walk away from the microphones. should he have said more sooner?
when we talk about phone companies most of us automatically think of the big four here in the u.s.: at&t, sprint, t-mobile, and verizon. but they're not the only choices when it comes to who you get your service from and the popularity of alternative carriers (mvnos) is on the rise.

on the other hand, christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. these types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.

the recognition that preserving opportunities to live well requires preserving the integrity of the natural systems on which we rely is a critical first step. identifying the distinct forms of human impact and critical thresholds or planetary boundaries is an important further step that has been underway for some time. nine such boundaries have been identified, including safe rates of biodiversity loss, nitrogen removal from the atmosphere, phosphorus flowing into the oceans, consumption of freshwater, and land cover converted to cropland. from a policy perspective, what will be required is to define and allocate budgets with respect to each of these boundaries through regional and global agreements analogous to the paris climate accord.

those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.

jennings: well, i think it was perfectly fine for those claims to be adjudicated by courts and at the state level. and to say that there was no investigation, to say that it wasn't looked into was a lie. the president's campaign had every opportunity to avail themselves of the courts, and they did that. these things are decided in the courts and at the state level. and to go on the senate floor before and after the insurrection yesterday and to say, oh, we just want to have this looked into, that's a lie. they wanted to overturn the results of an election, and the results of elections are decided at the state level in this country.
the tariff reduction is seen as an olive branch to the trump administration. it comes as the two countries work to avoid a trade war after the tough-talk and tariff escalations last month.
diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
but many approve of the biden policy announced friday.
the other thing that was really interesting about his comments is they signal a big breach between the incoming administration and the intelligence community. he said in that interview on fox, he says i'm a very smart person. i don't need briefings every day. i don't need to hear the same things and the same words every day for eight years. and that alarms the national security establishment because what happens when they bring him intelligence about china or north korea or iran? is he going to just reject that if it doesn't fit in with his assumptions?

within the limits set by these boundaries and negotiated budgets, societies would then need to decide how best to preserve their members' opportunities to live well. a central argument of my book, living well, is that things will go better if the science of human well-being is taken seriously — and if policies focus on reinventing institutions to make them more efficient in providing what people actually need in order to live well, while functioning in ways that do not encourage or compel unnecessary consumption.

dan diamond: well, terry, i guess we can start with the good, such as it was. on wednesday night, nearly two months after the first u.s. case of novel coronavirus was detected, president trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. he's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. he has posted tweets, even on monday where he compared this to the flu. this is not the flu. the flu does not lead the national basketball association, the nba, to suspend its season.
tensions have since eased, but the episode has renewed questions about whether the president's maximum pressure campaign has emboldened tehran. since trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, iran has shot down a u.s. drone, targeted oil tankers in the strategic strait of hormuz, and been blamed for a debilitating attack on saudi oil facilities.
president donald trump: so i'm looking at two-state and one-state, and i like the one that both parties like.

i've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says michael botticelli, director of national drug control policy at the white house. we wouldn't do that with any other disease. if one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.
the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.

al-omari: i think what's happening is when you sit in that office, you realize that there are complexities, there are national interest concerns that you simply don't see from the outside. and i think his policy, whether to this conflict or to the middle east in general, has evolved as he saw the complexities and what is at stake for the united states in the region.

schmidt: each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration. and therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket. and the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket. so some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities. and, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration. but sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times. so that disrupts dockets.

what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.

some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. they point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.

diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.

cohen: well, you have to put it in the context of president obama and how he conducted himself throughout his eight years of the presidency. every instinct on his part was to find ways not to talk belligerently or to take action. in fact, ronald reagan talked tough as well, but people had a sense of how ronald reagan was going to govern. president trump comes in with no government experience in a - and accustomed to communicating in a manner which doesn't lend itself to accountability. so is this a way to conduct policy? i don't think so. but, you know, he's president and we're not.

that has been my work since day 1. from the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. you can think of what happened in flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. and we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. so what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support flint families — like child care, like medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. because what flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. and people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.

and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.

america is a nation of builders, trump said announcing the move at the white house, whose gleaming new infrastructure used to be the envy of the world. now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the u.s. like a third world country. it's really sad.
the president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in u.s. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. multiple polls also showed most americans blamed trump and republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.
if trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight saturday — though trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.
i think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. the president said that travel from europe would be suspended for 30 days. that wasn't completely correct. the white house had to immediately walk that back. u.s. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. the president said that cargo would be banned from europe. that would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the eu. but it turned out that trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.

in a previous life, i worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. they very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. that may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. it's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.

and i look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. but in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the u.s. just a step behind at every step of the way.
the block grant is just another example of putting politics ahead of health care during this pandemic, says johnson of the tennessee justice center. now is absolutely not the time to waste our energy and resources limiting who can access health care.

and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.

yet many people have missed the warnings.
liasson: well, it was pretty extraordinary. he rejected the consensus view of the intelligence community, that russia wasn't just interfering in the elections to sow chaos, actually trying to put its thumb on the scale in favor of trump. he put out an official statement - not a tweet - where he insulted the intelligence community, said these are the same people who brought us flawed intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction. he also suggested this morning that president obama might be trying to undercut his win, which, although it was decisive and even stunning, it was certainly not historic landslide, as trump just described it, because his 306 electoral votes rank him 46th out of 58 electoral college victories.

inskeep: six weeks later, in mid-december, joe biden's win was confirmed after every legal challenge failed. mcconnell then spoke again.
for a significant portion of the country, biden's speech began a disburdenment of the daily anxiety and unpredictability of the trump presidency. some republicans even praised his speech. for another large group of americans, though, they are now worried about the direction the country will take.
there is at least one u.s.-based car manufacturer that could win big from the reduction in chinese tariffs. tesla has been looking to break into the chinese market, but the 25 percent tariff has put its already-expensive electric vehicles out of reach for most chinese consumers. tesla sold nearly 15,000 cars in china last year, according to lmc.
that's a big shadow that an investment today casts, apt said. having a goal now that articulates out 30 years into the future is quite reasonable.

gross: well, let's take a look at robert redfield, who's the head of the centers for disease control. and he was a well-known aids researcher, and you say he was a favorite of christian conservatives when trump appointed him in 2018. he helped fight hiv-aids in africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. can you tell us more about that?

inskeep: so mitch mcconnell now becomes the minority leader, but i'm not even sure that's exactly the right term when it's a 50-50 senate and kamala harris, the vice president, is necessary to break ties. so he will still be in a very powerful position, but not dictating the schedule of the institution. do you think that he anticipates using his power to work with the new president, oppose the new president? what?

gross: among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?

for example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the u.s. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.

when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.

our policies have been dominated by the idea that a growing economy is what best enables everyone to find happiness in their own way, even as evidence has mounted that the damaging impact of human activities on planetary systems makes the explosive economic growth of recent decades unsustainable. the emergence of sustainability science, movement toward a post-carbon economy, and greater consideration of the environmental impacts of personal and institutional decisions are all signs that we are at least beginning to come to grips with the reality that we cannot persist in destabilizing the natural systems on which humanity relies without suffering severe and ultimately irreversible consequences.
both policies drew criticism from judges such as tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.
szybist with the nrdc said it would be problematic if gas-fired power replaced nuclear reactors that shut down. gas production and transportation can lead to methane leaks, and it produces carbon emissions when used to generate electricity, though not to the extent of coal-fired power.

in your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the trump administration is handling the epidemic. and just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in medicare and medicaid. and there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so medicare and medicaid missed a certain number of emails. they were out of the loop for a while. i mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. so what's the larger significance of stories like that?

al-omari: what we see right now is indications that we have a more realistic, more grounded policy, at least that's the indications. whether this will be turned into concrete policies, it's too early to tell. it's only been three months. but certainly the trajectory is very different from what we see - what we saw from trump as a candidate versus trump the president.
i think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the white house, and we would hire the best people from the democratic party, the smartest people from the republican party and the best people from the libertarian party, weld added.
cohen: well, because the notion of nuclear weapons has been what we call normalized - this is just another weapon.

adrian cronauer: if you've seen the film, you'll notice at the very beginning there was a very dull, dry, boring, soporific announcement about how to get your hold baggage if you'd lost your duffel bag or your trunk out of tan son nhut air base. that is as accurate depiction as is humanly possible of what the station sounded like when i got there. and one of my aims was just to make it sound more like a stateside station.

just a few months ago, the republican party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among black and latino voters, gained seats in congress and controlled more state legislatures. now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. the identity of the republican party is tied up with white supremacists.
he says he met with abbas and urged him to install a quota among the municipal representatives for young members. he says he has not heard back.
green says the lack of clarity may be due to the lack of seasoned policy makers in the trump transition team and the limited input from the state department.
the exchange with mary louise kelly, co-host of all things considered, follows the release by house democrats last week of messages suggesting that yovanovitch may have been under surveillance in the days before she was told to return to washington from her posting in kyiv last year.
while vaccine manufacturers are no doubt essential, placing their workers in the highest risk group and allowing their families to get the vaccine at the same time they do is problematic, says bioethicist ruth faden, the founding director of the berman institute for bioethics at johns hopkins university. she is also a member of the world health organization's strategic advisory group of experts' working group on covid-19 vaccines.
the army said you can ship to basic training after you complete the background checks. but now they've canceled all the background checks so nobody can ship to basic training, she said.

in another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.
gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.
democrats have fought back against block grant medicaid proposals since the reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the affordable care act. even some key republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.
he added, there is not one shred of proof against him. it's all calumny. is that clear?
the new president was sworn in wednesday and made an inaugural address aimed at unity. biden didn't sugarcoat, however, the hurdles to bringing americans together, and he leaned into the challenges the u.s. faces, as he sees it.
i am excited to join facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, austin said in a statement.
it's a bit of disbelief. it's been so long. and for so many people in flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied — that there was never going to be this level of accountability. and as a physician in flint, i never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. there [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. and as i began to practice more in flint and interact with the families in flint, i began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. and it's been open for about seven years. and having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.
the same is true of the gardiner, says amy graham. we have language in the gardiner scholarship law that says that by participating in the gardiner program you're not allowed to have fape. you're giving that up. the state will still evaluate students, but if families take them out of the system, they are no longer eligible for services.
the primary symptoms of covid-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. some people also experience fatigue, headaches and, less frequently, diarrhea. cases can range from mild to moderate to severe. about 80 percent of cases so far seem to be mild, according to the world health organization.

the two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. a third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest cnn/orc poll. the green party's jill stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.
shetamia taylor, a woman who was wounded in the dallas police attack last month, asked johnson about the black lives matter movement. and the libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.

president trump is pledging to repeal and replace the program with the help of congress. jennifer barfield doesn't know how she feels about that. it all depends on what obamacare is replaced with.
rubio's poor performance last saturday hurt him in new hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. he needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. but if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in south carolina. trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.
wine-banks: no, that came from the testimony at the senate. and we heard it the same way that all americans heard it, which was on television. alexander butterfield was an aide to richard nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. and a sort of happenstance question by one of the senate staffers on a friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until monday, when it was publicly revealed in senate hearings.
it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, says cooper. the bottom line is that abstinence is the best and only proven way to keep yourself from getting a sexually transmitted infection or from getting pregnant. and so whether you're straight or trans or bi, the message is the same.
beyoncé and jay-z present a unified front on 'everything is love'
number two, with respect to my actions when i was a junior senator, you will recall that i never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. i never said that a nominee should not get a vote. and what i also said at the time was that i was concerned about some of judge alito's views that i considered more troubling. but in the case of merrick garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.
and the fact, look - i'm not a muscle-bound guy. i don't strike fear in the hearts of everybody, you know - when i have to, i try to unleash some sort of inner charm monster in order to get out of any uncomfortable circumstance.
farsad: eventually he'll read the entire constitution, and then we'll really be screwed.
but he testified from memory for days, and his memory was really incredibly accurate, as he testified about hush money payments and about perjury and the white house suborning perjury and about the approval of the break-in to begin with, which was done by members of the white house staff and the committee to reelect the president. so it was quite remarkable testimony.
demby: so one of the things that leaders all over the country are wrestling with is - you know, the president of the united states has used some very divisive rhetoric, right? and i'm curious as to how that's played out in birmingham. has that sort of animated and agitated a lot of these deep-seated inequities that you're talking about, this centers of power not being evenly distributed?
gross: tom hanks, welcome back to fresh air.
after boylan came out as trans in her 40s, she felt estranged from her previous life. she describes her new book as a memoir of masculinity, kind of told the way an expatriate might speak of the country of their birth.
meraji: and back at npr, our thanks to anya grundmann, neal carruth, steve drummond and the npr events team, which includes jessica goldstein, allie prescott, elle mannion (ph) and our illustrator, la johnson. and a shoutout to the rest of the code switch fam - karen grigsby bates, kat chow, adrian florido, maria paz gutierrez, walter ray watson, sami yenigun and our editor, leah donnella.
except for sen. lee, trump's list is drawn from other courts around the country, both state and federal. friday's additional 10 include:
demby: something like 44 percent of the new marriages in honolulu, hawaii, are between people of different races.
hanks: i was trying to come up with what was the blandest, most odd...
rockwell: (as bob fosse) you're going to hate it.
when she lost her job, she also lost her insurance. so, on the last day in january, jennifer barfield signed up for health insurance — through obamacare.
tucker: it's very impressive the way the music here shifts easily between hip-hop rapping and r&b vocalizing, between beyonce's deep-voice croon and jay-z's high-pitched exclamations. on lovehappy, the duo swaps lines back and forth, the lyrics playfully pointed. the first words of the song are happily in love, and they seem to have reached a point in their relationship where they can joke - very ruefully - about jay-z's infidelity.
palindromic dates have long been viewed as carrying special significance and even spirituality. adding to the universal appeal and rarity of sunday's date is its achieving the eight-digit palindrome pinnacle, working in the cross-cultural formats of mm-dd-yyyy and dd-mm-yyyy.
the fight began last spring, when some parents agitated to update the district's current sex ed program with something that they hoped would be more science-based and inclusive of lgbtq+ people. (lgbtq+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, with the + denoting a broader inclusion of sexual and gender minorities.)
meraji: ...we will be playing this back to you...
and listening to the tapes that aren't relevant to the criminal prosecution, you can hear a lot of conversations between them that show their close personal relationship. her brother, by the way, was the sheriff of cook county. and he - joe woods - exchanged suits with richard nixon, and she exchanged clothes with pat nixon. she was known as aunt rose by both of the nixon girls, tricia and julie. and she was really a part of the family.
a spokesman for buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending.
and when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the senate saying, i won't meet with a nominee; i won't provide a nominee a hearing; i will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. that matters to people.
he's doing everything i sent him to washington to do, everything. ... when the press gets upset with him, i know he's had a good day.
fx's new drama tells the story of the complex partnership between choreographer bob fosse and dancer gwen verdon. married, then divorced, their lives remained connected professionally for decades.
sagal: all right. your first quote is from naturally, inevitably, the president of the united states.
this week, franklin graham, son of the late rev. billy graham, questioned buttigieg's claim to christianity in a series of tweets, saying in part, as a christian i believe the bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.
as democratic presidential hopefuls work to position themselves as the candidate to unify the country and win over supporters of president trump, an influential iowa evangelical leader is inviting them to a forum on religion and politics traditionally reserved for republicans ahead of iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.
how did you make the transition from that kind of role to playing these, you know, kind of, like, courageous men, like the men we've been talking about, courageous men who might have been scared inside, but they rose to the occasion?
there are times when i struggle to remember what it was like to live in that world, but then i remember the dogs, and it becomes really clear, she says. there was the dog that i had when i was a boy. there was a dog for when i was a teenager. and there's one for when i was a cool college boy, and there was one for when i was a husband, and a boyfriend, and a father.
liotta: (as himself) no, no, no, no. i don't want you to leave empty-handed. come on in for a selfie.
it's being investigated, it's being looked at very, very strongly, trump said, after cbs's lesley stahl asked whether the saudis had murdered khashoggi. and we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. as of this moment, they deny it and they deny it vehemently. could it be them? yes.
jones: viewing a kkk uniform at the civil rights institute. all you can really tell at first is that it was starched. some betty sue, marge, jane, some proper girl with a great black iron made those corners sharp. the hood, white and ablaze with creases, body flat and open for husband, brother, son. behind the glass it seems frozen, waiting for summer night to melt it into action, for the clean white flame of god to awaken its limbs. in front of it you are dwarfed. you imagine a pair of pupils behind the empty holes of the mask. behind the stiff cotton, would the eyes squint to see through small white slits, or would they open wide as a burning house to hunt you down until you pooled like old rope before them?
davies: this is fresh air. let's get back to the interview terry gross recorded with actor ray liotta. it's part of our end-of-summer series of favorite recent interviews.
many factors are contributing to this delay: people are staying in school longer, delaying marriage and having children later. this generation is just starting to buy homes, and kushi expects to see a wave of young buyers in coming years.
the kids write things like, is gender a social construct? and, for any of our facilitators with dysphoria, how does that affect your sex life? and, how does being sexually active affect you emotionally?
sanchez: (as raul mendez) the girlfriend never gave him up - tough girl. don't worry, i'll find him.
sanders: because, audie, we're friends. you probably already kind of know this. my love life is like the end of a michael bay movie. a lot of explosions...
jones: so i don't feel that my work with history is separate at all from my work as a poet or really just as a human being. i think that we all carry histories with us. there are so many histories that have made me possible. so i can't be from alabama and not know and tell that story of george wallace. i can't be a black woman and not tell the story of sally hemings. it's always with me all the time, and it makes me who i am. and as a poet, that's my job, to tell the story of humans. and so i have to, of course, have history in there all the time.
davies: jill wine-banks is a legal analyst for nbc. her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the watergate scandal is called watergate girl. we'll talk more after a short break. this is fresh air.
gross: i remember. i'm telling you now (laughter)...

wine-banks: rose mary woods was eventually called his executive assistant. at the time, she was his secretary. but she had been with him from the time he was elected to the senate. she had met him when he was in the house of representatives and had been very impressed with how he turned in his reimbursement forms. he thought - she thought he was extremely neat and accurate. and he was impressed with her as well and was one of the first people he hired when he became a senator and one of the first people he brought into the white house after he was elected. and she was much more than an assistant to him. she really was an adviser.
gross: swell. so goodfellas, of course - a 1990 film. you played henry hill. and it's based on the nicholas pileggi novel, wiseguy, in which henry hill tells his whole story, starting from when he's a kid. and he aspires to be like the small-time gangsters in the neighborhood. he ends up being their assistant and ends up being, you know, really, like, a part of that whole ring and ends up in the witness protection program. i know that you listened to tapes of henry hill.
liotta: (as henry hill) really funny - you're really funny.
volz: well, first of all, so harvey was not a customer. he had sworn off drugs. but his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. so that was how that connection happened. but he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. he was very personable and very connected to the community. and so my mom knew him.
vanderplaats also has been, at times, a critic of trump's character and rhetoric — though he has largely supported trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion.
(soundbite of charlie mole's importance of being earnest front titles)
trump's list includes none of the conservative lawyers who practice regularly before the supreme court, nor does it include any of the highly regarded conservative judges who sit on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, the court that the late justice antonin scalia served on, and on which obama nominee garland now serves as chief judge.
wine-banks: she kept all of his personal belongings exactly as they were, including an ashtray with a half-smoked cigar.
davies: and let's just explain for people who aren't watergate buffs. remind us who john dean was - yeah.
meyer figured once he took office, trump would be more presidential than he had been.
klein: i don't. i definitely want you to do it.
gross: yeah, so what year was this?
demby: y'all are like thousands of thousands miles off. it's actually honolulu.
to disguise their protest plans, the students publicized the event as a marriage proposal.
and for actresses, scarlett johansson was nominated twice, once for supporting for jojo rabbit and again for lead in marriage story. she'll be competing against cynthia erivo for harriet, saoirse ronan in little women, charlize theron in bombshell and renee zellweger for her turn as judy garland. here is a clip from that movie, judy.
for many readers, comparing an elected american president to a russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. but if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets.
tucker: the music on everything is love relies on a constant contrast between instrumental lushness and verbal starkness. this is mass-market hip-hop designed to reach the widest possible audience. and i mean that as a compliment. it's a big, complex goal, one that very few music stars even try to attempt anymore.
besides his major postings, kuhn's journalistic horizons have been expanded by various short-term assignments. these produced stories including wartime black humor in iraq, musical diplomacy by the new york philharmonic in pyongyang, north korea, a kerfuffle over the plumbing in jerusalem's church of the holy sepulchre, pakistani artists' struggle with religious extremism in lahore, and the syrian civil war's spillover into neighboring lebanon.
davies: we're speaking with alia volz. her new memoir is called home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. we will talk more after a short break. also, maureen corrigan reviews the compelling memoir of a vietnamese refugee who fled the fall of saigon with his family and grew up in a pennsylvania town. i'm dave davies, and this is fresh air.
i would explain to them how gender identity is your internal sense of what it is to be male or female. and then, for some people, their gender identity sometimes doesn't align with their biological sex, harp says. and kids — when they asked those questions — they were like, 'oh!' like it made sense to them.
jones: i've heard that before, and that doesn't make sense to me because we have to remember what happened and what is happening in order for it not to happen anymore. and i'm a teacher, too, so of course i want us to learn and relearn and relearn forever. we can't leave history as history. it's part of the present as well.
meraji: and special thanks to our volunteers tonight. we couldn't have done this without you.
sam rockwell: (as bob fosse) i saw a cut in the movie.
volz: she remembers one day in december of 1981 walking down castro street, making her deliveries. and in the window of star pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. and it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be kaposi's sarcoma. and my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. i saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. it just was a little thing. and then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.
my mom, upon receiving this information, after only dating the guy for three weeks, was a little taken aback. she wasn't looking to have a child. so there became a little push-pull between them for a while around the idea of this spirit child, which is, obviously, kind of a crazy thing to write about years after the fact, but i wanted to be true to my parents' visions of what was going on in their lives.
i'm tired of being called a child molester, because i'm not. i've never met a transgender person who is or have been. and i know that if i was in a bathroom and some pervert came in, he would be sorry about it, said gerri cannon, a transgender woman who met with lawmakers every day to keep the bill moving forward.
seattle mayor ed murray is being sued by a man who claims murray raped and molested him three decades ago, when the man was 15 years old.
grove: a jar of margarine? i have no idea.
volz: it did. and i think that by the time i was maybe old enough to really question those ideas myself, the role of marijuana had changed so much culturally that i had a whole different answer.
why a day like sunday hasn't been seen in 900 years
liotta: i'm a big believer that the script is your bible. and the script - and a good one - tells you everything that you need to know. and i just committed to the script. i learned everything. i learned - i had so much time to learn it. and i was home in new jersey 'cause my mother was sick at the time. and marty was just getting ready to launch last temptation of christ. and so the movie was pushed so i had more time.
parker: yeah, you got to keep the students healthy and happy.

betsy sewell: i made this pot in high school. i was just having fun, and it was appraised for a lot of money.
democratic candidates oftentimes talk about jefferson, and madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about matthew, mark, luke, and john, hale said, referring to the first four books of the christian new testament. a democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.
drace: i am a truck driver. i am a disc golf player. and i'm a father of four cats with my wife.
what i would say is that i had a bad marriage to a good man. right? i had a kind of marriage where i was not happy, and there was a lot going on that was less than freeing and less than true. but because he was a good man ... i had the kind of marriage that women are trained to be grateful for. ... i think, over and over again, there's sort of a gaslighting of women. it's everywhere. it's every time we admit that we want more, we're told we should just be grateful for what you have. it's the first story i ever learned about women, like the story of eve: if you want more and you go for it, you will destroy yourself and the world.

i'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates — not just for supreme court, but for appellate court judges.
meraji: and on our show - on code switch - we talk a lot about racial inequities in public education as well as the justice system. and i was just wondering - in those roles that you had before mayor, could you, in your own way, address those inequities?
donna: (laughs) i remember when we were at a military ball, and we were dancing. and the music had been fast, and then we went into a slow dance. and he was in ... his dress blues. and i remember how he would hold me. isn't it weird, i still remember what his lips feel like on my neck?
alqunun's story didn't end in that hotel room. with the help of the united nations high commissioner for refugees, which facilitated her application for asylum, alqunun is now in a safe place, she said.
klein: yeah, do it before you get to that third mic.
the latter is the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. there is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'i can say what i want when i want to.'
meraji: mayor woodfin, there's a lot of nodding happening right here.
hanks: i enjoyed the confidence of actually, penny marshall. i had made two movies with her. the first one was big, which, you know, (laughter)...
klein: you do have a lot of red flags just up and down.
nina totenberg: mr. president, judge garland was runner-up twice before. so why now and not twice before?
hanks: (as alan clay) yeah, don't you know they can only kill me with a golden bullet. golden bullet, you know? you get it? it's lawrence of arabia.
liotta: yeah, my mouth was open really wide, laughing...
but at the moment, there's no target date for getting married either.
davies: now, this photo, ironically taken by white house photographers, kind of made rose mary woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. it just seems kind of ridiculous. did you have sympathy for her?
... we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.
a 'home baked' childhood: when the family business is marijuana brownies
we were not traumatized by the reality of them getting the divorce. we were just confused by the geography of it all because my mom could not afford to have four kids. my younger brother was born. she could take care of the baby. and my dad - he - at that time, he had to go off to reno and establish residency for six weeks. but - and he had a job, so he could afford to take the three of us. and so off we went, and we ended up living with a lady, and she had kids. and they ended up getting married, and they were married for a couple of years.
(rapping) pull up, hop out, wreck. got no time, but we got pateks. i come around stepping around on necks. my chica got nicas (ph) upset. why? oh, why these - so mad for? they don't want yonce on their door, louis slugger to your 4-door. careful, you get what you asked for. we go to cuba, then aruba...
angela kelly, the group's director, spoke against the bill before the panel's vote on monday.
and as they planned all this and used unaccounted campaign money, which led to legislation that's been undone by citizens united, the supreme court case, they had so much money that they could spend it. and it's just very disturbing because i was raised to respect the president and the presidency, even if it wasn't someone that i agreed with politically. and so that was a - what i now see as a childhood vision that was just destroyed listening to the president committing crimes.
liotta: it was crazy. see, now, i've said that before. and i've done that on talk shows. and you're the only person who i've ever talked to who remembers the freddie.
liotta: i did. you know, i told that story...
one of the first battles was in new hampshire in 2009 and started out as, a really very simple extension of nondiscrimination protection to a class that isn't covered and needs to be covered, said state rep. ed butler, a democrat.
unidentified actor: (as character) oh, my god. are you ok?
philpott: it might be a political marriage of convenience. back when jeb bush was running in the republican presidential primary, he was candidate trump's whipping boy.
kuhn previously served two five-year stints in beijing, china, for npr, during which he covered major stories such as the beijing olympics, geopolitical jousting in the south china sea, and the lives of tibetans, uighurs, and other minorities in china's borderlands.
he may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation, gessen writes, a climate of more anxiety and fear of change. gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar hannah arendt, author of the origins of totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.
meraji: that totally touches on what i was thinking.
that passage appeared to refer to comments by trump about the plight of christians in the middle east, and to remarks by rudy giuliani, who told fox news that trump had wanted to impose a muslim ban but wanted advisers to find a way to do it legally. immigrants rights advocates said giuliani's words could offer them evidence to prove the administration had a discriminatory purpose.
2. geography and the state's three regions matter

the diversity visa lottery program goes back to the 1980s when its earliest version was created largely to benefit irish immigrants. in the 1990s congress changed the program so that anyone from a country that doesn't already send many immigrants here can apply.
it seems like there's like a debt spiral or something. when you get into a little bit of it, it just feeds back in on itself, and for us that started with student loans — that was our first debt, he says.
gross: how did that become the title for the record company?
the commission's report on the religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination debate, published last september, came down squarely on the anti-discrimination side. the commission recommended that civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination were of preeminent importance and that religious exemptions to such policies must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis.
three days later, public protest was so dramatic, our office and the white house were inundated with bags of mail. this is in the era before email. there were telexes, but other than telexes, there was actual postal mail that we received and the white house received that led nixon to do a u-turn and say, ok, i'll hire a new special prosecutor. and i'll give you the tapes.
that was in parallel to the reality that a couple of teachers that i had, and also an awful lot of the adults, is that they talked about the war in a - literally - a three-act structure. and they described their lives, they told stories about their youths that were divided up into act one, before the war. well, you know, before the war, i lived in los angeles. and before the war, my dad was a farmer. and before the war, i was enrolled at mills college.
while the u.s. was marking the palindrome of 11-02-2011, in the u.k., it was 02-11-2011, or just another wednesday.
the rules of improv, i believe, are so profound because they apply to almost any kind of collaboration. ... no. 1: say yes. two: it's all about the group. and three: don't think.
there's this whole myth of, 'oh, if you're a lesbian, honestly, just, like, go for it 'cause you can't get pregnant lol!'  jokes wilson. but it's not true — there's, like, risks and stuff that go into that, and i know that from going here. and like, lesbians wear condoms when they're having sex. people should know that. lesbians should know that!
cummings: (as rick halloway) i disagree.
douban: right? so, you know, i've talked to a lot of people about this - a lot of interracial couples, and there's a lot going on. long story short, it is not all that common, although it kind of depends on where you are. so if you are in the city birmingham, if you are on the campus of uab, not that big a deal, not that uncommon. but if you're in maybe coleman county or someplace like that...
totenberg: no. they're both constitutional decisions.
wine-banks: i think it was. and it's easier to say that as a nonpolitician, but i don't think that leaving a president who does the things that president trump has done unaccountable is acceptable. and yes, his acquittal means that he is now with no guardrails and may do even worse things in the next few months before the election. and if he happens to be reelected, his second term will be even more horrible in terms of violations of the law. so i think it was the right thing to do. i don't think it leaves him any stronger. over 80% of the country believes that there should have been witnesses, that there should have been documents, that this was a sham trial. and i think that what we're going to find is that americans are going to hold their senators responsible for cutting this off. to me, one of the most painful things was listening to the not guilties after senators had said, well, yes, he's guilty, he's done these things. yes, the evidence is overwhelming. they weren't just saying unimpeachable. they had to say the words not guilty, and that was just not correct.
volz: he takes, not dilantin, but another medication. i think it's tegretol. and he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.
women in saudi arabia are treated like children, even if they are 50 or 60 years old. they treat women terribly. they aren't free or equal to their male counterparts, alqunun said. i hope my story prompts a change to the law especially as it has been exposed to the world. this might be the agent for change.
siegel: now, during the campaign, trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the supreme court - 21 names i believe. what - who are they?
sagal: experts have more expertise than nonexperts, according to experts. but this week, we read about an expert getting something wrong. our panelists are going to tell you about it. pick the one who's telling the truth. you will win our prize, carl kasell expertly leaving his voice on your voicemail are you ready to play?
i was very used to a lacto-vegetarian hindu brahmin diet, and so i found it hard to eat american foods. so we would have to seek out restaurants that had rice — whether it was a chinese restaurant or a mexican restaurant, or whatever. and luckily we lived in new york city, and i experienced the city through my palate, and it was an exciting place to grow up as a child. it gave me great independence, but it also allowed me to really experience a lot of the world in a much less sheltered way than i would if i was living anywhere else.
3. debates could sway the race
sagal: now what do you do there in hickory?
from my earliest childhood memories i can remember being in the kitchen, and my grandmother and my aunts and my older cousins, and my mother, certainly, all taught me about food. i only found out recently from a scientist in seattle at the science museum that i am a supertaster, and i never knew that was actually a thing ... i bring it up because from a very early age, i was always very curious about eating foods that normally toddlers don't eat. very sour things like mango and tamarind, very bitter things like fermented foods or certain asian vegetables. and you know, you don't really give a bowl of fiery indian pickles to a 2-year-old! and yet i was climbing up on my grandmother's shelves in the kitchen like a monkey, sort of like a temple monkey, to try and get at the pickle jars ... i think my young palate needed that stimulation.
brennan: ...i'm going to go with a.
after those protests, the family leader said in a tweet, shouting protests, namecalling are not how christians are called to engage with our culture.
in 2009, he proposed the state expand its anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression to address transgender citizens' concerns about housing, employment, even physical safety.
one thing i, i do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the constitution might be ambiguous. what do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? you know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.
davies: in october of 1973. as it happens, you were away on a wedding then, so you weren't in the office. but you did go back. and i want to just focus on that few days when, you know, two people - ranking people had been fired. the president was determined to shut down this investigation. you had an office with files and statements and all kinds of evidence. and you didn't know what was going to happen. were you - what kinds of conversations did you have among each other, and what did you do to protect yourselves?
but at age 31, mchale isn't living that dream. instead, he and his wife rent in danbury, conn., an hour's drive from the elementary school where he teaches, across the state line in new york.

sagal: oh, congratulations. well, landon, welcome to our show. let me introduce you to our panel this week. first up, it's a comedian performing this upcoming week - may 15 to the 21 - at the brad garrett comedy club at the mgm las vegas. it's alonzo bodden.
the first dog we had was this mulish, snarling, resentful dalmatian who was named — and i can't believe we named the dog this — playboy. ... playboy would steal the thanksgiving turkey off the table and chase after motorcycles and bite your friends. so, it was a difficult relationship. however, the one person in the world who loved playboy without reservation — and the feeling was mutual — was my father. ... he would just get down on the floor and ask that question that has haunted me my entire life: who's a good boy? who's a good boy? and i remember being very jealous in some ways of that dog, because my father could love this horrible dog without condition, whereas for me, it was harder, because i didn't know who was a good boy, but i knew it wasn't me.
not owning a home makes him feel he has made a mistake that has kept him short of a key milestone — and his piece of the american dream. mchale says he feels trapped by his and his wife's combined $1,200 monthly student loan bills, which prevent them from saving enough for a down payment.
in fosse/verdon, these two inhabit their roles completely and convincingly. the story isn't rolled out sequentially. it starts with the filming of sweet charity and keeps hopping backwards and forwards, revealing bits of their past a scene at a time. so i'm not doing any spoiling here by presenting a scene from when after the couple is separated but still seeking support and advice from each other. he visits her after a day working on the movie cabaret, and she welcomes him warmly at first, but not for long. any worries about this drama taking it too easy on the characters are instantly alleviated.
every time he tweets something, i just shake my head and say, 'oh god, please don't tweet anymore.' maybe they should take and dismantle his tweet account, meyer said.
ashley m. jones: i think in an interview once i said, well, we'll hose you down with the water where somebody else will just poison you with it. and, i mean, that's basically what it is.

when massachusetts (and other jurisdictions) redefined marriage to include same-sex couples, making it illegal to deny adoption to them., the catholic agencies closed down their adoption services and argued that their religious freedom had been infringed.
hanks: well, no, i've been doing it for the last five years, but with varying levels of concentration.
douban: ...probably not going to find very many interracial couples.
brown-james: and then when you're together, you have all of that arousal built up so you can do what you want to do and you can be just a regular couple and hang out. like, we've done all the sexy things. we're tired. let's just eat pizza and watch netflix and hang out.

jack gentile: everyone has spent last year trying to get more comfortable being alone or being by themselves. and so now that the vaccine is starting to come out, we're sort of going back to normal. so how do you start to feel comfortable being with other people?
wine-banks: it does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the supreme court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. there's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. and it's very important if the american people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. i'm very fact-based. and i can see information. people can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. and if the facts are withheld, you have nothing.

meraji: this is recorded. so if you're still mayor 20 years from now...

grove: it's in western maryland. it's a little small town. and we just got a second gas station, so we are rapidly...
gross: and you've just come back to town, you're talking to your ex-brother-in-law about your failed marriage to this guy's sister. and you speak first.
meraji: we do get in people's business, and it's really fun.
gross: ...your particular form of interrogation (laughter). so are you often cast as cops and criminals because of goodfellas and because of something wild before that? like, did that get you started in a certain trajectory?
this moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — i think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.
davies: now, i paid a lot of attention to this. and i remembered that as being what he actually said - yes, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. when you actually got the tape, it didn't say that, did it?
gessen's perceptions about russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). but by the same token, average americans might well ask how much gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most americans.
he declined to take questions, saying this is now a matter for the courts to resolve.
sagal: another difference - you do not have to write a brilliant novel to get on our show, just give us a call. the number is 1-888-waitwait. that's 1-888-924-8924. now, let's welcome our first listener contestant. hi, you are on wait wait... don't tell me.
douban: for the wu-tang clan fans among us.
you can listen to the original interviews here:
ken tucker, byline: you can listen to everything is love as the completion of a trilogy. in 2016, beyonce released her album, lemonade, which, among many other things, discussed an extramarital affair committed by a husband commonly thought to be her own. then in 2017, jay-z released his album, 4:44, in which, among many other things, he agonized and apologized for being unfaithful. now we get an album from the carters, jay-z and beyonce presenting themselves as a united front. husband and wife, committed partners and musicians.
latifa bint mohammed al maktoum: they put me in prison and they tortured me. basically, one guy was holding me while the other guy was beating me. and they did that repeatedly.
i thought fudan was relatively free. but oftentimes, what the students are told has already been censored from above, says the fudan student protester.
this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross, who has a cold today. my guest, jill wine-banks, is a familiar face to cable tv audiences. she's appeared frequently as a legal analyst for msnbc, often commenting on the mueller investigation or the impeachment and trial of president trump. but turn back the clock a few decades and you'd find her on the inside of another historic investigation into presidential misconduct. as an assistant special prosecutor in the watergate investigation, she confronted associates of president nixon in court and extracted evidence from white house records and presidential tape recordings.
cao zhenhua has experienced the restraints firsthand. in 2018, he was fired as a lecturer at guizhou minzu university after being accused of questioning the current relevance of marxism in a seminar.
(soundbite of brothers osborne song, 21 summer)
meraji: when you run into something that you feel like might be what lisa calls a microaggression, you ask a clarifying question to figure out, all right, was that really a microaggression or was it an honest question...
the bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. the real argument is the one that you made, nina, which is that they don't want a democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a democrat to fill the seat.
on this, and other matters, she's willing to give president trump the benefit of the doubt.
saudi women have been fighting to end guardianship laws for a long time, egyptian-american activist mona eltahaway said on twitter. women's rights activists have been jailed and tortured for fighting to end guardianship. remember them. demand their release.
liotta: (as matt wozniak) no more mayhem, raul.
after it actually happened, the discussion was, first of all, were we fired or was only archibald cox fired? and it appears that the office had been abolished, but we weren't actually fired. and so the discussion was, shall we quit in protest? and we basically decided, and archibald cox advised us, do not quit. that would give the president exactly what he wants. you know this case. you should never leave it unless you are forced out. as long as you can do your job, do it.
i was procrastinating. i had the movie in my head, but i wasn't writing it. but i noticed this trend in my life, which was that i was showing up to lunch meetings or business meetings, but i wasn't showing up to meet myself. so i wrote a note next to my bed — this is so corny, but i wrote, mike! you have an appointment at café pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind! it's so corny, and i would show up! i never didn't show up, and i wrote this movie [in] spurts of essentially three hours, like i'd write from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., and the reason why i would do that is because i was essentially barely awake. because i feel like that moment, at 7 to 10 a.m., you're not afraid of the world yet.
alonzo bodden: neal, have you ever had an audience confused? like, why you keep doing this sad stuff? can't you stay funny?

ginsburg and breyer are among the court's liberals. the third, justice kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. but he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. and he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. so if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.
hanks: well, you have your average sandstorm. that's a fascinating thing.
brennan: so - but it's - but how he died is hilarious.
i think it's not just the difference to male and female, it's the difference between being young and being middle aged. so maybe i'm the wrong person to observe those changes, but i try to live my life with courage as best i can. i'll be honest and say that tears live very close to the surface now when they didn't used to. maybe it's estrogen. maybe it's simply being older. ... you live long enough, you end up with a lot of arrows in your side. whatever the reason, it doesn't take much to get me weeping, and quite often weeping just because something wonderful has happened. so my emotions are definitely closer to the surface, but then everything is closer to the surface — and not only because of hormones, but because i'm living in the world with no secrets.
but most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. and they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.
and the whole business changed from when i first started. there were a lot of people that were getting movies that were coming out of television. you know, i started out really hot out of the box. then i've definitely had and up-and-down career. and when things started cooling off again, it frustrated me. so i was just watching what was going on. and that seemed to be the way things started to be going.
ward says she and her girlfriend have had to postpone not just buying a house; her girlfriend is also putting off her graduate education.
if the seminaries refuse to abide by the church's more stringent positions, they could conceivably lose some of their church funding. on the other hand, if they go along with those positions and alienate prospective students, they could also suffer.
davies: this is fresh air. let's get back to the interview terry gross recorded with actor ray liotta. it's part of our end-of-summer series of favorite recent interviews.
aziz inan is professor of electrical engineering at the university of portland and a palindrome aficionado. tracing back and looking ahead over centuries, he mines palindromes like gems and says the last time we had an eight-digit palindrome date was 908 years ago on 11-11-1111.
actress pamela adlon says 'better things' is dedicated to her daughters: adlon's new fx series is based on her own experience raising three girls as a single mom. her daughters are very much a part of the show, she says.
half an hour away, though, people are having these kinds of conversations.
menkin: (as brad) kind of weird being relyand and being out here.
npr spoke with other lgbtq+ students who agree with robinson. most wanted to remain anonymous because they aren't out to their parents, but they described willing to wait as having religious undertones and being shame-based. one student said it left her feeling dirty. another said, the only thing we learned about gay sex was it gives you stds and you shouldn't do it.

pat mccrory: we believe a court, rather than a federal agency, should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires.
grosz: all the couples who tried it didn't even get past the first step and found it a little light on the lotus and a little heavy on the screaming.
you get points just for showing up, vander plaats said. and so i think our audience would embrace them.
the problem was all he did was eat potato chips. and if you've ever listened to anybody eat potato chips for, like, hours as he's talking, it's an extremely annoying thing (laughter). and the biggest thing that i learned from it was just how casual they were - how casual henry was about what happened. it was just like he was telling a story of what his kids were doing and how they played in a park, except they were talking about, you know, people getting killed or beaten. it was very, very casual, though.
drace: let's go with the nuclear meltdown.

at that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. and that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.
and nixon says, yeah, we could get a million dollars. and the version that we first heard of this came from one of the president's, you know, inner circle, bob haldeman, at the senate hearings in which he said, yeah, the president said, yes, we could get a million dollars, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong.

sound choices coalition, a nonprofit organization working to end polygamy, is leading a campaign to defeat the bill.
brennan: well, no, i had to - it was between emotional mics or just doing - becoming a mime.
gross: so your voice is very important in this 'cause you're not only portraying the character on screen, but you're doing voiceover throughout the film. so let me play the opening voiceover of the film in which - this is a flashback where your character is young. but you're doing the voiceover as an adult looking back on your childhood.
klein: you tweeted recently that women are more interested in you since your special. and i wanted to know - how is that manifesting? like, are women coming up to you and just saying, like, oh, my god, you are so hot when you talk about your lifelong struggle with depression?
democrats head to nevada first, feb. 20th, but they are already trying to appeal to the largest block of voters in the state — african americans. that was apparent at the democrats' debate thursday night. hillary clinton hopes to rebound from a drubbing in new hampshire at the hands of bernie sanders.
and i feel badly that the president let her believe that she did it, that the white house blamed her. they withdrew. she was represented initially by white house counsel. they withdrew that and made her hire a private attorney and - which is probably the right thing because if they actually were blaming her, ethically, they shouldn't represent her.
well, it's a typical actor's story. i'm in line now to be a drama major because i think that's the easiest way to get by this year. and there was a really pretty girl. and she said, you auditioning for the play tonight? i said, no. and she just berated me. oh, my gosh, how could you not want to do the play? you got to do the play. it's all about doing plays. what kind of actor doesn't want to do a play? so i went, and i auditioned for the play. and it was for cabaret.

and he says renting means he isn't free to plan his life, even as their first child — a boy — is on the way. one example: decorating the baby's nursery. we can't really make any actual changes. we can't really paint too much, mchale says.
the other one is, i think, something that is real to all of us, the shark terror of a loss of confidence in ourselves. no matter who we are, no matter what we've done, there comes a point where you think how did i get here and am i going to be able to continue this? when are they going to discover that i am, in fact, a fraud and take everything away from me? it's a high-wire act that we all walk. and i do this in the work that i do because there are days when i know that 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, i am going to have to deliver some degree of emotional goods. and if i can't do it, that means i'm going to have to fake it. and if i fake it, that means they may catch me at faking it. and if they catch me at faking it, well, then it's just doomsday.
meraji: ...because they really want you to sign an executive order to basically put in writing that you won't use your city's resources for immigration enforcement, that you won't use your city's resources to surveil muslim residents. can you respond to that criticism?
he would think there's people listening in on our conversations, sherri says. he would whisper to me in the car, 'shhh the car is bugged!' no, the car's not bugged. he wouldn't talk on the phone.

some of china's most prestigious universities, including beijing's peking university and renmin university, have new charters. and nanjing university, which amended its charter in december, has a prominent international studies program jointly administered with johns hopkins university.
sagal: but on thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the russia investigation. the white house dismissed that though because it came from a completely unreliable source - president donald trump.
among the questions: when does an invitation or a cake qualify as free speech?
hanks: ...kind of like merchandising-hit-thing, and there used to be a record player that you could buy for kids, and every kid wanted. it was called a close-and-play record. you would just put a record on the turntable, you would close the lid and somehow, magically, the needle would land in the groove. and so i took that and turned it into playtone. but i never thought anything of it until i saw what the graphic artist did with the name. when you make a movie as a director, they'll throw you all this reference material. they say, hey, you need to pick out a logo for the company playtone so we can start putting it up on the walls and use it in the stationery and what have you. and as soon as i saw the logo that they had i said, oh, well if i ever form a company, i got to call it playtone.
olympia, wash. – the washington democratic party says it will donate contributions from controversial spiritual leader jz knight to the anti-defamation league and the campaign to uphold gay marriage. that announcement late friday follows the release of new video clips that show knight making offensive and at times bizarre comments about gay people and people from mexico.
hanks: i remember it vaguely, but i was too young to appreciate it. when i was really young, it was fireball xl5. it was mayor art. and i actually - in oakland, calif., ktvu channel 2 was on an independent station, and it started running a - very intelligent movies on saturday nights and sunday. it was called the premiere movie, and there all of a sudden i'm seeing a marriage italian-style on channel 2, you know, with commercials on it.
in a 2018 interview with the atlantic editor jeffrey goldberg, gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those trump has called the forgotten man and the forgotten woman, the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades.
and in this way, the brownies were really all over town. by late 1977, i think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. it was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. the brownies seemed to come from everywhere. and at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.
meraji: you have a long political career ahead of you. what's next for you?
drace: oh, yeah. let's do it.
the attorney general said i promised congress i would not do it without cause, and there is no cause. i will not do it. so he was fired. and the deputy attorney general became attorney general and was ordered to fire cox. and he also refused, and he was gone. the third person in charge was the solicitor general, who became the acting attorney general, and he carried out the order.
davies: alia volz's new memoir is called home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. we'll be back after a short break. this is fresh air.
hanks: i think, first of all - they are not men with nerves of steel. the thing that has attracted me to all of those characters is they are fighting the terror that is inside them. for example, in all the reading and all the - much of the research i did for saving private ryan was the terror that men in command felt in combat. and i have this verbatim from a number of people is that they were afraid of making the mistake that was going to get other people killed.

the debate didn't play out the way he expected.
woodfin: they want me to codify it in signing sanctuary. i'm going to do welcoming cities.
pifer: and i was probably on my third client of the day. and as we were leaving the room, that's when i checked my - i just looked at my phone. and a friend had sent a text. it just said, you know, mass shooting out in san bernardino. i hope you're ok. and my first thought was i don't work in san bernardino, you know, i'm fine. so i thought, well, shannon's out there. but it's a large county, and that's just kind of when it all started.
meraji: wbhm's gigi douban. she's the news director. she's fabulous. and mayor woodfin, thank you so much for doing this...
mcevers: do you yourself go out sometimes...
gross: you're putting this in the future tense as if you hadn't started doing it yet.

sagal: that was betsy sewell, the woman who made this pot in high school back in the '70s and saw it on antiques roadshow being mistaken for a valuable antique. congratulations, ben, you got it right. amy was telling the truth. you knew that. you've won carl's voice on your voicemail. and amy gets a point. congratulations. thank you so much for playing.
gross: what interested you in his voice? what were you able to pick up from - and i assume - were these fbi tapes? was this him being debriefed by the fbi?
gross: so what did you identify about this person, who is emotionally and geographically alone and lost, who's lost his confidence? it's kind of the opposite of the position we think of you as being.

despite the opposition democrats may face in such a crowd, christopher hale, a faith adviser to president barack obama's 2012 campaign, said he hopes they will reach out to religious voters in surprising places.
maybe symmetry is inherently pleasing. perhaps it is the whiff of cosmic clout. or it could be that in our divided times, uniting over something as indisputable as the date is just the divertissement we crave.
gross: you've had your wars, in terms of movies, you've never fought in one in real life. when you were introduced to war, through your parents' generation and through tv movies, what was your reaction to the possibility that maybe one day you'd have to fight in one?
woodfin: right. now, i think everyone here who was in birmingham know we've seen growth in several places. you can't necessarily control gouging of rent. but what you can do is put things in place just to make sure residents have notice, longer notice. and there are other legal ways and creative ways you can create to make sure residents aren't displaced.
gessen says putin and trump were elected president without really wanting the job. they ran not for president but for autocrat, and they did not expect to settle for anything less. putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say trump 2024 and trump 2028 and so on into the future.
demby: how is running student government at morehouse different from running, you know, a city?
that was a different line than trump took in an interview with cbs's 60 minutes that aired sunday but was recorded last thursday.
as you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? it wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with aids. and this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. there was little treatment. and it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. as your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?
wine-banks: it mostly complicated things, i would say. we had to be very careful to pay attention to what the senate was doing because we didn't want them giving immunity to anyone we felt should be prosecuted. we had to make sure that no one told us one story and the senate something else.
the following day, jonas called up his good friend essie weingarten, president and founder of essie nail polish. she loved the idea of a catnip pedicure. this summer, they will open six cat salons across the city, offering pedicures in 10 toxin-free colors, including purrfect (ph) pink, commonly calico and litter box lemon.
demby: now, does having a city that is as black as birmingham is - does that just make it bluer to start with, right? like, are you starting a little bit - you just - you have this, like, very deep democratic base here, i imagine?
sagal: so these are your choices. somewhere somebody who was supposed to know something got it wrong. was it from mo, a pilot who brought his passengers to swaziland, not switzerland; from amy, an antiques roadshow appraiser who mistook a high school art project for a valuable antique; or from peter grosz, a sexpert who gave his students a little homework that was too hard, let's say. which of these is the real person who misled somebody?
nicole: but you and daddy lasted quite a while, right?

meraji: before you were mayor, you worked in the city attorney's office...
gross: so listening through the potato chips when you were listening to the tapes of henry hill - did you pick up a lot of slang that he used - 'cause there's, you know, expressions through the film that you assume were a part of that, you know, wiseguy culture. so did you pick up, like, language kind of things that you thought were really interesting?
brennan: so in stand-up you can't really be that honest. and you can kind of just - you're honest a little bit in the set-up where you'll be like, my dad's deaf or whatever, and then you'll go from there. and then my - dad's not really deaf. but you know what i mean.
for decades, the united methodist church has officially judged homosexual activity to be immoral, barred gays and lesbians from serving as clergy, and opposed same sex marriage.

wine-banks: oh, at watergate, i never felt unaccepted. there were a number of episodes where you would have to say gender played a role. judge sirica made several, i would have to say, sexist comments. one was during my questioning of rose mary woods when he said, now, ladies, we have enough problems in this courtroom without two women arguing. and that was while i was cross-examining her, not arguing with her. he also said during my cross-examination of one of the defendants, robert mardian, mr. mardian, don't you know you can never win an argument with a lady?
all right. from the royal family to hollywood, this morning the stars woke up before dawn to see if they were named as nominees for the 92nd academy awards. the nominations were announced by actors issa rae and john cho. they were at the soon-to-open academy museum here in los angeles.

trotter finds the flurry of executive orders coming from the trump white house unnerving.
volz: i think it was a blow to him. i think it was a blow to his ego. and the story that i had grown up with in my family - and i don't - i'm not even sure when i was told this - but was that he left the hospital and went to a gay bathhouse and spent the day there, which is a difficult moment to begin with. that was one of the more challenging conversations i had with my father in writing this book, i have to admit.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) oh, just a few things. the numbers are flat. the story doesn't make - there is no story. what is the story? i'm going to see if they'll let me reshoot the whole thing. you think they'll spring for it?
this is just raw politics. we don't want somebody who's been nominated by a democrat — a claim that i would have never made at the time.

i gave up the case and i paid for his car, and then a few months later we went to city hall and got married. and i still don't believe in the idea of marriage, but i believe in her, and i've given up on the idea of being right.

prior to joining npr, kuhn wrote for the far eastern economic review and freelanced for various news outlets, including the los angeles times and newsweek. he majored in french literature as an undergraduate at washington university in st. louis, and later did graduate work at the johns hopkins university-nanjing university center for chinese and american studies in nanjing.
when i got to watergate, i had only a few years of experience.
siegel: marriage equality was taken up a lot more recently than abortion. is there any typical bias in favor of recent rulings, as opposed to old ones?
cornish: all right. now, i want to move to a question from rachel crugg. she got engaged last fall. and to her surprise, the pandemic actually brought her closer to her fiance. they aren't sick of seeing each other, but there is some monotony.
douban: so this goes way back for me. so when i was in high school - and this was - i've got to add - this was in new york - both my parents are from egypt. and my high school economics teacher said, so, gigi, are you going to grow up to become a terrorist one day?
we have a lot of our dreams tied up in our children, and it is hard to understand the obvious, which is that your children aren't here to live your dreams. your children are here to live theirs. when i came out to my own mother 20 years ago, she was 85. she was an evangelical christian. she was a republican, and i had a pretty good sense that my coming out as trans was not going to strike her as the greatest thing that had ever happened to her — and yet i came out to her. i told her the story and i started to cry. and she got up out of her chair and she put her arms around me and she said, i would never turn my back on my child. i will always love you. and i said, but, mom, won't it be a scandal when everyone finds out that i'm your daughter now? and she said, well, quite frankly, yes, but i will adjust. and then she quoted first corinthians and said, the greatest of these is love. she said to me, love will prevail, and in large measure, it has in my life. so in some ways what i'm trying to do for my own daughter is to follow the example that my own mother set for me and to allow love to prevail.
meraji: you're not making things up. all right. we have one last question. it comes from a listener named mallory mitchell (ph). she's 26. she's black. she's originally from alabama, and she has a question regarding mayor woodfin's election. let's hear it.
you can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. no, the real donald trump was the one we saw on saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-nazi march in charlottesville, virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. when he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. and his instinct said: do not attack the white supremacists.
this is the kind of thing robinson wishes her sex ed program had talked about.
in uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. gessen suggests trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of russian president vladimir putin.
in an interview with npr's morning edition, he said he is talking to a lot of folks to get some input on the bill and that he had boiled his thinking down to this central question: whether therapists could truly leave their values out of their work.

approximately 40 percent of those who start college do not finish within six years. ... that's a huge number, says laurie goodman, co-director of the housing finance policy center at the urban institute.
for meyer, the feelings about trump are mixed. he is thrilled about the way the stocks in his retirement account are performing. he figures the economy will continue improving under trump. but he is worried about race relations. a jewish cemetery in st. louis had been recently vandalized, and he was puzzled why anyone would want to do that.
woodfin: that's a good pop quiz, though.
davies: i wanted to just ask about the current president. i mean, it's clear that you believe from the facts and the law that impeachment and removal for office was warranted. as it turned out, you know, the refusal of the senate to consider additional testimony and evidence and the swift acquittal of president trump has left him in a perhaps stronger position than he might have been without it. certainly, that's the view of mitch mcconnell, who said that this was a political blunder for the democrats. you know, your area is law, not politics. but i'm just wondering, was it wise, do you think, for house democrats to pursue the course they did?
the state house eventually passed the bill by a single vote, but the tide was turning and a month later the state senate voted unanimously to kill the bill.
volz: (laughter) that question makes me laugh a little bit. so as a child, i was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. i had a lot of trust in her. she was always cool in a crisis. and i believed that she knew what she was doing. my parents, i would say, did not use the i ching to decide what i should or shouldn't be allowed to do. i didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. i kind of felt like i was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, i think, is pretty unusual.

before louise even figures out how to talk to the heptapods, she must square off against a hawkish military. for some reason, the fate of the entire world comes to rest on a stereotypical warmongering chinese general named shang who wants to start blasting before he even knows the aliens' intentions, let alone capabilities. it's so clunky. thank heaven for amy adams who makes even the silliest parts of the movie work. she's a grounded actress, direct, plain-spoken, but there's also something brittle about her, mysteriously brittle, as if there's been some trauma in her past and she can't quite breakthrough into the moment. that quality is perfect for louise, who seems to be searching for self as well as scientific knowledge. when the aliens arrive, she's in mourning for a lost daughter who's seen in dislocating flashes. somehow the heptapods hold the key to her past. her eyes come alive when she first beholds their writing, which looks like exquisite ink paintings on air currents that seem like water, as if squids were doing japanese calligraphy. when the revelations come, they're shocking and very moving. you just have to put that other part of arrival with the b-movie general out of your mind. the film is an inadvertent demonstration that hollywood studios and visionary science fiction writers inhabit a different time-space continuum.

it certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. and i said at the outset i would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. i said i would play it straight — that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who i thought could do an outstanding job. and merrick garland fits that bill.

news outlets in new hampshire media began using the phrase bathroom bill in their coverage of the bill, which focused the debate even further on bathrooms.
edelstein: louise's intrigued. who wouldn't be? and what follows is a tantalizing puzzle. she goes to the alien ship. her body is sucked into a long, vertical entryway where she has to adapt to changes in pressure and gravity. then she moves into a dark chamber where the aliens - they're dubbed heptapods - melt out of a mist behind a transparent partition. the strangeness is intoxicating. the director, denis villeneuve, has a gift for making that kind of strangeness seem like the human condition, the real reality. as in his films incendies, prisoners and sicario, he mixes penetrating closeups with chill, blurred backgrounds. it's as if his characters live in a void where they're forced to rethink everything they thought they knew. what louise senses is that her job won't be to learn a new vocabulary. mastering the heptapod syntax might require a change in our brains, which might even end up challenging the concept of linear time. arrival is based on the story of your life, a short story by the brainy sci-fi cult author ted chiang, and the part of the movie that's closest to its source is great stuff. chiang's story isn't really about an invasion. the invasion is a device for exploring what happens as we move from a universe of newtonian cause-and-effect into the realm of quantum physics. that idea is in the film, and it's riveting. but there's another equally insistent plot straight from the '50s sci-fi b-movie playbook.
volz: i don't want to be an apologist, either. so, you know, clearly, this was not an ideal situation.

it's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation.
liotta: and you don't usually rehearse like that. it was just lorraine, bob, joe and myself and marty. and joe is a great storyteller. and he was telling a story - that actually happened to him at a restaurant once. and he was telling that story. and marty thought, wow, that would be a great place to put a scene like that. and, you know, marty just - you know, he's a genius. so during rehearsal, joe and i just played around with it. and then we would keep working at it and shaping it. and the improv became part of the script.
president obama: well, i think merrick garland is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation. and it is a testimony to how good he is that, you know, he has cropped up as a potential supreme court justice for a very long time.

americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another african american's death in police custody, the ravages of covid-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life.
so i talk about my father and i reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. it was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. it upset him. and one of the things that i think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. and when i said that it was both cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. it made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? i thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.

martin: so in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as i think many people will remember. but they've been on the books for decades, so i think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? what's the difference?
woodfin: first thing is this - is that i'm not. like, we're not going to use our police to do anything around what i call rounding up people. we just don't believe in that. i don't believe in that as mayor. i've had a clear, direct conversation with my police chief. i've had a clear and direct conversation with my chief of our city jail. we're not in that business.
when 2011 began, the worst recession in two generations was technically over, but annica trotter, ray meyer, and jennifer and brian barfield were unemployed and searching for work. six years later, their experience demonstrates life doesn't just snap back to normal after a job loss. their economic recovery remains incomplete and in some ways their story is america's story.
we had a very candid conversation. he's chief judge of the d.c. circuit, so i assume that he either reads the washington post or listens to npr, and i think had a pretty good sense of the posture that majority leader mcconnell took immediately after justice scalia's passing — the notion that the republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.

wine-banks: she was feisty for sure. we definitely had a situation where i knew that nothing that i got from her would be easily obtained, that i was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. but at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. i, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at camp david - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape.
gessen says the institutions and traditions americans thought would protect them have proven weak because they were not built to withstand a personality such as trump. the author had little faith that robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election would be the magic bullet that would rid washington of trump. instead, gessen writes, it drew attention away from what trump was doing in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.

leah abrams: i grew up and i spent my whole life in north carolina, where race and identity played integral roles in my upbringing. yet, being in alabama, i feel like i've noticed that race and segregation are more explicitly entrenched in daily life. in particular, a friend talked about being warned from a young age not to talk to white women because of his county's violent legacy of lynching black men for even looking at white girls. i feel like i haven't met many interracial couples in my time here at all. is it really that taboo to be in an interracial relationship in alabama? if so, why?
well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as i said earlier, was that, number one, i think he's the best person for the job. number two, i think he's a consensus builder. and the court would benefit from that at the moment.

in the wake of that accident — it turned out to be a drunk driver, and i assumed that that driver would pay for my car, but it wasn't that. it was the opposite. somehow in the paperwork and the police work or whatever, i was made to pay for the other driver's car. the unfairness of it really spun me out. i ended up in this crazy — i mean, i got a subscription on netdetective.com, where i'm looking up the other driver's name and i considered calling him at one point, directly, being like, this is insane! and there's lawyers involved, and it really spun me out, and at a certain point i realized that this is not going to resolve.
he went in high gear and it was so fast for me, barfield said, referring to the president's flurry of executive actions in the early days of his presidency. i was saying in my head, 'slow down, slow down ... let some dust settle here from that last thing you signed before you sign another big thing.'

wine-banks: it does. and i hate to draw parallels to today, but how can you not when you look at what attorney general william barr did in terms of the mueller report and so many other things? he misled the public and withheld the actual facts until the narrative had been set and people accepted it. and then when the truth came out, people were - well, he said, and i believe that, even though that was completely untrue.

daniel hoffman-zinnel, executive director of one iowa, an lgbtq rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to democratic candidates.
well in fact, the american people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the united states with sufficient electoral votes. and they also decided that the republicans would be in the majority. they didn't say, we're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. they said, no, you're the president for four years, and mr. mcconnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the senate.
wine-banks: even to this day i remember how devastated and disappointed i was listening because imagining can never be as bad as actually hearing the president committing crimes. and it's not just the expletives, deleted language that was disturbing, but it was the fact that in the oval office, these conversations were taking place about paying hush money to make sure that the watergate burglars never said that they were hired by the white house and the committee to reelect, that they were told to commit perjury. one of them was told to leave the country.

and i was down in my career. so to take on something if it didn't work - maybe it would make things worse. and then i said, wait a second. the whole point of me doing this is to take on challenges, to keep growing as an actor and not really caring - one of the biggest downfalls for any actor is fear of judgment. and so if you start acting and you start thinking about and worrying about what other people are going to say about it, you'll never really fully commit to who it is and what it is that you're playing.

but the illnesses varied a lot. and there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. some people got the pneumocystis carinii. some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. some people had the kaposi's sarcoma lesions. the variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. and it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. and this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.
gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. one is hungarian sociologist bálint magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a mafia state, ruled by a crime family in which one man distributes money and power to all other members. (viewers of the sopranos will understand how this model works.) magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation.
all of which means conditions are ripe for president trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says new yorker writer masha gessen in a new book surviving autocracy.
justice scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. but if you think about when the supreme court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. and judge garland, if you look at his work on the d.c. circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. and i think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by republicans.

justice kennedy was confirmed by ronald reagan, and i'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. but ultimately, he was confirmed. and he was confirmed in the last year of president reagan's office. so we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the supreme court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the supreme court, but the integrity of the senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.
gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including npr) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. in part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all.

in some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. the biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret. and if you have a secret that is as profound as the question of who you are, it's something that's going to eat at you all the time. so it used to be i'd wake up in the morning and i'd think, ok, we're gonna do the guy thing again now. and now i wake up in the morning and i don't think about it. in a way, gender has become something i think about a whole lot less.
then they will tell stories about act two of their lives, which is, well, that was during the war. and that was during the war meant, is that we were in stasis. we didn't know what was going to happen. i found myself - my dad found himself studying hydraulic engineering for the navy in pocatello, idaho. and then was shipped off to some place in the south pacific. and during those five years, the future was a big x. it was a mathematical formula that had not been seen through.
volz: not back then, and i'll tell you why - she never got busted. and so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. and one of the things that's interesting in the brownie mary and mer the brownie lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. well, poor brownie mary kept getting busted. and she had a wonderful way of handling the press. she was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. and the press just loved her. they just ate it up. and so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. and my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. she didn't get busted. she didn't go to the press. but she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.

hanks: well, first it's the dilemma that alan clay is in, which is a dilemma, i think, of our time. if you're going to sum it up in one word and one word only, you would say, alan clay is dealing with china. the fact that china has taken away the companies that he's worked for, the living that he used to make, and it's representative then of all the other failings that he's experienced in his life. he's divorced. he's got a kid. he can't afford college - college for her. and he's now taken whatever skill set he had, which is really, basically, selling things, and he is going to have to go off to a place as alien on the planet earth as i think mars is in the solar system, the kingdom of saudi arabia - accent on kingdom.
in addition to patrick, they had a daughter, nicole mckenna.

liotta: i've been taken care - for weeks, i'm being taken care of by this nurse. well, like i just say, this nurse - i end up falling for her. and i end up marrying her but then eventually find out that she was the richest woman in america. and she said that she had a different name than what it is that she had. so me being - i was playing the nicest guy in the world, joey perrini. that's why, again, these tough guys in something wild and all this stuff is kind of funny because in the soap i was really principled and religious. and because she lied to me, i got an annulment. and who wouldn't?

demby: so when we got this question, we decided to do a little digging. and according to a report from the pew research center, metro areas in the south are the least likely to have new marriages be between people of different races. the birmingham hoover metro, in particular, was in the bottom 10 for new interracial marriages in the whole country. only about 6 percent of newlyweds in birmingham are interracial couples. anybody want to guess where the no. 1 - no. 1 metro area for interracial marriages is in the united states? just take a wild guess.

this is fresh air. the new album everything is love is credited to the carters - shawn carter and beyonce knowles carter, better known as jay-z and beyonce. the married couple has released a new album that's heavily autobiographical and blends hip-hop and r&b in a way that our rock critic ken tucker finds very intriguing.
jillson: and now i think people have real questions about what the upside of george p. bush as a politician and an officeholder actually is.
otto sanchez: (as raul mendez) oh, i remember. you wanted to protect parks and schools from the drug trade. i trusted your assurance that no one else would push into that territory.
her letter cited a sense of responsibility for both law and justice:
liotta: i don't know. it just made good television, i guess. i don't know. i have no idea why they all started doing it, but they did. and at the end of it was this guy's name. it was troy - i don't remember the - his name. but michelle, my ex-wife, called him, said who i was, and people - by then, i was well-known. you know, i was making movies. and he found my birth mother within a day. and he called her and asked - god, this - i think i'm going to get emotional. i don't know how much i can really talk about this. this is very odd. anyhow, we found her. and i met them. and it was a trip. i've told this story before. and they got mad at me for telling it because i told it on
on the process of writing don't think twice
sagal: so dove this week introduced a line of soap bottles that are intended to look like different types of women's bodies.
cornish: ...this question is relevant in the pandemic age and not.
rocca: he fired gary busey with more tact.
ivanka trump points out to her 7.6 million twitter followers that most of us won't be around on the the next eight-digit palindrome date of 12-12-2121.
thank you, bill. thank you, everybody.
justice lawyers had been in courts all over the country this past weekend on the opposing side of refugees and travelers, sometimes making weak arguments and stating they didn't have enough information about the executive order and its legal underpinnings.
sagal: here is your next quote.
gardner: arab ruling families are particularly watchful over the female members of the family. the men have a - far more freedom, but the honor of the family rests with the women. this is why it's really kind of lifted a bit of a lid on the gilded palace life. it's very clear from the testimony in the video of sheikha latifa that she was in a kind of gilded cage. now, many people would say she had every possible luxury, what - she wanted for nothing. but she, obviously, didn't want to be there. she wanted to get away and live a normal life, and that wasn't being offered to her. the same happened to sheikha shamsa, another sister who tried to escape in 2000 and is now in dubai, back in the palace.
rocca: swaziland is a subtropical landlocked monarchy in southern africa about 11,000 miles from switzerland. i felt terrible about the mixup, said pilot brad grossman. lately, i've been suffering from a lot of waxy buildup so my hearing's not what it was.
sagal: comey's like, well, we have 41 openings - oh, 42.
grosz: the four-hour session ended with dr. benjamin introducing the couples in attendance to a new position that he created called the screaming lotus. now, the exact configuration of the bodies in this position is a little tricky to describe on npr. but suffice to say, it involves significant balancing, rotating and lifting and as it turns out intense muscle pulling and ligament tearing...
student loan debt is still a headwind, but they're at least being buoyed by stronger incomes and employment, he says.
gessen sees trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power.
south carolina is famous for its rough-and-tumble politics — in 2000, for example, there was a whisper campaign that john mccain had fathered a black child. he wound up losing to eventual president george w. bush. it derailed his candidacy. with as wide a field as this one, and the stakes being so high, watch out for more dirty tricks. the primary will likely further winnow the gop side. donald trump has a big lead in the polls; ted cruz is hoping to win over socially conservative voters in the northwestern part of the state; jeb bush, marco rubio and john kasich are contending for the significant portion of establishment republicans.
now, you think, well, that's an intimidating prospect. but we ended up shooting in it (laughter), so we used it as a location for one of the - a couple of the scenes from our movie. so right there it's like - it's a mosque - are we allowed to be there? well, in fact, yes, you are. and, in fact, you can bring your movie crew and shoot a scene in there.
we actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the circuit courts, something that's never happened before. so my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. today, we start our end of summer series featuring some favorite recent interviews. we begin with tom hanks who plays captain sully sullenberger in the new film sully, which opens next week. i'll just do an abbreviated recitation of his films - splash, big, sleepless in seattle, philadelphia, apollo 13, toy story, that thing you do, saving private ryan, you've got mail, charlie wilson's war, captain phillips and bridge of spies.
gross: that's ray liotta and joe pesci in a scene from goodfellas. so that's such a crazy scene. like, the joe pesci character is so crazy. like, that's an example of it because you had every reason to think that he was actually threatening you because that's how crazy he is. there's a scene where he shoots the michael imperioli character in the foot just kind of for no reason and later just kills him. so what was behind that scene? like, what's the difference between how that scene looked in the original script and how it looked on screen?
gross: what did you want to watch? what were your favorite tv shows that made a lasting impression on you?
and they - it wouldn't be the people that i would normally hang out with. and i didn't care what they thought 'cause here i am thinking, i'm just going to be here for one year. it doesn't matter. so for some reason, i just really committed and listened to what bucket said. and thank god he was an acting teacher who was - it was kind of the stanislavski, you know, the russian director and acting teacher. i just listened to what he said and kind of understood and just learned.
it's pretty clear that the vitriol in this is not the kind of thing that we support as a democratic party. we strongly believe in equality and inclusiveness, strong says.
i have been unemployed so long they just said, 'well, you don't count.' you don't receive benefits, you don't file anymore, so you're one of the ... 9 percent that just don't count anymore.
hanks: ...holding the label to himself. then we lived - when we lived with my aunt, my dad was separating from his second wife, and we went and lived with his sister. and my dad grew up in a very, very strict methodist household that had been transformed for his sister then into the nazarene church. and that was - they didn't speak in tongues, but it was a very strict, fundamental, christian social circle that we lived in.

dating during a pandemic is hard. two experts take listener questions on how to do it well.
and it was a lucrative living, without a doubt. and there were some people that were going to be exciting to work with. and i had stacks and stacks of versions of those movies that were kind of just versions of other people that i'd played before. and after playing jimmy dugan, the washed up baseball player, in league of their own, i don't think i have an awful lot of moments of clarity in regards to anything, but i did sit down with my crackerjack team of showbusiness experts - a guy named richard...
i was expecting them to enter the room and kidnap me, she said of security officials who were outside the airport transit hotel where she barricaded herself earlier this month. that's why i wrote a goodbye letter. i decided that i would end my life, before i was forced back to saudi arabia.
woodfin: it does - it is a very - it's a huge democratic base here, but that that goes for the entire city, black and white.
the carters: (singing) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. stack my money fast and go fast, fast. fast like a lambo. scoot, scoot, scoot. jumping off the stage. crowd better savor. i can't believe we made it. this is what we made, made. this is what we're thankful. this is what we made. i can't believe we made it. this a different thing. have you ever seen a crowd going ape [expletive]? give me my chain.
greene: all right - something to note there, obviously. well, those films you just noted for best director, all also nominated for best picture. and can't that be a funny category. you can have, like, five. you can have 10 nominations due to this ranked voting system. and this year, they settled on nine.
greene: ok, we've been speaking with ted shaw. he's a distinguished professor at the university of north carolina school of law, where he also directs the center for civil rights. professor, thanks so much for joining us this morning.
and there was something else. at the age of 6, raja herself was questioned by an american embassy official in islamabad. she says she was asked: do you believe in democracy or do you believe in communism?
klein: b, his nickname was killer mike - he wasn't a rapper, though, he just murdered a lot of people?
volz: oh, absolutely. so there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. but it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. and it was very small. and marijuana was still, in the american consciousness, not considered a medicine. it was considered a party drug. well, the situation with hiv/aids was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. it was 15 years. and this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. let that sink in for a moment.
mcevers: oh, wow. what did you come to learn about what happened, you know, that day and what he did?
i think being behind a screen when people don't see my face, it's way easier to talk to people, she explains. so i can just be this westerner running around and no one cares — like that's just me now.
davies: while dean was telling this story to the senate and on television to the world - i mean, i remember this very clearly - he was also talking to you in the prosecutor's office and giving you...
davies: you were born while the business was going. and after your mom recovered from the birth, she started bringing you along on her deliveries. what was that like? what did you learn about how she carried you, kind of how you fit into this whole thing?
grosz: ...because unless you're a cirque du soleil performer and your partner is a professional weightlifter, you're probably eased into the screaming lotus.
i had to get myself together 'cause we had to, you know, get ready and still do the movie. and i had a scene to shoot. i grew up only 45 minutes from the city. so the crew, joe pesci - they came to my mom's funeral. it was really, really - it wasn't special. but it was special and nice. but that's the reality of what happened.
totenberg: both these lists were compiled largely by the conservative heritage foundation. and the names range from very conservative to very, very conservative. none is a household name. indeed, some of the most well-known conservative judges and lawyers in the country aren't on the list. but i'm told this nominee will come from the lists.
i don't know a pathway forward for a democratic candidate to win back the states we lost in 2016 without winning a higher percentage of the evangelical vote, hale said.
frank adonis: (as anthony stabile) tommy, you know, you got it all wrong. see...
michael treadwell sat at the back of a courtroom in new hampshire. he wore a windbreaker and khaki pants and leaned over his work boots with his elbows on his knees. at first it looked like he was chewing gum — a bold choice in a courtroom. but when he spoke it was clear: he wasn't chewing gum, he was chewing his own gums. michael doesn't have any teeth.
the rolling stones: (singing) but i think i've just made the biggest mistake of my life...
david byrne: there's an island in a bay. loco de amor. she's got most peculiar ways. crazy for love. otocume yande. otocume yande. like a pizza in the rain. loco de amor. no one wants to take you home. but i love you just the same. my wild thing. hey, hey, my wild thing. my little wild thing. hey, hey, my wild thing. hey, hey, hey. yen yere cumbe. yen yere cumbe. loco de amor. loco de amor. yen yere cumbe. yen yere, yen yere, yen yere, yen yere, yen yere cumbe. wild thing, my little wild thing. hey, my wild thing.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) yeah, look how well that turned out. i was thinking maybe you could come to the editing room for a few weeks, you know, and maybe you'd see some things that i don't see. i'm feeling a little lost right now.
the nation is trying to catch up with a rapidly changing world. and people aren't quite sure how to define where we stand.
sagal: twenty-four years older, which by coincidence again, is exactly the same difference in age between donald trump and melania.
volz: i've done a lot of thinking about this. and i think it's pretty interesting. my dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. he described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. he describes it as being like looking at god. and my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.
this kind of ideological thinking is like that of the class-struggle sessions during the cultural revolution, cao says, referring to a violent period in the 1960s and 1970s in china when chairman mao zedong sought to root out political enemies.
i have not had conversations like that.
woodfin: i think one of the things that makes our city different is that we're the economic development engine of the entire state. when you think about workforce that the organizations, whatever lane they're in, whether it's health care or whether it's financial services, manufacturing, which are some of our top three industries here in our city, i think about their workforce becoming younger. so all my friends - when i moved back here 15 years ago, no one my age at 22 and 23 wanted to be in the city. they wanted to go to atlanta. they wanted to go to nashville. they wanted to go somewhere else.
volz: so i have a very intimate relationship with my mom, and it's nothing unusual for us to talk about her very personal feelings about things both from the past and today. but i started this book having been estranged from my dad for many, many years. and really, for the first couple of drafts, i didn't ask his side of the story because i didn't know how.
jay-z: (rapping) y'all know how i met her. we broke up and got back together. to get her back, i had to sweat her. y'all could make up with a bag, i had to change the weather. move the whole family west, but it's whatever.
supporters of the bill tried to push back against the rhetoric, noting that the bill permitted no such thing.
douban: ...churches, parks, restaurants. you know, a lot of times, there's - pretty much segregated, right? so you don't have to work that hard to stay away from somebody in another race. it's almost kind of done for you in the circles that you kind of grow up in.
people kill homeless people, violence and everything else, treadwell says. it can be a very dangerous life to live in. i don't suggest jail as an alternative. ain't no kinda life.
no matter what we've done, there comes a point where you think, ... 'when are they going to discover that i am, in fact, a fraud?'  hanks says. originally broadcast april 26, 2016.
the old ladies in the villages, the old men in the villages, the young boys in the towns and villages, are all celebrating that the united methodist church has maintained its traditional view of the bible, says dr. jerry kulah of liberia, general coordinator of the church's africa initiative. other denominations all across africa are celebrating the united methodist church. that is the kind of euphoria being expressed right now across africa.
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints officially disavowed the principle of plural marriages in 1890, though the church acknowledges that the practice continued and was condoned for decades afterward.
maureen corrigan picks books to close out a chaotic 2017
hanks: ...i played an overgrown - 13 years old, which your listeners might recognize from today's interview, as a matter of fact. but then we - i fell into a movie called league of their own in which i was playing, essentially, a washed-up big leaguer. and after i'd had that experience, i was still in my mid-30s. i had an awful lot of opportunities and offers in order to go off and make a certain type of film, which is, you know, some brand of light comedy, some brand of, you know, quasi-romantic drama that all ended up being under the rubric of, will i ever find the person of my dreams?
sagal: ...mistakes a high school art project for a valuable antique. your last story of a guru stepping in doo-doo comes from peter grosz.
taxpayers in hillsborough county, n.h., have spent $63,000 over the last six years keeping treadwell in jail for little more than trespassing.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies back with the interview terry gross recorded with ray liotta. he stars with jennifer lopez as corrupt police detectives in the new nbc series shades of blue. he starred in martin scorsese's 1990 film, goodfellas with robert de niro and joe pesci. when we left off, he told terry that he's met 13-year-old kids who told him, to his surprise, that they've seen the film.
meanwhile on monday, a team of turkish and saudi investigators entered the saudi consulate in istanbul, the associated press reported. it was unclear whether there would be much of anything to investigate forensically, given that so much time has passed since khashoggi was last seen.
liotta: (as henry hill) just - you know, you're funny (laughter).
thank you, bill. thank you, everybody. it is great to be back in salt lack city. salt lake, of course, is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains. later on, we're going to be talking to somebody who specializes in descending those mountains rather quickly, olympic gold medalist hannah kearney. but first, we want to congratulate our friend terry gross and her staff on this week's 30th anniversary of the show fresh air. it is an awesome thing.
the vanderhelms say they believe that being gay or trans is a sin — a sin that a person can resist. steve compares being homosexual to lying, overeating, lust. he says it's no different than me in my younger days looking at pornography.
at the grand rapids pride center, a rowdy group of about 40 teens gathers every week, and they talk about sex, gender and relationships. they have a rotating cast of adults called facilitators, who lead discussions and pull questions out of a hot pink box.
davies: yeah. it's interesting because there are a lot of circumstances where if a lawyer says something to you in an office, you can call him on it. you don't call out a judge in public.
joe pesci: (as tommy devito) pow, ping - i mean, i wish i was big just once.
are you taking this on the road?
meraji: are there term limits here?
bob vander plaats, president of the family leader, said he's sending invitations friday to the top seven democratic primary candidates in current polls.
as a young woman in an overwhelmingly male legal world, she faced demeaning comments in offices, courtrooms and the media, including a new york times profile of her titled a lawyer in miniskirts. and while she was investigating the watergate break-in and cover-up, her own house was mysteriously burglarized twice. fbi agents said a tap on her phone had been installed, then removed.
gross: so you were probably too young to have seen the real route 66 in its time?
demby: go mounties. i don't know what that means. go mounties.

mcevers: (laughter) sounds like a good voice. can i borrow it?
i have always been a huge admirer of his. i've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding supreme court justice.
sagal: you know what? they were right. we have gay marriage, now everything's gone to hell.
on thursday, grammy-nominated rapper travis scott performed to millions of fans worldwide — not during a living room set or from an empty venue, but via the massively popular video game fortnite.
for some conservatives, religious freedom means the right to act on their opposition to same-sex marriage and other practices that go against their beliefs. lgbt advocates and their allies, meanwhile, say no one in the united states should face discrimination because of their sexual orientation.
klein: so get two right and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, carl kasell's voice on their voicemail. bill, who is neal playing for?
sagal: bill, what is andy's topic?
woodfin: as far as i'm concerned, being a mayor period but then being the mayor of your hometown is probably the best political job you can ever have. i don't necessarily have to ever run for office outside of mayor again - like never.
the video appears to have been shot last year at knight's school of enlightenment near olympia. knight claims to channel an ancient spirit named ramtha. earlier this year she started giving generously to the state democratic party and democratic candidates. for several days, democrats have resisted republican calls to return the contributions. but benton strong, a spokesman for the state democratic party, says after the most recent videos came out.
i'm assuming you can just splice the question and i'll just answer it, so nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.
on why she didn't come out as trans or take hormones until she was in her 40s
well, you know what? that's exactly what i've done. and so there's no contradiction between what i'm doing and what joe biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.
president trump told reporters on monday morning that he had just spoken with saudi king salman bin abdul-aziz al saud, who he said firmly denied any knowledge of what happened to khashoggi.

but the objections yates raised in her letter pointed out that the olc review didn't consider statements made by an administration or its surrogates...that may bear on the order's purpose.

christy meyer: (as cayley) where are we supposed to eat?
gross: did you ever put it under your pillow and pretend to be sleeping when you were actually listening to the radio?
now to the deepening confusion over payments made to the adult film actress stormy daniels by - well, was it donald trump, his presidential campaign, his lawyer mr. trump says is really a businessman? and did that $130,000 payout violate campaign finance laws? matthew sanderson is an attorney for caplin and drysdale. he minded those campaign finance regulations for john mccain's presidential campaign. mr. sanderson, thanks so much for being with us.

cornish: and sam sanders, host of npr's it's been a minute.
liotta: i turned it down a bunch of times. i wouldn't do it. i was first asked to play him by tina sinatra or nancy - one of the sinatra - his daughters back when they did movie of the weeks. and they were doing a movie of the week of it. and i turned it down because i just didn't want to do it at that time in my career. then it came along.
i was essentially going through a second adolescence at age 40. and a lot of the kind of trial-and-error things that girls go through and women go through when they're 5 and 10 and 15 were things that i was having to figure out. and even now, there are some things that i'm still trying to figure out. like doing a french braid. i'm 61. i'm beginning to think that that ship has sailed. i'm probably never going to learn how to do that now. ...
meraji: so we have somebody who has some newfound information. it's making her angry and a little bit agitated. and she doesn't quite know what to do with that information. gigi?
cummings: (as rick halloway) i thought you didn't want talk about...
on monday, trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. racism is evil, trump said. and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the k.k.k., neo-nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans.
brown-james: thank you so much for having me.
nicole: tell me about daddy as a young parent.
donna: you know, i always felt so loved, but i always felt so honored by him too. i mean, i was never a gourmet cook. but we could have had mud pies, and he would have said, thank you.
davies: your parents were really interested in the occult, both, you know, psychics, i think. they thought of themselves as psychics. your mom read tarot cards. your dad was a graduate of the berkeley psychic institute. he at some point describes a vision that he has for a child. you want to describe this?
gardner: so there are different versions to this. the rumor - and we're not in the business of spreading rumors. i'm only going to tell you that this is what people are saying from the dubai side is that she has been having some kind of an affair or got too close to one of her bodyguards - a british bodyguard. but what her friends who know her very well have told me is that she is deeply concerned and afraid for her life after discovering details of the escape last year of her stepdaughter sheikha latifa, who is one of the daughters of sheikh mohammed. she was a 33-year-old dubai princess who put a video out online saying if you're seeing this, then i have not managed to escape. and she fled by sea. she got as far as the coast of india. and there she was, essentially, recaptured by indian and emirati commandos.

his liver is gone now because of the alcoholism, so we know he's not going to be around for too much longer. and this hurts the girls and i, sherri says. and it hurts me more, because i know the system could have done something.
he gets to yelling and screaming and hollering, and he's talking and he's cussing people out, swearing and carrying on and so forth and whatnot, copeland says. it scares people because they don't know what his intentions are.
gross: well, having several families also exposed you to several religions. i think i have this right - that your mother was catholic.
donna: i would want him to know, nobody has ever loved me the way he did. and i hope, i truly hope he felt the same way.
i can't praise too highly the performances of shahab hosseini as the increasingly fevered emad and longtime farhadi collaborator taraneh alidoosti as rana, whose wordless despair gives the movie's final section so much of its power. farid sajjadi hosseini plays an older man who shows up late and all but owns the movie. the salesman is nominated for this year's foreign language feature academy award, but it's unclear if farhadi would be able to attend the ceremony given the presidential order banning citizens of certain countries from visiting the u.s. he has said, in any case, that he won't come.
williams: (as gwen verdon) an hour ago when you walked in the door. how'd i do?
gessen clearly regards trump not only as a putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a putin impersonator. the author argues that trump models himself on putin, not because he expects to replicate russian political culture here but because he wants america to see him the way russia sees putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of an imaginary past.
loretta lynch: this law provides no benefit to society, and all it does is harm innocent americans.
siegel: meaning states could criminalize or legalize abortion. another legal issue he was asked about - does he support same-sex marriage?
whitaker: (as colonel weber) and now you heard it. what do you make of it?
pifer: i always knew - we talked about his response - what his response would be during a situation like this. i always had a feeling that you wouldn't run or hide. so he just did what came natural to him and covered the person closest to him and shielded her from a lot of bullets. you know, when they got down in his low southern drawl he just said, you know, i got you. it was just natural. the shot that killed him was to his right thigh. but i wasn't surprised that he shielded somebody.
davies: and do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?
brennan: yeah, 'cause my ex said that three mics is the biggest red flag in the history of red flags. do you agree?
large majorities of christians in the u.s. support same-sex marriage, though a majority of white evangelicals oppose it, according to a 2018 survey by prri.
pifer: ...(laughter) i would - i would probably be asked to have an evaluation of sorts. but...
in some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. the biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret.

trump fires acting attorney general for refusing to defend immigration order
but one phoenix business argues it cannot in good conscience follow that law — because they say it violates their freedom of speech and religion.
there's a way in which, when i look back in my 20s, i'm embarrassed because i was, i think, kind of sprawling in every direction looking for any kind of success at all: i'll audition for commercials; i'll audition for voice-overs; i'll audition for movies or tv shows or anything! and i was kind of cast in nothing. where that crescendoed was when i was about 30 years old, it was 2008, i got my own sitcom pilot with cbs based on my life. i couldn't believe it. bob odenkirk played my brother and nick kroll played my cousin, frances conroy played my mom. it was like a dream come true. i thought, oh, this is it. i've made it in this certain way. and when it didn't get picked up to air, i was crushed.
legislation either to uphold lgbt rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely.
in general, everybody should admit the world is changing really fast and it's hard for the conversations to keep up. i mean, it's hard to remember now, but when barack obama ran for president he was against gay marriage, he said.
what trump's comments monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear.
one of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of san francisco. and in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. but there was also some really dark stuff. you know, the peoples temple, which was led by jim jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. and then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, harvey milk that, i guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. how did all of that affect her?
pesci: (as tommy devito) funny how? i mean, what's funny about it?
brown-james: so valentine's day is hard. i've even been thinking about this for my lover and myself, right? do i put on, like, something sexy and - i don't feel like it. we tired over here. so (laughter) what do we do? look for things that you can do together. like, try and maybe send somebody a meal. maybe you have the same meal together. maybe you take a cooking class. but you can do things even though you're individually separated, but you're still sharing an experience and working towards the goal.
volz: no. my parents, i think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. and i was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. so i grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like robin hood outlaws. and i didn't question that for a long time.
gross: it's the silliest - it was the novelty record with a novelty dance. (laughter).
liotta: yeah, if i think something's funny, i think it's funny. and i just let it out. i'm amused by a lot of things. i love humor. i'm constantly joking around. it blows my friends' minds that i've never been in a fight in my whole life, and i play all these kinds of characters. it might seem exaggerated, but it's not. i just - you know, some people just have some very full laughter - full of joy - and have no shame or fear of letting that out.
in retrospect, when i look back on directing sleepwalk with me, i didn't know how to direct a movie. there's no way to teach someone how to direct a movie. you can go to film school, you can direct a short, but to direct a feature film, it's like waiting tables for the first time — you have to sort of lie and say that you've waited tables before. which of course leads to a lot of incompetent waiters who are liars. but directors are like that, too. you really don't know what you're doing, and i think in a lot of ways these ideas [of improv], these principles, are what got me through — this idea of, like, listen to people more than you talk. ... i don't know anything about costume design, but i hired someone whose work i admire and then i listened to her when she made recommendations. ... i think those are just really good rules for collaboration.
liotta: i guess different strokes for different folks. i guess when you grow up like that, when you're growing up in new york, and your father isn't making a lot of money, to see people who are - have a lot of money and power. you know, that kind of shows a power that they're parking wherever they want when you're not supposed to do that. that really influenced him a lot.

then, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of malbec, as ling and chan were enjoying their catnip, ling jumped up on jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. taking advantage of the situation, jonas grabbed a q-tip and some wet ones and figured out a way to give ling a waterless pedicure. he was elated, but felt that something was missing. what his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.
jennifer barfield: i want to hear him say he's crumpling up other trade agreements and changing that asap. that's what i really want to hear. even though i know he's got a lot of big fish to fry on his plate, that's the one that i want the most.
well, you know, i'm going to make the case — i'm going to make the case for a fair process. give judge garland a hearing; give him a vote. and look at the qualities of the man. that's what the american people expect. and, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that i've heard from mitch mcconnell and some other republicans is this notion that the american people should decide — we should let the american people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.
gross: so what was it about the dave eggers novel that made you want to adapt it into a film?
anticipating a new life in canada, alqunun wants to attend college and study architecture, she told the new york times. and she wants to experience what it's like to be a normal teenager. i want to do crazy things i've never done before, she said.

tooley, who personally identifies with the evangelical tendency in the united methodist tradition, says the long-standing church positions on matters of sexuality and marriage in the past reflected the influence of conservative methodists in the united states.

it's very unusual for the justice department to refuse to defend a law or an executive order, though it isn't unprecedented. during the obama administration, for example, top officials decided not to defend the defense of marriage act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. the supreme court eventually ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.
and so although i've always believed that he would make an outstanding supreme court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the supreme court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the american people's confidence in our justice system.
for years now, his life has looked like this: trespass in an apartment building, spend 30 days in jail; bother restaurant customers, spend 42 days in jail; panhandle aggressively, spend 30 days in jail.
nicole: what's your favorite memory about being married to daddy?
when you're talking about opening up restrooms and schools and in public places, it is just uncomfortable, unnatural and unwelcoming to many, many women and girls out there and i think that's what this really boils down to, said banfield.
bodden: the difference is his wife will live with him.
hanks: (as alan clay) well, maybe all the vendors are in here, and maybe we're just the first.
gross: you're going to be nice to me, right? (laughter).
douban: where are you from? and where are you from is kind of, you know, for me, i never know what they mean, whether people mean where are you from geographically - because i might not sound like i'm from the south - or ethnically. and so i'll say, well, what do you mean? and then they have, you know, sort of, you know - oh, i meant you don't sound like you're from the south, or ethnically, i mean, what's your ancestry, what's your heritage? i feel like sometimes it is a little jab, but other times, sometimes people just might not know, right?
sagal: landon, welcome to the show. you're going to play who's bill this time. bill kurtis is going to perform for you three quotations from the week's news. your job - correctly identify or explain just two of them. do that, you will win our prize, the voice of scorekeeper emeritus carl kasell to do whatever you will with. are you ready to play?
gross: so in a lot of your movies, you portray men in life and death situations, you know, war in saving private ryan. you produced band of brothers, also about world war ii. you were jim lovell in apollo 13. you were the captain of a ship taken over by pirates in captain phillips. you're finishing production on a movie called sully in which you play the pilot who remarkably landed - made an emergency landing on the hudson river after birds flew into the engines of the plane, disabling the engines. so these are men with like nerves of steel under pressure. do you feel like you have ever been tested like that in your own life?
beyonce: (singing) no need to ask, you heard about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. already know you know about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. watch your mouth when you're around us.
demby: and, also, who is better dressed - the dudes at morehouse or the city council of birmingham?
it was not exactly one day. it was less of a decision than, like, an erosion, maybe. ... but i remember there was one day when a barrier came down at a railroad crossing and it was snowing. it was probably january of 2000. so it was the new millennium. i remember that it felt like we were in a new era. and i just watched the cars of the freight train going by and started kind of daydreaming and thinking that question: how long are you going to wait before you leave your actual life? eventually, the barrier went up, the train disappeared down the tracks, but i was just sitting there in my car in this kind of daze until cars behind me started honking and wondering what was wrong with me. so that was the day i came home and i said to my wife, i think i'm gonna get back into therapy. we talked a little bit about the gender question before that moment, but that was the moment that i thought, i cannot keep living a life in which i'm not really myself.
wine-banks: he, jim neal, thought that possibly they were either fake tapes that would exonerate the president or - i'm not really sure exactly what he had in mind, but he really thought it was a trap. he agreed we had no choice but to subpoena them because that was just how it was, and we were going to have to fight it. but i never doubted that it was legitimate. the confirmation that we got from john dean was he was thrilled to know there was tapes because he believed he had been accurate in recounting all of the conversations he had, and he was relieved that he might be able to be proved correct. so his reaction to it led me to believe that this was good news for us.
sagal: hey. how are things in hickory, n.c.?
hanks: we were forced to in a couple of circumstances. i was the only one in my family who did not get a first communion because my parents broke up before they could put me in the catechism. but i remember masses in latin. but we - i thought, of course, well, that's what church is. but then these guys, literally like the book of mormon, they came around in white short-sleeved shirts and black ties, and they rode bicycles. and they convinced my dad's second wife that being a mormon was just the greatest thing in the world. and my dad said, you know what? if you - winnie - that was her name - sweet lady. he said, if you want your kids to be baptized in the mormon church, you go right ahead, but no way are my kids going to go through that.
beyonce: (rapping) ain't nothing to it - real one. ain't nothing to it - boss. ain't nothing to it - real one. ain't nothing to it - boss. i pay the cost. who's gonna take it off? i record then i ball. i've ignored a lot of calls. click, click. you ain't talking about nothing. i ain't got no time. got that dinero on my mind. oh, i got real problems just like you. tell that trick i don't like you.
meraji: all right. so i want to sum this up for mallory. she wants to know what makes birmingham different, and what you're saying is there is more economic opportunity here, there's an economic engine that's moving. it's drawing in young people. it's also a predominantly african-american city, which makes it tend towards being more democratic and progressive, and, you know, you've got young millennials who are out exercising their right to vote. would i have summed that up for mallory?

and now we're into this tug of war. this week, the justice department and the trump administration sided with the baker, said the government couldn't compel him to engage in free speech. and in their brief, said an artist cannot be forced to paint. a musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write. a baker can't be forced to make a wedding cake.
vigorous enforcement of the law during the mid-twentieth century did not deter the practice of plural marriage, sen. deidre henderson told npr.
williams: (as gwen verdon) so it's called children! children! it's from a brand-new writer. it's a terrific part, and then the play is just phenomenal.
hanks: (as alan clay) no, brad, we should wait until i talked to karim al-ahmad at 3 o'clock.
wine-banks: she was moved out of her office adjacent to the oval office to a remote office in the executive office building where she maintained a shrine to richard nixon until she was eventually, under president ford, moved to a separate building, a little townhouse on lafayette square across from the white house. and she wasn't allowed to send mail to the president or communicate with him and eventually became - she said it was like being a b-list celebrity instead of an a-list. it's ironic, but she lived in the watergate complex and had a nice lifestyle, eventually moving back to her hometown in ohio and basically being out of the limelight.
tucker: there are sultry grooves all over this album like that one, a song called summer. there's another alluring rhythm in boss, a song dominated by beyonce singing about being successful and in charge. she's the boss of the song title. as a soul music horn section toots affirmatively, she rattles off a verse about how the success and wealth she has is important to her not least for what she can leave behind for future generations of african-american children.
brown-james: mmm hmm. mmm hmm. i would say for jack and for everybody, learning to be by yourself is actually integral, and i want him to hold on to that. when they start to date, they're not going to lose themselves in somebody else's ish (ph). it's like, well, i don't really like this. i can be by myself and be ok. that is an integral tool to have when starting to seek out relationship.

'[l]ittle mayor signer — see-ner — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked richard spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. the crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'jew, jew, jew, jew' some shouted out. the rest burst out in laughter. and that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.
and so i — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just democrats, but a sizable number of republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. and what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) that's very funny.
jill wine-banks: well, it depends on what part of my career you're talking about. when i first started at the department of justice, again, i was the only woman trial lawyer. and no one really knew how to deal with me because they weren't sure whether to call me a woman lawyer, which is something i've always objected to. i think that distinguishes me in a way that's unfair from any other lawyer. i was a trial lawyer, not a woman lawyer. and so i've always corrected people on that particular thing.

legal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. a federal judge, ruling on a mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets, and may therefore be unconstitutional. other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the first amendment's bar on an establishment of religion.
wine-banks: probably at that moment i didn't. i have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. and i was really compartmentalized on, what questions do i have to ask while listening to her answers so that i can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? in retrospect, i definitely have sympathy for her because i know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't.
davies: well, jill wine-banks, thanks you so much for speaking with us.

this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in today for terry gross. our guest, alia volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. in the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in san francisco. volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every friday. as colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.

the justice department has sided with a baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. for the lgbt community, it's the latest disappointment from the trump administration.
meraji: it's sacred ground because it's where black people encountered the absolute worst evils of racism and fought back and fought for a society where equality and justice for all actually mean something. and you've written that birmingham today is really a testament to reconciliation. and i want to know - what did you mean by that? what does that mean for you?

texas holds the first-in-the-nation primary next week. voters will make choices in hundreds of races, including governor and u.s. senator. further down the ballot, there's a race that could decide the future of one of america's political dynasties. from member station kut in austin, ben philpott reports.
davies: right. and it's interesting when you compare that to the recent investigations into the trump administration, when special counsel mueller was looking into looking into, you know, the deeds that he was looking into it. and initially the white house did cooperate and provide a lot of documents. once the impeachment inquiry began, they refused to honor subpoenas. it really makes a difference whether some of this basic information is provided, doesn't it?
sanders: i have a more practical question or a suggestion for clark. like, this pandemic year has changed the ways in which we have to be here or there to work for a lot of us. and so maybe there's a way that they can just build in a little more together time physically, more than once a month. i don't know.
felber: that's exactly what you mean.
totenberg: i don't expect the nomination until we have an official president trump, until he's sworn in. he has a government that can vet candidates. he can officially give them to the fbi to do a thorough background check.
you're at a table. and the joe pesci character, tommy, is telling this story. everybody's laughing at the story. you're laughing the hardest. and after the story ends, he looks at you and he says, what's so funny? so let's play part of that scene, and the scene starts with you just laughing a lot at the end of his story.
here's the problem we have, though: if in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, we've got another excuse for not confirming a democratic president's nominee?
meraji: is this a conversation that happened for you?
i really ended up being very much accepted in the department of justice organized crime section, but it took me over a year to get my first trial, and that was because i was not even aware - i had no role models and no one to look to. and it took me a while to realize that the men i started with were starting to try cases. we all start doing appeals, but they had moved on to trials, and i hadn't. and so i had to confront my boss and say, how come? and he said, well, because you're a girl, and you'd be much more vulnerable in a courtroom. in appeals, you're just with lawyers. but in the courtroom, you'd be with mafia members. and i simply said, well, what didn't you notice about me when you hired me as a trial lawyer? and that's how i got my first trial.
wine-banks: we got them from the white house. it was something that helped enormously. we had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. and it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. so, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. but when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the white house saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. and we were very precise because we had the call logs. and we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. and it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations.

volz: to an extent. my parents weren't trying to scare me with it. but from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if i told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. so i did know from the very beginning that if i told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.
and you voted to not end debate on the alito nomination. and if i understood you correctly at your press conference, what i thought i heard you say was, you know, i knew that it was a meaningless vote. you got a pass from the leadership. you can do this.

turns out, while the organic litter might make the technicians feel greener and more virtuous, it does a terrible job of stabilizing nuclear waste. the drums almost immediately started leaking radioactive goo. their frightening solution falls into the it's-so-stupid-it-might-just-work category. they're storing the drums now inside bigger drums. what could possibly go wrong?
woodfin: when we look at the history of america, we haven't always been honest. well, what's on paper wasn't necessarily in practice. racism was real. it was tangible. and the difference between birmingham and any other city in america at that time was our differences were actually wrecking on the world stage. so everyone saw it. they saw the brutality. they saw the racism. they saw the bigotry. they saw the evil. they saw it. at the exact same time, they saw the fred shuttlesworths of our world, the martin luther king jrs. of our world, others fight back. and in that reckoning, we were able to get some - a lot of wins out of that for black people.

not knowing what happened makes us consider the destructive social forces that helped put that woman on that staircase at that time. in my favorite movie of farhadi's, about elly, a young female teacher disappears while visiting colleagues at their beach house. as they learn more about their absent guest, the focus subtly shifts to the trauma of her life and by implication, the lives of many working single women in modern iran.
farsad: but the thing about marine le pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as trump, i think, because she spoke in complete sentences. and her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.
now, she ends up being a very important figure in this case. people would know her name because it turned out that one of the critical conversations just a few weeks - a short time after the break-in - conversations in the oval office had an 18 1/2-minute gap where only a hum appears on the tape, very suspicious. a lot of people in the white house had access, but she ends up on the stand having to explain this. and you were the one cross-examining her. tell us about that.

he says his managers had received numerous complaints from students about remarks he had made in lectures in previous years, but his managers only quietly reprimanded him before dismissing the claims. the problem is not that chinese students and colleagues are reporting their professors. that phenomenon has always existed, says shi.

demby: i thought you were going to say, like - we going to have to scrap on the stage. what we doing? what we doing?
and i would expect that the older ones and the younger ones will get knocked off. and the person will have a track record that attracted trump and, therefore, will unattract a lot of democrats and their constituencies.
to those among you who repeatedly used the label 'the bathroom bill,' who incorporated this into every headline and story lead and failed to tell the whole and complete truth of this legislation, i say you are not journalists. you have served merely as stenographers to ignorance, hatred and discrimination, said then-state sen. jackie cilley.
mr. president, thank you so much for your time. we appreciate it.
woodfin: i think it has. this trade war is real in the state of alabama, not just birmingham metro area, where bibb county is next door and tuscaloosa county's next door. and we have residents who are employees of these organizations where the auto industry - it works very well for the state of alabama. that doesn't work either for birmingham or for our state.

(soundbite of future islands' seasons (waiting on you)
woodfin: he just answered my - he just answered for me.
douban: that's deep. but it's on the other side as well, where, you know, a lot of african-american men might still have that sort of - you know, maybe have been told by their fathers not to talk to white women, not to look at white women, not to get into relationships with white women because it's just not going to go over well. it's just not something that you do. and it wasn't that it was just inconvenient or anything like that. but, i mean, there was a point in history - and it was not all that long ago - where your life would be in danger if, you know, you were a black man pursuing a white woman.
brennan: yeah, my dad's dead. yeah. that's correct.

volz: yeah. of course. so as a kid, it was something that i was - of course i was aware of it. you would see - the presentation of aids was so dramatic physically. and it could happen very quickly. we'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. and somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.
hanks: gary - my producing partner, gary, is a - he's got all sorts of gold records from when he produced records for people like robert john, the lion sleeps tonight. he's done, like, smokey robinson records. so he's well-versed in the music business. some time in - not too long before i started writing the movie - i heard the saga of a drummer by the name jimmy nichols. do you know the name jimmy nichols at all?

after widespread condemnation, the family leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery had a disastrous impact on african-american families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an african-american baby born after the election of the usa's first african-american president.
fudan is one of at least three universities that have revised their charters since 2018, emphasizing unswerving loyalty to the communist party, an npr analysis found. they have downgraded or erased language about academic freedom from their charters, while adding a new clause: the university communist party committee is the core leadership of the school.
a student who created the chat group to organize the protest deleted the group from wechat, a popular chinese social media app, in the early morning hours before the event, after his school counselor got wind of the scheme and pressured him to withdraw.
it potentially could show the audience of the family leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said. so maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds — or at least get them to think more broadly.
bianculli: fx has made half of fosse/verdon available for preview. that's enough to recommend it highly, but not quite enough to allow for the rendering of a final verdict. i really like that it makes room for some of fosse's famous friends, like neil simon and paddy chayefsky, played respectively by nate corddry and norbert leo butz. and while i'm intrigued by others, like margaret qualley as ann reinking, i need to see more to see how this all plays out. that's because fosse/verdon, written and directed by a tag team of other producers and executive producers - including thomas kail, steven levenson, joel fields and charlotte stoudt - is all over the place, emotionally and artistically. it recreates scenes from classic stage shows and movies while framing them within a frenetic, sometimes fantasy narrative. that's exactly what bob fosse himself did while directing the 1979 movie all that jazz, which was his barely fictionalized story of his own physical breakdown while juggling work on several simultaneous projects.
last year, a performance by the electronic artist marshmello brought in millions of watchers, and other live events such as a kaiju film-inspired battle between a massive robot and sea monster.
mcevers: it was around 11 a.m. a husband and wife wearing ski masks had walked into the holiday party for the county public health department and started shooting people. the public health department is where shannon worked. mandy started calling his phone. because she had worked as a crisis counselor helping witnesses and survivors of traumatic events, mandy knew from her training that something wasn't right.
davies: alia volz's new memoir is called home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco.
gross: what our listeners can't see is that in that scene, you're not only laughing loudly. but it's like visually, you are laughing. like, your mouth is, like, way open as you laugh - like, your whole face is shaped like a laugh. it's as if, like, you're trying to prove, like, this is funny. i am enjoying myself. i'm all in on this joke. and there's even a collage on youtube of your laughter through the movie. was that a thing for you when you were making it - that you thought that this character had to just, like, demonstrate that he thought something was funny and that he was enjoying life?
from my short experience with him in government, he's not that kind of leader, trotter concluded.
if a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of lgbt people to be free from discrimination.

in the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? they clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [laughter]

brennan: i - it's - do it early.
but, you know, i think the way he described it — and i'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. he has loved being a judge for a very long time. he occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. he's got a great job.
liotta: i think i was throwing ashes on him - is - i think is what i did.
liotta: as far as what you were saying to begin with, in terms of kids knowing or not knowing, i do have kids that age coming up to me - mostly young boys. from their fathers - the fathers passed along music and books or whatever that affected them when they were younger. you know, a lot of times you pass it on to your kid. so they'd pass on field of dreams to their sons who played baseball. and some of the fathers that, you know, show their young sons - like, i've had 13-year-old kids come up to me and say, oh, my gosh, you were so good in goodfellas. and i'm thinking, oh, my gosh, what kind of parents do they have? that's a little too young to see that one.

i'm not worried about my religious freedom, curry said. i get up and go to church on sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me. my freedom to worship is protected in this country, and that's not going to get taken away. i have been in places where that's been infringed. that's not what we're talking about.
what if gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? it would not likely change gessen's mind about trump. but it might alter the writer's perspective on trumpism. it might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their american counterparts — the millions who voted for trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.
around 10 years old, we begin to lose who we are, when we start learning how to please ... when we start to internalize our social programming. so that's when we learn how to be a good girl, a strong boy, a good christian, a good woman. and, you know, over and over again, we hear from women that their taming, their social programming, came when they learned how to be quiet, and kind, and sweet, and accommodating, and pleasing, and pretty.

well, first of all what i would say is take a look at the appointments i've made since i've been president of the united states. i've appointed as many african-americans to the circuit court as any president ever; more african-american women on the federal courts than any other president; more hispanics, more asian-americans, more lgbt judges than any president in history.
(soundbite of song, that thing you do)
now you can imagine at that age? i had no idea what the word meant, she recalls.
we have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent presidential election was defined by them. yet it remains striking to hear trump imply that nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. it would have been naïve to expect the president to unambiguously condemn neo-confederates (heritage, not hate, etc.), but nazis? for reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the united states, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the confederate flag.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross, who has a cold today. we're listening to my interview with jill wine-banks. she's a legal analyst for msnbc, and she has a new memoir about her days in the 1970s as an assistant special prosecutor on the watergate investigation. it's called the watergate girl. when we left off, she was talking about president nixon's longtime secretary and executive assistant, rose mary woods, who was close to the first family and an integral part of the administration.

sanders: thank you, audie. this was fun.
simon: well, let me ask you about precedents. and a lot of people have referred to the john edwards defense. this, of course, former democratic presidential candidate who was acquitted by a jury and convinced them that he had made payments. gosh, i'm trying to remember. it involved the birth of a child to a campaign aide who decided that he would identify himself as the father. and he said, look, that wasn't to save my campaign. it was to save my marriage and the mortal embarrassment of my wife, elizabeth edwards, who was, then, mortally ill.
so i wrote a note next to my bed ... i wrote, 'mike! you have an appointment at café pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind!' it's so corny, and i would show up!

the day after the singing protest, members of the party youth league at fudan university posted a prewritten statement on wechat: the school anthem remains the same. not only does fudan have academic independence and freedom of thought, but it also educates the country's future leaders, strengthens the university and protects the country. the determination that led us to fudan in the first place hasn't changed. if given a second chance, i'd still choose fudan. professors who posted veiled statements of support for the protest on wechat were told to take their posts down.

liotta: ...you were doing all this blow. you were beating people up. but - and then i would see him for years. he had a rough life towards the end of his life. and i would see him, a lot of times, in venice. and he was just, you know, out of his mind on - you know, doing something - usually pretty loaded. i would see him leaning against trees or just sleeping on the beach. and i would bump into him every once in a while.
and i would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on earth.

south carolina prides itself on being the decider in gop politics. before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. but struggling former house speaker newt gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. he defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. that helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of south carolina, but a flush-with-cash superpac supporting romney, tore down gingrich as the contest moved to florida.)
shaw: well, i think these conversations are good to have. i think they're important to have as we deepen our understanding of what our national values and principles are. the question to me isn't whether we have these conversations. it's how we have these conversations. and i guess what disturbs me - i know what disturbs me - is when some people are treated as if they are not legitimate members of our society. that troubles me and its tone and its tenor. so that's part of a larger problem that we're having as a nation in this strange time in which we find ourselves.
volz: it has been an absolute pleasure, dave.

two of the executive producers of fosse/verdon should be noted at the start. one is nicole fosse, the real-life daughter of bob fosse and gwen verdon. another is lin-manuel miranda, whose broadway success with hamilton has been nothing short of phenomenal. his presence alone suggests that the musical numbers recreated here will be done with precision and reverence, and they are. and while her presence dictates that this biography of her parents is authorized, it is not an entirely flattering portrayal of either of them. the portrayals, however, are so good, it's almost a relief.

if you're a musical theater fan, just the title fosse/verdon is enough to make this new fx miniseries one of the most exciting tv prospects of the year. gwen verdon, who originated the onstage characters of lola in damn yankees and roxie hart in chicago, was one of the best dancers on broadway. bob fosse's particular style as both choreographer and movie director was dazzlingly different and, captured in such films as cabaret, still crackles with energy. this eight-part drama sets out to tell how they met, collaborated, fell in love, got married and had a daughter. but that's only part of the story, which is about a relationship that keeps going long after the marriage has been dissolved.
volz: absolutely. i - you know, i want to say that i was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. i was not left to run wild. i was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. so there's no neglect in that.
gross: that's my guest, ray liotta, in goodfellas. it's just so interesting to me how low his sights were set as a kid. you know, like...
sanderson: yeah. so this comes down to two things. one is - and this is the most important - what was the intent behind the payment? was it related to the election? the second is what the source - what was the source of money? and i think what's interesting about the last 48 hours is that there's been - the waters have been muddied considerably. so there was an existing narrative about why the payments were made, about the source of the money. and now...

woodfin: if i reflect back when i was 15 and 16, 17 in high school, i don't think that's something that you actually did for real. was it explicit not to do it? no. was it something that you just - that you felt? yes. now, she's right. i don't know how much more i can add to what she just said. my mother is married. she's in an interracial relationship. her husband is white. they've been married over a decade now. i think it's interesting watching my own mother, from a personal standpoint, be in an interracial relationship. i think for each generation we see, not just in birmingham, but in the state, things have changed for each generation for the better.
hanks: my parents were so disinterested in what was going on in my bedroom that i didn't have to pretend anything. i could stay up as late as i wanted to.
woodfin: no one wants to interact with the court system. no one wants to be a victim, a defendant. i don't even think the defense lawyers want to be there for real. but in my position, i have - i had a choice. i also had discretion. and it's easy - i've seen it - for people to be abusive in that position. but, for me, it was all about how to help people, how to bring issues to a resolve, how to heal victims but, believe it or not, how to help defendants as well.
in the aftermath of the conference action, the united methodist church is likely to lose some of its unity.
shaw: well, the state makes an argument, and how strong that argument is is up for grabs. the state cites federal court decisions that say that gender does not include sexual orientation or transgender and that transgender people are not a protected classification of people under federal civil rights laws. so - and it's part of the culture wars that have been going on. for people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws. and even the supreme court, which has been a conservative supreme court, has, of course, moved with respect to sexual orientation to ban discrimination in the context of marriage.
grove: i want to say macron.
in those days, coming out as transgender was unknown territory, at least it was for me. i barely even had a word for the thing that i felt. and as much as i knew i wanted to live my true life, i also felt that if i lived that life, it would almost surely lead to a life of marginality, of violence. i just thought, i might well be killed, that there was no place in the world in which i could live. there is no place in the world for me to be. ...
johnson: well, and the justice department briefing anticipated this argument. acting solicitor general jeffrey wall says race is different. there's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the first amendment. but those same classifications aren't so clear, the trump doj says, for sexual orientation. colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. and a divided supreme court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. there's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.
siegel: so, nina, in one case, he says a supreme court decision ought to be overturned. in the other case, the court's decision ends the discussion. is there anything different about those two issues in supreme court rulings?
amy adams: (as dr. louise banks) is that...
allendale public schools maintains that the sex education program it has used for a decade, called willing to wait, meets the requirements of michigan law, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sex until marriage. the superintendent, garth cooper, believes that lgbtq+ kids get the same thing from it as everybody else.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) well, that's - congratulations. when do you start?
there were efforts early on about some kind of compromise, he tells npr in a recent interview. i think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. it's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so i think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.

his campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. there's at least some evidence that sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, npr's sam sanders reports. there hasn't been any south carolina polling on the democratic side yet after iowa and new hampshire, though.
the ramifications of the general conference action are not yet fully evident, but fractures are likely — between progressive clergy and conservative laity, between young and old church members, and between methodists in the united states and those in africa, asia and other parts of what's known as the global south, mostly less-developed countries where conservative social views and a more strict interpretation of the bible are prevalent.

kurtis: landon won. good going, landon.
totenberg: well, people around trump acknowledged that he's no supreme court expert. but he knows what he doesn't want. and he doesn't want surprises. and by that, he means somebody like justice david souter, who was appointed by the first president george bush, and chief justice john roberts, who is anathema to many conservatives because he voted to uphold the aca.
a majority of u.s. delegates at the united methodist general conference opposed the conservative resolutions on sexuality and marriage, but the u.s. share of global methodism is declining while the church is growing in the global south, especially africa.

gross: we're listening back to the interview i recorded with tom hanks last april. after we take a short break, he'll talk about the different parents and different religions he grew up with. here's the title song from his film that thing you do. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.
my responsibility is to ensure that the position of the department of justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. in addition, i am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. at present, i am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am i convinced that the executive order is lawful. consequently, for as long as i am the acting attorney general, the department of justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until i become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.

on modeling marriage and motherhood for her children
with respect to judicial philosophy, i have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so i don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because i can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and i have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.
woodfin: no. no. we're not going to do that. i believe in welcoming cities. that is something that we are past exploring. that is something we're going to actually do. they put a paper in my hand and said, sign it. that's not how i necessarily govern. i read it. i turned it over to my legal department. but i also turned over to my legal department welcoming cities. and when we look at both of those, i think not only protecting our immigrant community but making sure we do things beyond ice is important.
and so i spoke to a sociologist at uab who studies race and culture. and she said there are a lot of young people who feel like that was 200 years ago in their minds, but in reality, we're not all that far removed from that part of history. so that still lives on in a lot of people. that said, the vast majority of people told me that, for the younger generation, it is more and more commonplace, and it's ok by them as opposed to their parents who might still be resistant to interracial relationships.

but one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. and sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the american people actually matter more than your short-term politics. they actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. and there have been a number of times where, as president of the united states, i've had to do things that i knew were bad politics but i understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.
fresh air weekend highlights some of the best interviews and reviews from past weeks, and new program elements specially paced for weekends. our weekend show emphasizes interviews with writers, filmmakers, actors and musicians, and often includes excerpts from live in-studio concerts. this week:
the south carolina primary for democrats will be the first significant measure of african-american voters in a state. eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the democratic electorate in the state. polls have shown that's a demographic sanders, the vermont independent, has struggled with compared to clinton. but coming off strong performances in iowa and new hampshire, and closing the gap with clinton nationally, sanders could well be competitive.
nathan guttman, a reporter with forward, an online news site aimed at jewish americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. he recounted watching as spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of charlottesville, michael signer.
simon: what's the essential detail here - when the payments were made, who made them or why? and can you ever really determine why?
bill kurtis: from npr and wbez chicago, this is wait wait... don't tell me, the npr news quiz. i'm bill kurtis. we are playing this week with mo rocca, amy dickinson and peter grosz. and here again is your host at the providence performing arts center in providence, r.i., peter sagal.
gross: so not only did playtone, your production company, come out of that thing you do - the title came out of it, too - because in that thing you do - it's a movie about a band. and you play an a&r guy from a record label who signs the band and tries to kind of bring them into the big time. and how did you come up with playtone? you wrote the script.
women taking care of everything during extraordinary circumstances is nothing new. right? we've been doing this since the beginning of time. this is just a different iteration of it. and so, you know, every woman that i know right now is juggling work, relationships, home, her own anxiety, her own fear, which is what we do every day.
the commission chairman at the time, martin r. castro, went further with a statement of his own, saying, the phrases 'religious liberty' and 'religious freedom' will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, islamophobia, christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.
brought to new york by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-soviet russia, observing the rise of the former kgb officer who now holds that nation's highest office.
cornish: ok. we'll be leaning on your expertise for sure. but first, i want to start with you, sam. you've been talking about love in the time of covid a lot on your show, right?
wine-banks: it didn't, and john dean had told us it didn't. so we knew that it didn't say that. but again, when you listen to it and you're waiting for those words and they don't come, you not only know that bob haldeman committed perjury, but you also know that the president was part of a conspiracy to pay hush money. and it proves your case in a way that almost nothing else could have done.

mallory mitchell: when you look at alabama's largest cities - birmingham, montgomery, mobile and huntsville - they all have very different histories and demographics. of all four, birmingham is the one city that seems progressive enough to elect a young black man to the office of mayor. however, that looks like it might be changing. what makes birmingham different from other large cities in the state?
brennan: i - yeah, i get it and i love it.
you know, the relationship between your parents, as described in the book, is just fascinating. these are two really interesting people, and this is a very intimate portrait of them - their courtship, their marriage - involving events that were, in many cases, before you were born. and i know you did lots of interviews. i'm wondering what it was like to kind of get in your parents' heads, your parents-in-their-20s' heads, and kind of - almost, like, kind of reconstructing a 360-degree view of your early life a little at a time.
bodden: neal, was that the plot behind the whole special?
davies: which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?
and so, you're right, nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following supreme court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. but people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. and this becomes i think a symbol of a process that, if republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're democrats or republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the senate.
donna: we did. we were married in 1983. and daddy died in 2006.

it's a much different political reality in colorado where the state's new democratic attorney general phil weiser will defend the state against phillips.
if great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. in charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. and the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. what do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? what do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? what do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? these questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. but the questions intensify.
you know, eventually, the special counsel's office asks for 64 more tapes, and there's a battle that goes all the way to the supreme court. and eventually, the court rules that they must be turned over. and that meant that you and the special counsel's office got the tapes. you could hear them themselves.
sagal: and we do hope that cats are listening because a short while ago with special guest panelist rosie perez, we featured a bluff the listener game about cats.
i just wish that he would kinda get a little bit thicker skin and get on with what he's got to do, said meyer. he's got a job to do, you know? he's got all of us looking up to him with hopeful eyes thinking that he's going to be not our savior, but that he's going to get where we need to be and on the right track again.
the battle between the two sides, the state and phillips, eventually landed in the high court.
it was really striking, you know, the weight loss and the way that it transformed how people carried themselves. suddenly, a young man would be using a walker. it was terrible. and then people started to disappear. as a child, i only understood so much, you know? as the years passed, i came to understand what was going on. and people began to disappear from our lives.
siegel: npr's nina totenberg, thank you.
after she learned on social media that her family had disowned her, alqunun said she'd like to drop her family name and go by rahaf mohammed, the toronto star reports. it's her latest show of defiance against a family she says abused her, in a country that forces women to get a man's permission to travel or marry. relieved to leave that culture behind, she hopes to galvanize others to do the same.
and i said, well, what's the difference? and you know what the difference was between the two of them? infection. and i thought, so let me get this straight, this isn't just about the fact that an ied took off your limbs and almost killed you. it's about that same ied picked up germs and microbes from the dirt and the dust of afghanistan or iraq, and put it so deep inside you that your body is now fighting centuries-old infections that still might kill you because we haven't figured out a way in order to make - itself infection-free.
ted shaw: that certainly is in question. and i guess that transgender people would say that they don't really choose their gender, that their gender is a matter of both biology but some other matters that go beyond genitalia. but that's - yeah, that's at the core of this confrontation.

phillips said the message about sex and gender identity conflicted with his christian religious beliefs.
volz: my mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. and so in the early days of sticky fingers, this meant that i went on brownie runs with her. first, she had me in a front carrier, then on a gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. and she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.
she's a social worker, so her first reaction was, good! therapy's a good thing. she wanted me to be happy, but she also felt, once it became clear that transition was coming right ahead, that she had a dilemma where she had to think: i have to help the person that i love most in the world at this moment of their crisis. but in so doing, i might lose the person that i love. it's kind of an unsolvable dilemma. and, yet, here we are still together, after 32 years of marriage — 12 as husband and wife, and 20 as wife and wife.

brian barfield has felt forgotten for years:
hanks: that literally comes in like they know it on the weather. they say tomorrow there will be a sandstorm that will last for 18 hours. and, sure enough, in the morning, there is a thick orange cloud, and there is the finest particles of sand, more like chalk or flour that seeps in through every crack in the window and underneath every door sill. i went back to my hotel room. we were shooting out in the middle of the desert near a place called tan-tan, morocco, but we were very much out in - as deserty as you could possibly ask for. everything in my room was covered with a fine layer of golden slash orange grit, so that wreaked havoc with some of the eyeballs of the crew and some of the sprockets of the machinery.
npr first profiled trotter, meyer, the barfields and two others in the st. louis area in 2011 as part of a long-term project called the road back to work. for a year, they kept audio diaries documenting their quest for employment. there were successes and failures, health scares and relationship troubles, jobs secured and lost.

gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words immigrant and refugee (both relatively sympathetic terms for most americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as migrant or invasion.
davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with writer alia volz. she has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in san francisco in the 1970s. it also deals with volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in san francisco in the period. the book is called home baked.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) a play, yes. a straight play?
liotta: that's it - didn't talk about it at all. as a matter of fact, i'm pretty sure they told me - i did - for show-and-tell in kindergarten, i told people the story that i was adopted. it never came up. it never really bothered me. i mean, the only time it would bother me with my parents is - on saturdays, they used to make us clean - you know, clean the house and vacuum and do chores. and i would never forget saying, the only reason why you adopted us was to do all this work. so it never really bothered me and i never really thought about it that much.
her daughter is named malia and was born shortly after president obama won in 2008, though trotter and her boyfriend picked the name before they knew one of obama's daughters was also named malia.
now, that's a huge burden of command, and it's something that you have to fight and tamp down, and you can't even begin - you can't allow yourself a moment of hesitation. and that faith in oneself is a very - that's the difference between success and failure, and it's not easy to do. and all of these guys have some degree of accomplishment, but it's been learned and earned at the same time. you know, no one is made a captain of a cargo ship without, you know - without an extraordinary amount of experience behind them. and that brand of of terror or loss of your own self-confidence, look - that's something that everybody goes through at some point. i have - my life has never been in jeopardy ever once.
volz: no. and i know that seems strange. but it was something that i learned so young that i don't have a specific memory about it. it was always who we are. so i had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.

transcript and video: president obama's interview with npr's nina totenberg
brian barfield: i want him to come out and say, 'here's what i've done. that was the start folks. and here's what i am going to do. i'm going to put hillary behind bars. i'm gonna build up our military. i'm going to make sure that wall gets built and mexico will pay.' ... everything he said in his campaign, just keep going right with it.
liotta: and i ended up in the hospital.
volz: no, but she found out. so apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. he just had to get it off his chest. and i think that she told my mom. and then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. so my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. this wasn't something i was told about as a kid. but i think as a teenager - was when i found out. and it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.
greene: ok. so now to the actors - and i mean, as we know, one of the things oscar has been criticized for for a long time is lack of diversity. what are we looking at this year?
within hours of the tragedy in charlottesville, journalists, scholars and other leading voices weighed in around the internet, with analysis and deeper understanding of how this unfolded.
hanks: the story that has to come out, now, is all of what you're talking about. that yes, of - i've talked to guys with missing limbs, and i visited with a bunch of wounded guys a while back. and there was two guys that had lost limbs, and they were still in wheelchairs. one guy was going to be in the hospital for probably about another three years, missing two arms and - two legs and an arm. and i was talking to another fellow who was in the same condition, suffered the same wounds, but he was going to be getting out in a couple of weeks.
sagal: here then are your choices of the cats in the news. was it, from amy dickinson, how the wrong cat litter led to a nuclear meltdown at a nuclear waste facility; from rosie perez, how somebody annoyed with cat litter on his floor came up with a business for cat manicures, pedicures and other salon services in new york; or from adam felber, how the hero cat of youtube turns out to be an unreconstructed racist?
under the first amendment to the u.s. constitution, congress is barred from enacting an establishment of religion, but neither can it prohibit the free exercise thereof. the question under current debate is what it means to exercise one's religion.
when the conversation doesn't include you: lgbtq+ sex ed in a small town
hanks: and you don't know his name. and i just thought, well, that is a brand of serendipity that might be the backbone in order to put into this movie that i wanted to make that was about music, that was about growing up. so what happens in that thing you do! is guy patterson has to replace the drummer in the wonders because he broke his arm. and it's because of that serendipity, that circumstance, that he ends up having six of the greatest months of his life. so it was taking something that had happened in real life and turning it to my own devices.
mcevers: her name is denise peraza, is that right?
christina aguilera: come on. come on. yeah. (vocalizing). come on. come on.
volz: ok. so this is kind of, i want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. although, i think my parents would disagree. but my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the i ching, which is a 4,000-year-old chinese divination method rooted in daoism and confucianism. and you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. and my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.
(soundbite of guy van duser's viper's drag)
i have a boy and two girls — until they tell me otherwise — and my son had a bunch of friends over and i walked into the room and i said to them, is anybody hungry? and all the boys answered, yes, without taking their eyes off the tv. the girls said nothing, took their eyes off the tv and started looking at each other's faces. and i'll never forget it, because i thought: oh, we girls, in every moment of uncertainty are trained not to look inside themselves, but to look outside of themselves for approval, for permission, for consensus. ... a girl who at 10 years old can't tell you if she's hungry or not, becomes a woman at 40 years old who is still asking her friends if they approve of the person she's dating. ...there's decisions that we can make as a community that we can call our friends about. and there are decisions that can only be made by going inward and deciding for ourselves. because in the end, when we're talking about our lives, there's no map. right? we're all pioneers.

woodfin: two worlds. i would say what's similar is people have high demands and high requests and a lot of issues and concerns for whatever level you represent people. they come directly to you. they want you to fix something, solve something, address something. so that's similar, but different in this - in the fact that this is the largest city in the state of alabama. so there are many and multiple issues that i am tasked with and responsible for addressing. i want to address - hopefully, my city councilors don't get mad. but i will definitely say my brothers at morehouse.

amy dickinson: alvin bar hit the jackpot recently when he brought a ceramic jug to antiques roadshow to be appraised. alvin came away with shocking knowledge that his $300 ugly face jug was worth $50,000. the grotesque-style pottery which looks like a cross between a gargoyle and nick nolte's mugshot, was described by the show's appraiser as bizarre and wonderful and about 100 years old. after the jug was appraised, alvin bar, its owner, reacted like he went to bed with phyllis diller and woke up with beyonce.

brian barfield, 59, has long considered himself a conservative, a reagan republican, and he jokes that his wife is liberal. jennifer barfield, 53, did vote for president obama in 2012, a choice she made after he approved the raid that killed osama bin ladin, but she bristles at her husband's description.

but my relationship with the i ching as a kid was that i trusted it. and the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. so i sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. and yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because i trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. and i trusted the i ching then. it was later, more as a teenager, that i was like, oh, no. wait. science (laughter), you know? and i started to rebel more against the idea. but it's really only as an adult that i look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid i was.
pifer: yeah - well, i had a feeling when he didn't pick up. but when it went straight to voicemail...
so did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that republicans really do like him?
meraji: mayor woodfin, you've got to take this first.
david letterman. so it's a very weird, wild story. i found out i had four birth half-sisters, a half-brother and a full sister - things i didn't know. and i'm 44 years old, so i didn't know any of this stuff.
meraji: she's actually from staten island.
sagal: did you just say father of four cats?
gross: and they're at this turning point of their lives 'cause they're teenagers entering adulthood or maybe college or maybe the military and maybe fame. and, like, you don't know, through most of the movie, which direction this is going to go in. and you're the person who's kind of, like, experienced in it. you're the a&r guy. so why did you choose to do it from the point of view as a band? i assume you love music, in part because of this movie and also, like, your company has produced the telecasts of the rock and roll hall of fame inductions.
and she also - i had asked her about precautions that she had taken to avoid erasing. and she basically screamed at me, well, i used my head. it's the only thing i had to use. and it turned out that wasn't very effective, obviously, because the mistake was made. and when she finally was called the second time to testify, i had to give her her miranda warnings, which is something that lawyers seldom ever do. but she was now a suspect in a criminal investigation, and so i had to do it before i could ask her any questions.
kurtis: you know, not many people get all three right, but neal brennan did. congratulations, neal.

we went to church. church on sundays was, like, two hours. bible school was a very prescribed thing. dinnertime was the parson coming over with - and he would - parson, would you do the honor of us asking the blessing? my sister and my brother and i would roll our eyes because that'd mean that guy was going to talk for 40 minutes. you know, he'd have his head bowed and the operatic voice would come out. dear heavenly father, we ask bountiful blessings on the hanks family. here we are. he would talk for - and eyes closed, the food's getting cold, we're all hungry. we didn't quite really understand what was going on.

wine-banks: no, you don't. you just smile and stand there, all the blood draining from your face and in total horror. i mean, it was very hard to be the first. and i always felt that as the first, if i screwed up that i was going to make it harder for anyone to follow me. it would be easy for someone to say, well, women just can't do it. and so i really felt that pressure to perform well so that other women could follow me.

so the scene down at fisherman's wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. there were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. and there was a busking scene of people like robin williams and penn and teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the new vaudeville.

one of the reasons it is so hard to find our inner voice is because the voices outside of us are so loud. over time, we have lived more and more of an exterior life. right? we are always looking at our phones. we are always listening to the tv. we are always listening to outer voices. and so one of the things that changed my life is a practice of spending a few minutes a day just with no other voices, and just listening. getting back in touch with the inner voice ... i do not think that everyone needs to leave their husband and marry a female olympian — although i highly recommend it — but what i do think is that everyone needs to practice honoring that inner voice.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross. we're listening to my interview with writer alia volz. her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in san francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. volz's book is home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco.

felber: remember smudge, the hero cat who was caught on video saving his toddler friend from a vicious dog a couple of weeks ago? of course you do. more than 130 million people watched it on youtube. well, the happy story has kind of a sour coda because in addition to being a hero, it now turns out that smudge is a huge racist.
so she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. and we'd go from business to business. and her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. so i was very little. obviously, i don't remember much clearly from this period. but i do have these flashes of memory. and there's a certain feeling that comes to me when i think of it. it was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the castro, where my mom was mostly working. and there was, i think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that i get, anyway.

we can't use equality to just wipe out one of the [first amendment] rights, carlson-thies says, or say you can have the right, as long as you just exercise it in church, but not out in life.
woodfin: that's a really good answer.
davies: now, what's interesting, you initially request - i think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. and this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as i read this. it helped in asking for specific dates to have white house logs, which you had been provided by whom?

what he wants to hear: i would like to see him remain calm, and not go off on a tangent, and focus — focus on the problems at hand and what he's done so far and what he hopes to accomplish. i want him to get up there and act presidential and look presidential and don't pass buck and don't start slamming anybody and just tell it like it is. ... i want to hear what he thinks he's accomplished. and i don't need him to necessarily be optimistic, to sugar-coat it, but tell me what you really are doing. tell me what progress he's seen, real progress he's seen. i would like to see some hard mechanics.

so for - you know, my mom had the first really high-volume delivery service. now you can use an app to summon a company like eaze and a complete stranger will show up to your door with a lanyard. you don't exchange more than five words, and you pay for it with a debit card. the community aspect has completely run out of the process. the current canna-business (ph) laws are also extremely harmful to small farmers, who were the ones who kept this all going during the '70s and '80s. so some of the changes have really stripped the community-building feelings out of it. at the same time, i'm glad that people have access, especially those who use it for medicinal purposes.

woodfin: but should there be term limits? yes.

while both cases make their way through lower courts, both sides anticipate the high court taking the issue up again — for the sake of clarity.

then on february 11 of 1964, the beatles were on television, and it all went away before the first commercial break of the ed sullivan show. to see these guys on tv, in which everybody on the planet stopped what they were doing in order watch it, 1964 became, i think, the most joyous year of my life. and it was all because of them and everything that followed. so when i began having these stories rattle around inside my head, i selfishly wanted to recreate that same joy that i experienced as a 7-year-old kid in february and march and april and the entire summer of 1964.

and my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. i'm not demanding that republicans vote for merrick garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. and at some point, it's got to stop.

but he would have these grand mal seizures. and sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. but i find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. and some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. so i don't know if my dad might be in that category. in any case, it was a strong force in his life.

cornish: now, staying with the theme of keeping a relationship exciting, our next question comes from someone in a long-distance relationship. clark is from new york. he asked that we use his first name only because his question has to do with sex. now, he lives a few hours away from his girlfriend. they just started dating. and they're only able to see each other once a month.

wine-banks: yes, although in the watergate case, there were a lot more complications. at first, he said, this is a hoax in a witch hunt, which sounds dramatically familiar to listeners today. he also simply refused. he just said, i'm not turning them over. eventually we went public. archibald cox, who was the special prosecutor, had a press conference and, in a very moving and dramatic and - full of integrity, said why we needed the tapes and why we had a legal right to have them, which led to the president ordering the attorney general to fire archibald cox.

carlson-thies is one of several conservatives who support a fairness for all initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for lgbt rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. the lgbt community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection.

as much as whodunits, farhadi makes what-done-its and why-done-its. the director has a detached, rather clinical style, as if he's photographing specimens in a terrarium, the terrarium being a city in which artists have to watch their backs because of hovering sensors. his own social criticisms are oblique. the movie begins with the imminent collapse of rana and emad's lovely apartment, a literal collapse, the result of apparently careless citywide construction.

clinton also led in south carolina in 2008, but those leads evaporated once barack obama proved he could win in lily-white iowa. he not only carried the black vote 78 percent to 19 percent over clinton, but he also won with women (also a majority) and young voters. sanders has been beating clinton by huge margins with young voters, and even won women in new hampshire.
wine-banks: rose mary woods was basically thrown under the bus by the white house counsel. they said we have now discovered as part of the drip, drip, drip of bad news - after the hearing on the first two missing tapes, they came back on the day before thanksgiving and said, whoops (ph), there is a problem in a third tape. there's an 18 1/2-minute gap, and only rose mary woods can explain it. and we can find no innocent explanation for it, which was really a dramatic announcement. and i had cross-examined her when she first testified about the two missing tapes as basically just a chain of custody witness because she had handled them.
sagal: emmanuel macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. and he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when france was great. all true. he's just like donald trump, except macron can speak better english.
haslam last week vetoed a proposal to make the bible the official state book. he told npr it trivializes the bible. he also successfully urged lawmakers to withdraw a so-called bathroom bill, tennessee's version of legislation that would require students to use restrooms according to their gender assigned at birth rather than one that matches the gender with which they identify. north carolina and mississippi have both approved such laws amid widespread criticism.
so i had to rely on ollie atkins, who was the president's white house photographer. and the pictures are dramatic proof that her story didn't hold up. she also, just to make it clear, she said she had to make two mistakes. she had to push the wrong button and keep her foot on the pedal, which was a physical impossibility, certainly for 18 minutes. you might have been able to do it for one second but not for any prolonged period of time. so it just wasn't possible.
gross: (laughter) is that a good thing or a bad thing?
these parents formed a group called cast — conservatives of allendale stand together. in a 29-page complaint to the school board, they accused liberals of trying to indoctrinate their kids with radical sexual ideology. they demanded that the district ban any mention of lgbtq+ issues in sex ed — or any other class. not only that, they also called on the superintendent to throw out a reference to queer and trans kids in the school district's anti-bullying campaign.
meraji: so you ask a clarifying question.
brennan: i'm - i don't think you can sue for microaggressions even in canada. so...
well, first of all, if you look at what joe biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a supreme court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.
demby: where does mayor randall woodfin turn up?
gross: i wonder if it's, like, a rite of passage, like an initiation thing into manhood, where fathers sit down their sons and go, son, you're old enough now to see goodfellas. it's a great film.
in that space of time where my calendar was empty, i decided: why don't i go and kind of double down on my own projects? i had been working on sleepwalk with me, the one-person show, for seven years as sort of a side project. and i was like: why don't i produce that with the level of production that these networks and studios bring to their movies and tv shows? so that's when i mounted sleepwalk with me off-broadway. since then, i've made three off-broadway shows and directed two movies, and i feel actually so happy for that failure. i feel like that sitcom not being picked up is financially the worst thing that ever happened in my life, and artistically the best.
the program has its critics. some say the diversity visas could better be used to reduce the current backlog of people who have been waiting many years to enter this country.
cornish: you should have just brought your questions.
anonymous calls from people allegedly offended by his comments also began pouring into his department's office phone. online trolls heaped abuse upon shi on wechat and another popular social platform, weibo. shi was eventually fired in july 2017 from his position as assistant professor of classical chinese at beijing normal university.
it was copeland who got treadwell diagnosed with schizophrenia. over and over, she's tried to get him into new hampshire's state mental hospital, and failed. even a judge's order couldn't get him from jail to the hospital.
i think, in 2018, when i fast forward and there have been so many stories - when you think about the four little girls, there was a fifth girl that survived, sarah. and when i think about her, she is the definition of reconciliation, where she spoke recently - there was a re-enactment of the children's crusade, the march. and she spoke in front of an audience, but the majority of the room was full of children. and she spoke of forgiveness and forgiving to what happened to her, what happened to her sister, what happened to her friends. and i think if i had a tangible example to give of just what reconciliation means, she embodies that.
woodfin: i've been paying attention to other cities. in 2018, you can't call d.c. chocolate city anymore. hot atlanta. we've seen the changes there. and then, you see it even in a city like austin. i think for birmingham, watching other cities - what can we do? a city made up of 99 neighborhoods, where 88 of them are all black, 11 are majority white.
i got captain dale dye, who was our adviser, took myself and mykelti williamson and gary sinise, and we went off and we toured parris island. and i saw guys who were probably anywhere from 12 to 15 years younger than me going through their boot camp. and it is hot, and they are miserable. and they're getting yelled at, and they look like they're scared and exhausted.
woodfin: and, of course, food always comes up.
hanks: i get this question a lot because, yeah, i - not only do i go to it in my work, but i also read about it constantly, about the war and the war years - is because when i was a kid - i grew up in alameda, calif. i spent a lot of years there.
in the middle of the night, my mom wakes up and the bed is shaking like crazy. here we are in san francisco. she thinks it's an earthquake. she sits up, realizes that nothing else in the room is moving, that it's doug shaking wildly in bed, and she thought he might be having a drug overdose. but then he stopped and was sleeping calmly. and it wasn't until weeks later that he told her he had grand mal epilepsy, and he'd had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the night.
donald trump unveils new, more diverse supreme court short list
jenna ellis, an evangelical attorney and adviser to trump's 2020 campaign, said she would like to see democrats engage in a public conversation about faith. but she doesn't think many conservative white evangelicals would be won over.

i enjoyed it, nina. thank you.
but it was around. it was so much a part of the environment that it would be unreasonable to assume that i didn't inhale it as secondhand smoke. and of course, the brownies taste like chocolate, so i'm sure i snuck some. but it's not like i was - you know, it's not like my parents were feeding me pot brownies. i want to be really clear about that. where i think it might be more damaging is with the harder drugs. cocaine is a substance that alters one's personality in a fairly significant way. so there's that. but i also want to say that all of the kids growing up in the sticky fingers warehouse came out just fine. we're all responsible adults and contributors to society. so...
iowa was tailored for a christian-conservative candidate, like texas sen. ted cruz, and new hampshire gave a jolt to centrist, establishment figures like kasich, the ohio governor, and it solidified trump's dominance across the board. in south carolina, all of those elements combine.

getting to rub shoulders with all of these great chefs, from thomas keller to daniel boulud to jacques pepin and on and on, it does inform my thinking about food — i mean, how could it not? but our show is really about professional chefs who command a kitchen that puts out 200 plates of food that are all different, and hot, and come out at the same time. but, you know, it has informed me immensely. i would consider myself a culinary spelunker, and i love nothing more than to go to a new town or city, and discover that city through its food.
gross: because records were starting to be opened about that.
mo rocca: when wendy schleicher of ottawa, canada, turned 50, her family and friends knew where to take her - to a place where she could ski, eat the world's best chocolates and buy a cuckoo clock, all things wendy loves. so they chartered a jet to switzerland, except that the pilot must've misheard. when we landed, i thought, switzerland doesn't have elephants and rhinos, said wendy. that's when i discovered we were in swaziland.
i just wanted them to understand that i'm a normal person, she says. i want to be treated just the same as everybody else. i want to get some job, and i want to be seen as just the register lady or something, you know what i'm sayin'? i don't wanna be looked at as 'oh, the trans girl.' i just wanna be me.
here at code switch, my teammate gene demby wrote about about how white nationalists are edging their movement out of the shadows:
sagal: if you are a man - and i know some of you are - and you're finding it hard to understand why this is so offensive to women, just imagine going into the shaving cream aisle where they have those tubes of shaving cream. and imagine that in order to represent different kinds of men, all the cans are different lengths.
no, i didn't say you had.
del barco: right. that's right. honeyland, the film from north macedonia, is about a woman in the mountains who is keeping the tradition of beekeeping for honey alive. and in that very competitive international feature category, honeyland will go up against france's les miserables, spain's pain and glory, poland's corpus christi. and perhaps the biggest competition will come from south korea's parasite, which earned a total of six nominations.

while the family won in a district court, the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit dismissed the case in 2016, saying the browns faced no credible fear of future prosecution because local prosecutors had adopted a policy of not prosecuting cases in the absence of additional crimes.

michael gerson, a former speechwriter for president george w. bush, lambasted trump in a washington post piece, writing that the current president was incapable of speaking for the nation in the face of tragedy:
gross: you had an aunt who was a nazarene. did you try all those religions yourself?
davies: on today's show, we conclude this week's series of favorite recent interviews with ray liotta, who starred in martin scorsese's classic 1990 film goodfellas. he played henry hill, a wise guy, a member of a new york crime family who testified against the family after he was arrested and went into the witness protection program.
they recently invited us into their home on a cold night, to talk about what's been going on in town. the vanderhelms say for them, this conversation is shaped by their faith. i come from a biblical worldview, says kim. we were just, as you guys pulled up, we were reading the bible together as devotions. so we do not believe god created people to have these desires.
what would challenge us financially more is if enrollment is hurt, he says. if we have fewer students seeking ordination in the united methodist church, that affects us financially as well. we are living in some pretty serious tension right now.

hanks plays alan clay, a middle-aged american businessman who's sent to saudi arabia where the king is planning to build a new city in the middle of the desert. clay's job is to convince the saudis to let the company he works for provide new state of the art it technology and support for this new city. in this scene, he shows up at the desert location to find his it team is being housed in a large tent with no food, spotty wi-fi and no one to complain to.
and i think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. and he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.
the bill is part of a widespread reaction to the national focus on same-sex marriage and transgender rights. the state's governor is the latest chief executive to be placed at the center of that national debate.
davies: yeah. does he still have seizures today?

there are still some holdouts. for example, east china normal university and wuhan university — which have joint-venture campuses in the shanghai area with new york university and duke university, respectively — have not amended their charters, which still contain commitments to academic freedom.
neal brennan: there are three mics on stage, just, like, mics on stands, and they're just basically spaced out. like, they each have, like, a little area. and i just go from one mic to the other. i basically do, like, 10 minutes of stand-up, then 10 minutes of, like, more emotional honesty, i guess, and then, like, two minutes of one-liners. and then i just repeat.
i can't speak for all the [united methodist] schools, but one thing we've learned is that we have students who are struggling right now with their church, says rundell of the methodist theology school in ohio. for our younger students in particular, [lgbtq equality] is a matter that, in most of their lives, is no longer debated.
at 61 years old, ray meyer has worked in banking for some 40 years, except for the three-year gap where he struggled to find any work at all. in january 2009, the bank where he had worked for five years laid off more than a third of its staff.
pesci: (as tommy devito) whoa, whoa, anthony, he's a big boy. he knows what he said. what'd you say, funny how?
the barfields, both trump supporters, want to hear more of what he's already promised. annica trotter didn't vote for trump; she wants to hear humility from the president. ray meyer, who has mixed feelings about trump, is looking for a measured address with hard evidence.
woodfin: they're going to be harder than yours?
and the alameda naval air station meant that most of my friends were in the navy, their dads were in the navy, their parents were dealing with that. and this was during vietnam, so i had - my schoolmates all had dads on the uss ranger and the iwo jima and the enterprise, aircraft carriers and what have you. and they were all in the gulf of tonkin, and they were flying missions in this war that was going on.
the idea of having sex as a trans person is weird because your brain is disconnected from your physical body, she explains. so when you look at your body, you don't want this, you know? so the idea of having sex in this body is hard ... because maybe i'll just look down and see this disgusting body of mine and cry or something, you know?
it's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, tooley says. so if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. so in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.
it did make a big difference, though, in terms of acceptance of what we were doing because you had a public disclosure of information so that the american public could hear john dean testify. and i have to say at the time when he testified, he had no notes because he had been escorted out of the white house and had left without his diaries and messages. so he testified from memory.
klein: that's exactly what i mean.
and if it wasn't for buckets, i probably would've left. but i came back the next year. and i ended up going the whole four years. but during those four years, i graduated to doing riff in west side story and just different musicals. so to answer your question, yes, i had sang before.

david edelstein, byline: a woman is brutally assaulted in the early part of asghar farhadi's gripping iranian drama the salesman. the woman, rana, is washing up in the bathroom of her new apartment in an unfamiliar part of tehran, just home from acting in arthur miller's death of a salesman, where she plays willy loman's wife. she hears the buzzer from downstairs and thinks it's her husband, emad, who plays willy. so she unlocks the door and returns to what she was doing.

peter grosz: dr. vincent benjamin of palm springs, calif., is one of america's leading experts in the kama sutra, the ancient indian book containing dozens of creative sexual poses with names like the eagle, the bridge and bandolier. but the kama sutra isn't just sexy twister. it can be a way for couples to rekindle the dormant flames of their marriage, which is why this week dr. benjamin sold out the symposium he hosts at the sheridan in indio, calif., entitled more bang for your buck, spicing up your love life for only $50.

liotta: you go up and down (laughter) - probably with your feet.
as the news was breaking of the directive from yates, trump senior policy adviser stephen miller told msnbc's greta van susteren that yates' decision was a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.
liotta: no, man, she had cash.
but can you blame the republicans who look at this nomination and say, there's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. so can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. and if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the democrats do the same? they called — they're all already calling it the biden rule.

russian-american masha gessen sees putin in trump, trouble in future
shaw: well, when i wrote that, what i meant was that i was focused on the battles on behalf of african-americans. over time, as a civil rights lawyer, i came to realize that we have to be opposed to the subordination of people because of who and what they are, even if we're not part of that group. but i simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. it should be wrong. it's a matter of law. and i think as a country, we've been growing in our understanding of our values and principles with respect to discrimination and how we treat our fellow citizens and how we want to be treated ourselves, all of us, whether it's on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, our religion, on and on. it's just growth.
gross: you're an overgrown boy in that.

philpott: but this member of the fourth generation of the bush political dynasty hasn't quite lived up to the expectations. there are questions about how well his office has handled hurricane harvey relief. even worse, he's received bad press over his handling of the alamo - you know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. so facing an unexpectedly tough primary, george p. bush has sought out the most coveted endorsement in republican politics.

meraji: welcoming cities - what do you mean by that? what's the discrepancy between the two things because you were talking about there's these two things?
this kind of struggle is playing out in communities across the country. in a recent national survey by the nonprofit glsen, less than 1 in 10 lgbtq+ students said they received sex ed that was inclusive of their identities. in some places, laws expressly prohibit teachers from discussing lgbtq+ people or topics in a positive way — in other words, promoting homosexuality. activists commonly refer to these as no promo homo laws.

boylan acknowledges that some in the trans community might take issue with the notion that she had a boyhood.
pifer: yeah, you know, sometimes i have gone out. and you know what? it's - it was - the first time wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be because i'm not going to hijack their experience with my own experience. i just know that they have a long road ahead of them, the people we respond to. and keeping them safe in the moments after the horrible accident is really helping me heal, to an extent. it's giving back. and it's a huge word, people were dropping it. i didn't agree at first. but i think it's destiny now.
colonialism is a real thing. but i also want to point out, having talked to several of my friends in africa, that not all africans agree with this decision, she says. i think it's unfair for americans to blame africa or south america or the philippines for this decision.
equality for all is something that we here in colorado are committed to, the laws will be enforced, weiser said. we will just have to play a few more innings before we win this game.
lisa garaya: when i came to college, i learned about various theories surrounding race such as microaggressions and power dynamics. these are words that i had obviously never heard, but i began to feel like these examples of casual racism hit a little too close to home. for example, growing up, it was a pretty normal occurrence to be asked what kind of indian i was - red dot or feather. i thought back on how time after time my white peers made me feel uncomfortable with their comments about my racial background, except at the time they were saying it, i didn't know why i was uncomfortable. learning about microaggressions provided clarity but also introduced a lot of anger in my life. it's frustrating. do any other people of color who go through this epiphany feel this way? how do you decompress your past with this new outlook on it?
unidentified actor: (as character) why are you here? can you - can you understand us?
greene: now the state of north carolina is basically accusing the obama administration of trying to rewrite laws, suggesting that this should be left to congress and that the obama administration has an agenda here that they're trying to put forth. i mean, does the state have an argument there?
i thought that i would be able to at least make enough money to make the payments, which wasn't true at all, she says.

philpott: grandson to president number 41, nephew to number 43 and son to jeb bush, the former florida governor and presidential candidate. that's a lot to live up to, but it was a mantle that, southern methodist university political science professor cal jillson says, george p. appeared ready to take up.
at the courthouse, he pleads guilty to public urination. he says he didn't think life would be like this when he was younger.
kelli barrett: (singing) don't dab your eye, mein herr, or wonder why, mein herr. i've always said that i was a rover. you mustn't knit your brow. you should've known by now...
but i think the same cohort of people now, who are 22 and 23 - they want to stay here. and so it's good to see our city be a part of the national trend of people wanting to be in the urban core in the central city. with that, that's bringing a whole new flavor of young people and new people, i think, from a governing standpoint. people want their municipal government to reflect the same thing we're seeing in the private sector. they want it to reflect the same thing they're seeing on the social scene, which is something new. and that's what our candidacy and campaign represented.

davies: right. so she ends up giving this explanation of - and people who remember watergate will remember this - that it seems the only way she could have erased this, she said the phone rang and she went to pick up the phone but somehow kept her foot on a pedal that was connected to the recording. and then that's what caused the erasure. but what's remarkable about this is that she says, well, it was different in my - when you made a comment about that's awkward, and she says, well, it's different in my office.
annica trotter, 31, was the youngest person we met in 2011. and she doesn't just have a job six years later, she has a career. she is working overnights as a registered nurse, making a difference in people's lives one shift at a time.
their position is completely hypocritical to what it actually means to be a christian, she said. if they're reaching out to evangelicals and saying, 'i am a christian, but i support gay marriage; i am a christian, but i support abortion,' that's being hypocritical.

when it comes to the supreme court, i've appointed two women, one hispanic. and in each case, the good news is that i appointed the person who i absolutely thought was the best person for the job. in this case, merrick garland is the best person for the job.
hanks: ...like, went with the flow, and we moved around an awful lot. and, by the time i was 10 - i was actually kind of proud of this, as a matter of fact - by the time i was 10, i had lived in 10 different houses.
if they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from russia or they're going to buy it from china or they're going to buy it from other countries, trump said at a news conference on saturday. from the standpoint of jobs, economic development, a lot of other reasons, i would like to do something where we could maybe look at other things [than canceling the deal].
nondiscrimination is a great american principle — it's a core american principle — as is religious freedom, haynes says. when you have two important american principles coming into tension, into conflict with one another, our goal as americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.
this week, the trump administration weighed in on an important civil rights case heading to the u.s. supreme court. the u.s. justice department sided with a colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. to advocates in the lgbt community, it is just the latest disappointment from the trump administration. npr justice correspondent carrie johnson is here to tell us more. carrie, thanks so much for joining us.

richard spencer, the white nationalist leader and university of virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'if you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' spencer told the atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'by 2015, gay marriage is popular. what is possible has shifted. that's what the alt-right is doing. it's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.'
woodfin: i think sanctuary city is narrowly tailored and isolated towards don't have your police enforce certain things of rounding up and hurting people, which i agree with. we're not going to do that. but welcoming cities is more broad about, how do we help our immigrant community? and as i go to birmingham city schools, i can tell you our immigrant community continues to grow. so it's - for me it has a broader positive impact, whereas sanctuary is don't do this. welcoming is, this is what we're going to do.
trump: if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.
philpott: and a bush loss? well, that would have pundits across the country talking about the end of the bush political dynasty. still, it's a big family. for npr news, i'm ben philpott in austin.
this is fresh air. i'm tv critic david bianculli, sitting in for terry gross. today's show is dominated by song and dance. first up, we'll listen back to an archive interview with gwen verdon, the broadway actress and dancer who electrified audiences in everything from can-can and damn yankees to chicago. along with one of her husbands, choreographer and film director bob fosse, she's the subject of a new fx miniseries called fosse/verdon, which premieres next tuesday. let's begin with my review of fx's fosse/verdon.
meraji: you can check out ashley's work online at ashleymichellejones.wordpress.com. ashley's newest book is called dark//thing, and it's going to be out in february.
davies: you know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. and there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. you know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. what's your take on this? did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?
yet many economists say this younger generation will eventually be able to buy — just later than previous generations.
del barco: yes - it also earned nominations for costume design, cinematography and score. but david, it's worth noting - it's worth taking a closer look at that directing category. the nominees include martin scorsese for his gangster film the irishman, quentin tarantino for his nostalgic take on 1970s hollywood once upon a time in hollywood, sam mendes for his world war i film 1917 and south korean director bong joon-ho for parasite. and you'll notice, though, that not a single woman was nominated for directing. announcer issa rae quickly noted that after the category was read.
sagal: thank you so much for playing.
hanks: no. it was - it literally came down to this - just simple. there was only one way that it could economically work. my mom and dad - god bless them - you know, they were together for a while. but when it was (laughter) - when it was time for them to divide, boy, did they know it. they needed to break up, and they did.
president trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. the language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by republican sens. ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah called the first amendment defense act.

cornish: but dr. lexx brown-james, you've been seeing couples. what are you telling them?
their new shabbier apartment has items belonging to the evicted previous tenant and her small child, whose bike is still there. that tenant apparently had clients, meaning johns, and emad suspects the person who assaulted his wife might have been one or else was sent by the woman to harass the new tenants. when he finds a set of keys dropped by the attacker and the van parked nearby they belong to, emad wants vengeance. but rana is impossible to pin down.
clinton has been emphasizing her support in the african-american community, touting the endorsement of the congressional black caucus pac this week. civil rights icon and georgia rep. john lewis was dismissive of sanders, saying he had seen evidence of the clintons' work to gain equal rights but not sanders's.

she is worried about what that type of thinking could lead to. it's really sickening because when you have people in power that have those kinds of ideas it can be very dangerous for some and then eventually all, she said.
gross: but yeah, you played sinatra in the rat pack, the hbo movie, in which don cheadle was sammy davis jr.
the original story behind the masterpiece cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. the owner and master baker jack phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.
liotta: (as henry hill) just - you know, how you tell a story. what...
the measure did ultimately prevail. more than five years later, mahoney said the law has made a huge difference in the lives of lgbtq people.
liotta: to get better movie parts, to tell you the god's-honest truth. i - you know, i've been lucky enough to do and work in this business for years. but i wasn't getting the exact kind of parts that i wanted. usually, it wasn't about if i had the ability to do it. it was more about - did i have enough umph behind me to put butts in the seats or eyes on the tube? i just started seeing people's careers.
but in china, where officials are trying to get ahead of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, the date saw a surge of couples registering to wed, spurring the government to advise couples to postpone their weddings.
greene: when you say it's just growth, it makes me want to ask you if conversations around, you know, same-sex marriage that we've seen in recent years and the supreme court decision on that and the conversations around this law, i mean, are - as sensitive and infuriating as some of these conversations can be to some people on both sides, i mean, is there an argument that these conversations are just good for society to have as time evolves?
wine-banks: they did. they cried because they couldn't believe what they were hearing as they listened to this horrible series of conversations. and it's available to anyone who wants to listen through the national archives. you can listen to these tapes. and it's proof beyond doubt of the president's culpability.
davies: ...in a way, they had a place in the sort of recognition of the medical benefits of marijuana, didn't they?
'i'm living in the world with no secrets,' says trans activist jennifer finney boylan

klein: i mean, i think the red flagness (ph) is balanced out by the fact that you do present - and i mean this as a compliment - like, there's a wounded bird quality that i do think - i will say as a woman that i did also find appealing.
jennifer barfield is currently among the 4.8 percent officially counted as unemployed.
cal jillson: he was a young, vibrant, good-looking guy. so he looked like a central-casting, next-generation bush candidate starting in texas but with national possibilities.
klein: bill, how did neal do on our quiz?
now what is true, nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. justice scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. and so i understand the politics that republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.
hanks: i am a chrismated hellenic in the greek orthodox church. i do like, on occasion, going to sunday services. nothing is really expected of you in the greek orthodox church. you don't sing. you don't have hymnals. you might take part in some of the same choral chants that goes on. but i go, and i like to ponder the great questions of the universe when i go. and, i think, i embrace it as cleanly as i do because of the background that i had in all these other theologies that came at me.
i think the impact was profound, he said.
what i have seen are the public statements of leading republicans like orrin hatch broadly complimenting judge garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the supreme court.
the unemployment rate would rise to about 9.4 percent if those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons are added to those still looking for work.
sagal: this is terrible. andy, it is nice to have you with us. you're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction.
multiple gofundme campaigns have raised several thousand dollars to help alqunun start over. the official fundraising campaign quickly raised $10,000 and is no longer accepting money. there's also a campaign by the australian group secret sisterhood, which had protested in sydney to try to persuade australia to grant alqunun's refugee request. alqunun filled out her visa application at the australian embassy in bangkok last week, but the unhcr withdrew its request for resettlement there because the country was taking too long to decide on her asylum, abc reported.
johnson: sure. the owner of a colorado shop called masterpiece cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. and this baker, jack phillips, said no. he violated the statute on the books in colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his first amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. but the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.
dickinson: ...in the 1970s in bend, ore. sure enough, the original artist, betsy, verified that she had made it in ceramics class. so it's not 100 years old, and it's not worth $50,000. it's as old as your mom's crosby, stills, nash and young album and is worth a little more than $300. the antiques roadshow expert admitted his mistake, and the owner took the jug out from behind his couch. he said, i hated it when it was worth $50,000. who wants that lying around their house? now it's on my table, and i love it again.
brennan: i was trying to get more women to slide.
gross: david edelstein is film critic for new york magazine. tomorrow on fresh air, we'll talk about the trump administration's relationship with the alt-right and the divisions he's created in the christian right. our guest will be investigative journalist sarah posner. i hope you'll join us. i'm terry gross.
davies: you said - that was the story in your family. your mom didn't know it at the time, right?
but the artistic, creative process of one is still based on your ability to fight down those doubts of yourself, and you have to move forward. you have to move forward with a degree of confidence, and you cannot sweat too much the possibility that you are making a wrong mistake. it sounds almost like a paltry comparison to a lot of the characters that i've been able to play in these big movies, but, you know, that type of a battle of self-worth is something that everybody goes through at some point.
wine-banks: thank you. it's been a pleasure, dave.
brown-james: so one thing - and some people hate me for this, but i'm a go ahead and say it because i tell everybody to do that - i take sex off the table. so we can build up arousal, let's plan to do something funny every day. so we're laughing together. we're touching. let's look at just making out. kissing starts to decrease the longer that people are together, which are a million nerve endings that are not being tantalized on a regular basis. so let's just go for broke and have a make-out session midday for our, quote-unquote, lunch. and it doesn't have to go further than that.
but at the universities that have adopted pro-party charters, say academics interviewed by npr, the rule change encapsulates some of the difficulties that educators face in china.
well, sometimes i just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. you learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.
trump's election raises host of issues for supreme court
davies: all right, let's talk about the watergate case. one of the interesting things about this is that in may of '73, when the special counsel's office is organized and you begin this criminal investigation into nixon and his associates, the u.s. senate forms a committee and is beginning to hold public hearings on this. and a lot had come out on this because the watergate burglars - one of them, james mccord - had begun talking about the cover-up, in effect. what effect did it have to u.s. prosecutors to have these senate hearings going on at the same time? did it reinforce what you were doing? did you learn things from it?
kurtis: look. he's a showboat. he's a grandstander. you know that. i know that. everybody knows that.
bodden: well, the great thing about the event, it was actually a recruiting event. so can you imagine as you're recruiting - does anyone here need a job?
mcevers: that's mandy pifer talking about her fiance shannon johnson. she was a marriage therapist working here in los angeles. he was a county health inspector who worked about an hour away in san bernardino. one year ago today, mandy was at work.
sherri says treadwell turned to alcohol to cope. they divorced in 2007.

in response to this story, willing to wait sent a statement to npr, which says that the program includes topics such as reproductive anatomy, stds, healthy relationships, dating violence, consent laws, setting boundaries, refusal skills, goal setting, contraception methods including efficacy and limitations, and communicates the intrinsic value of every student without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.
davies: right. and so he actually, the night of conception - at least he thinks - he told your mom, ok, that's it; you're pregnant.
pifer: every note in my client's file says, due to catastrophic events in the therapist's life, this case has been transferred. i'm not able to hold another's pain right now in such an intense setting, week after week after week. so...

liotta: (as matt wozniak) this isn't about your turf. the dope's cut hot. i need to get it all off the street. you cracked the skull of my only lead.
1. the state contains significant numbers of both evangelicals and moderates
-- the upstate: the most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the upstate, anchored by greenville and spartanburg and home to fundamentalist bob jones university. on friday, most gop candidates were at the famed college for a faith and family presidential forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. only trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.
liotta: right. and at that time, on all the oprah shows and maury - and this was 17 years ago - a lot of the shows were about locating friends, family, mothers, fathers - every show was about that.
and i have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.
i don't want to get into his mind — but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers, he said. who knows? we're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon. but his was a flat denial.
lakshmi came out the other side of that marriage, had a child, lost a partner to brain cancer — and still kept working on tv and writing cookbooks. she writes about it all in a new memoir: love, loss and what we ate.
johnson: more than 80 republican members of congress say they're going to file their own briefs supporting this cake shop owner. he even appeared on capitol hill this past week with utah senator mike lee. but this matter has been getting a very different reception in the lgbt community. the american civil liberties union says it was shocked that the justice department would support what it calls a constitutional right to discriminate. and at lambda legal, which fights for lgbt people, sharon mcgowan, who directs strategy for lambda legal, says the trump white house has put a target on the backs of lgbt people in order to score points with its political base.

negin farsad: and can you imagine, like, hillary clinton having fired james comey if she was president? people would like, oh, my god, emails, benghazi, evil lady. she would have had to wear like a scarlet letter c on her pantsuit. there would have been like a burning at the stake. like, it would've been a whole thing. but with donnie, we're just like, it's kind of funny, you know?
sanderson: well, it is a - fundamentally, a reporting problem. and the whole reason we have these reporting obligations for candidates is that voters are supposed to be able to look at the finance reports and base their votes on information. that's a potential problem for him, that the report - this payment was never reported. if it was related to the election, it should've been disclosed to the american people in advance of their vote.
she doesn't want her daughter to experience another side of history that we don't ever want to revisit.
as marriage standards change, a therapist recommends 'rethinking infidelity': esther perel has spent the past six years focusing on couples who are dealing with infidelity. it's never been easier to cheat — and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret, she says.
it may very well might end up at the nation's highest court again, campbell said.
unidentified man: president trump said, texas land commissioner george p. bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and i back him now.
recovery from trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-trump normalcy. recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be.
volz: my mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. so she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. they would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.
liotta: (as henry hill) it's funny, you know, that story - it's funny. you're a funny guy.
only two justices would have held that the baking of a custom wedding cake is protected as speech by the first amendment, said kaipo matsumura, who teaches law at arizona state university.the other justices refrained from commenting on the issue and just reserved that question for future decisions in other cases.
all right. let's get started. our first question comes from a listener named lisa garaya (ph). she's 21 years old. she's indian-american. and she grew up right here in birmingham. she says everything she knows about how to treat people comes from growing up in alabama, comes from her childhood here in alabama. but things have changed for lisa. and we're going to listen to her question.
weiser was elected in a giant blue wave that swept the state last year, along with a new, and openly gay, gov. jared polis. weiser says the high court, in its opinion, never challenged the state's anti-discrimination laws.

gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview i recorded last april with tom hanks. he plays captain sully sullenberger in the new movie sully which was directed by clint eastwood and opens next week. hanks is famous for a range of roles from romantic comedies to heroic figures in films like bridge of spies, captain phillips, apollo 13 and saving private ryan.

4. black voters will be decisive on the democratic side
the only member of the bush political dynasty still in office is texas land commissioner george p. bush. although president trump vanquished bush's father, jeb, and has criticized former presidents george h.w. and w. bush, trump has endorsed george p.'s re-election bid.
liotta: yeah, i guess it did. the first thing i ever did was a soap opera. and i played the nicest character in the world, joey parini. i got it right - about six months out of college, i got the soap. i did it for three years. and then i came to la. for five years, nothing happened. and then the first thing i got was something wild. so that kind of put me on the map as - 'cause that was kind of a crazed character.
donald trump: i'm pro-life. the judges will be pro-life.
liotta: well, yes. but what happened was the love of my life, eileen (ph), died after i gave her a saint christopher medal up on a rock under the moon. i'll never forget the line i proposed to her -with the moon and the stars as my witness, i pledge my love to you. so that's what - but she died. i went up to where i proposed to her. it was winter. i slipped, fell (laughter).
volz: well, yeah, san francisco has changed quite a bit. with respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. and san francisco and then california were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. nothing like that has happened before. so cannabis is very accessible to people. i feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. i think this is a good thing. but the culture has changed so much around it in ways that i find very heartbreaking.
it just keeps going. you're always - you're constantly learning things if you're the type of person who stays open and current. my dad, who - god bless him - just passed away at 98 - he was hip to everything because he read, 'cause he would watch tv. he wasn't - he wasn't closed down about anything. and he passed that on to me - or the way to talk to people. you can have a conversation with anybody. he kind of passed that on to me. he didn't pass music onto me 'cause i couldn't stand - the ironic thing is i once played frank sinatra. and i remember my parents listening to that. and i said, oh, my god, who is this guy? turn this off.
it's the first time the family leader has invited candidates actively seeking the democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. vander plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for democrats, but added, if you're going to cast a vision of unity, i think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.
hanks: ...or the people who came around the house when i was 9.
i can't watch it anymore because i get too choked up. it's very emotional for me, much more so than sleepwalk with me. sleepwalk with me ... never got to me in the way that [don't think twice] does, because it's really these six characters that keegan[-michael key] and gillian [jacobs] and kate [micucci] and tami [sagher] and chris [gethard] and i play. they're not me — they're these people who i believe exist. and i cry every time. i mean, i have nothing against crying, i just don't want to do it every day. i feel like once a week is fine, but if it becomes every day, after a while people are like, mike, what's going on with you?
greene: we spoke this morning with professor ted shaw. he is head of the center for civil rights at the university of north carolina school of law in chapel hill. we asked him to help us understand exactly what's being debated when it comes to civil rights. it sounds like discrimination is against federal law when it comes to genders. is the central question now whether gender should be interpreted as including the gender one chooses for theirself and not the sex based on the birth certificate? is that what's really in question here?
sagal: bill, how did landon do on our quiz?
the irony is jennifer barfield spent most of the last five years gainfully employed. but at the end of november, a temporary assignment ended, putting her back in the all-too-familiar position of searching for work.
i very much would have loved to have interviewed her. i would have loved to have interviewed friends of hers because i really wanted to portray her not just as the stereotypical way she's portrayed. i wanted to portray her as her friends knew her, but none of them would talk to me. they felt that i was the enemy, and i felt i just was doing my job and now would like to portray her fully. i did as much research as i could, tried so many people. bob woodward advised me to stop calling people and to actually knock on their door because it would be harder to slam the door in my face. and guess what? i went to interview someone who knew her quite well, and they slammed the door in my face.
and let's turn to that confrontation between the department of justice and the state of north carolina. each filed lawsuits against the other yesterday over a law known as house bill two. that state law says government buildings plus public schools and universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to one's sex on a birth certificate. yesterday, north carolina's republican gov. patrick mccrory announced his lawsuit, saying the justice department lacks the authority to intervene.
jesse tyler ferguson: (as mitchell pritchett) field of dreams.
when she walked through the airport door in toronto, and canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland was there to greet her, i felt free, and it was like i was born again, she told abc. i felt overjoyed. there was a lot of love and hospitality, especially when the minister welcomed me and told me i was in a safe country and had all my rights.
reaction to the new list was predictable.
later, when my own child came out as trans, i was surprised at how much i struggled, at least at first, with it. i suddenly had this insight into what i'd been asking other people, and including my own mother, to understand. in the end, i think i was glad for her, and i love my daughter and i'm really proud of her. but it's funny how i think having me as a parent didn't make my daughter's transition easier. in some ways and think it may have made it harder.
and basically, if you had polled america, people believed the denials. so he said, for example, that the chief of staff had done certain things. and the chief of staff, bob haldeman, testified that he hadn't. and people believed haldeman rather than dean.

one of the major activities of the [catholic] church, going way back, was to look after the orphans, says stanley carlson-thies, founder of the institutional religious freedom alliance. for that to be illegal unless the religious people change their standard, seems to me ... unfortunate.
gross: so you're shot in the desert of morocco. what were some of the things that went wrong in the desert?
sanderson: yeah. so there have been a number of commentators that have drawn comparisons with that case. i think the differences are that this - the circumstantial evidence - the timing of the payment, most notably - seems to be much more related to the election. michael cohen had an opportunity. when stormy daniels was originally making noise about their affair several years ago, he could've made a payment back then. he chose not to. they sent just a letter. but shortly before the election, michael cohen did make that payment, apparently.
the move is part of a broader trend that has been growing since 2013, the year xi jinping became china's president. from 2013 to 2017, at least 109 universities unveiled their first-ever charters, affirming party leadership, according to npr's analysis.
rocca: but a plucky wendy and her canadian cohorts made the best of it. it would have been awfully hurtful to swaziland to turn around and leave. so they used their snow skis to waterski along the zambezi river. they made their own chocolate from cacao beans they picked. wendy even dressed up as heidi to read stories to masai children at a bonfire. i hadn't packed anti-malarial pills for switzerland, but luckily since canada has nationalized health care, i stopped in at our embassy in mabopane. that's the capital of swaziland.
you won't forget me, will you?
gardner: because in december last year, princess haya invited mary robinson, who's the former irish president and also human rights commissioner for the un, formerly, to come and see for herself the state of princess latifa. and they both vouched for her, saying she's fine. she's clearly a troubled young lady. so basically, the official version was that she was mentally unstable and needed looking after. and princess haya, according to her friends, feels that she was, in some way, hoodwinked and given a wrong version of events. the bottom line is that princess haya is now in hiding in london, preparing for a legal battle, which we don't know exactly what it's going to be about - whether it's custody or money or whatever. but that is coming up at the end of july. so this is pretty embarrassing for the dubai government. why does it involve several countries? princes haya is the daughter of the former king of jordan, king hussein. and she is - that makes her the half-sister of the current king of jordan. she has chosen to come to england, to britain, where she was educated. britain has very close ties to the uae, so this is, potentially, a very awkward diplomatic spat between two close allies - britain and the united arab emirates.

later when emad does get home, he sees blood everywhere. he finds rana in the hospital where the wounds on her face are being stitched. she won't talk about what happened, not then, not a few days later. the nature of the assault, a description of the assailant, the motive, it's a blank to be filled by emad's churning suspicions and fears. that blank is central to many of farhadi's films. his oscar-winning a separation turns on a woman's unseen fall in a staircase.

gessen is also exercised about the change trump has wrought in the perception of reality. in a chapter titled the power lie, gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may collapse in the face of facts and the trumpian lie.
but then i did field of dreams, where i was a nice guy in that. and then along came goodfellas. and maybe that kind of started it. but henry hill, the part i played - he really didn't - it wasn't that violent. everybody else was kind of crazy around him. but yes, i've definitely played my share of them.

and so i think he would kind of edge up to it. he didn't want to deny himself that connection with the godhead that he felt was there. and so he would try to control his seizures internally. at a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. so he kept trying to control it.
he's not my president, she said.
you don't play with people's lives, trotter said, referring to the potential impact of trump's orders on immigration and federal hiring. i think that before anyone makes decisions so concrete, much more thought needs to be put into it.
wine-banks: well, before this happened, in anticipation that it might, we had copied some of the most significant documents. and each of us had taken briefcases of documents to our homes and stored them there just in case. we hoped we would never have to use it because it would have been illegal because they were grand jury materials. and we didn't want to violate any of our ethics and any of the rules. but we felt that there might come a time when our morals required us to do something to protect the country and to protect democracy. luckily, it never came to that, but we did have that at home.

back in allendale, the school district has removed any mention of gender and sexual identity in school materials. it has also removed the mention of lgbtq+ students in the anti-bullying campaign, and it has no plans to include queer and trans issues in a new sex ed program that it's working on now.
and when you hear judge garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the oklahoma city bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. and i spent a lot of time on that.
the new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a u.s. senator who has refused to endorse trump.

your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except merrick garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. you picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. he's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the supreme court.

liotta: no. i used to use it a lot - being adopted - especially when you're going out with a girl or looking to find out a girl. i'd say, hey, how you doing. in the first five minutes, i'd somehow get in that i was adopted because i always looked at it as being given up. i never looked at it as being wanted. i couldn't get past being given up. and then i met a girl, got married, wanted to have a kid. but she thought it was extremely important - because i was born in the '50s, and they didn't give you any information about health or anything. they had very, very limited information that they had to legally give you. so...
the democratic national committee blasted trump for trying to silence yates and predicted the confirmation of his nominee to lead the justice department would get tougher. many top former doj officials, including attorney general eric holder jr. and civil rights chief tom perez, tweeted messages of support. person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill, holder wrote. her judgment should be trusted.

hanks: i remember seeing kurosawa's the seven samurai and les strada on tv, and i'd - look, these things all went over my head, but without a doubt this was counter-programming that hit a very fertile audience, which was my brain. and i think actually the time i spent alone watching television when i was in, you know, fifth - from fifth grade on, that was really quite an education for me because i was alone. and i was - for 20 minutes at a time, i was very concentrated on the subject matter.
saudi woman who fled country hopes she inspires others to follow
hanks: well, actually, no, it was a very good thing. i mean, my parents were so - my dad was married to the love of his life, finally. it took him three marriages to get there. but when they landed together, they were so busy having fun and dealing with their own sturm und drang that i could have been a tenant who lived downstairs.
davies: right. and so not so long after, there was - finally, the business came to an end - or at least its first end. do you want to describe the circumstances of that?
no, he isn't. and so we discussed that, and i wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. you know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like judge garland civilians. and so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.
gross: so in terms of growing up surrounded by people who'd been in the war and whose lives were divided by before, during and after the war, what did that leave you with in terms of what war means and whether you really were, like your parents said, really lucky to be spared?
on one hand, he points out that the american counseling association says you should always counsel from a valueless position. in other words, you don't put your own values into the conversation; you're there to help.

volz: sure. we were talking about the i ching earlier. and suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. and the passage is really dark. the results are bad. and the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. and she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. and the business was huge at this time. and, i mean, everybody knew about them. it was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. and she became sure that they were going to get busted. so my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. and we moved out of san francisco within two weeks.

the university party secretary, institute director and local party officials tried to move me to library duties because of my political problems, but i put up a huge fight, cao remembers. four professors were docked pay, but because cao pushed back on his punishment, he was dismissed.
hanks: well, in fact, i made another movie called, larry crowne. but there is value in the affection, i think, that a filmmaker has for the subject matter. and 1964 was a very, very powerful year for me because i was a conscious being who witnessed the - as any kid did, i was 7 years old - at the assassination of john f. kennedy. and i was confused for months by what had happened to the country, but also by the demeanor of every adult that was in my life. there was a sadness. there was a crippling mystery that had gone on because of the assassination of john f. kennedy. there were still dark clouds and furrowed brows of my dad and the teachers and their friends and every adult that i knew. and to be 7 years old, it was like a vibe, an eggshell vibe, that was part of daily life, and i was uncomfortable by it. and i was saddened by it, and - but i was also mystified by it.
both feel strongly that politicians, at the national and local levels, have failed them. when we spoke in late 2011, brian barfield said there was no such thing as a politician that knows how to bring jobs back. elected officials were so worried about winning partisan squabble, he said, that america's losing.

volz: he didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. but i should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. he's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people i interviewed told. but there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.
i decided to stay in a less than healthy marriage for a long time because of my children. ... one day i was braiding my daughter tish's hair, and i looked at her and i thought, oh, my god, i'm staying in this marriage for her. but would i want this marriage for her? and if i would not want this marriage for her, then why am i modeling bad love and calling that good mothering?
one of the thorniest cases involves catholic charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. under catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples.
davies: just for the record, the actual quote from the tapes. the president says, you could get a million dollars, you could get it in cash. i know where it could be gotten. it is not easy, but it could be done. but the question is, who the hell would handle it? any ideas on that? nothing about it being wrong.

hanks: and i said what? what did i do? he said you now officially have type 2 diabetes. and i - all i could think of - well, what did i do? well, what i did was i ate very badly, and i didn't take any of that stuff seriously. now, look, i'm going to be 60 years old this summer. it's time and order. i want to be around for at least another 20 years, so i've gotten much more rigorous about what i eat and how - the exercise that i get.
the pictures made her basically a laughingstock. there were a lot of cartoons about the rose mary twist or the rose mary stretch that were really hard on her, i am sure. it must have been a very devastating thing for her. i got a lot of mail from secretaries around the country saying, i've used that same equipment and it's not possible. no one could do that. it wouldn't work that way.
do they look at me as a bigot?
brennan: great. let's go with b.
the main question is do you get to object to that kind of anti-discrimination law because it's forcing you to convey a message? said ilya shapiro with the cato institute, a conservative think tank that has supported some businesses that have turned customers away.

johnson: his record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. early on in this administration, the justice department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. in july. the president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. and his justice department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. that case said the civil rights act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to trump's doj.
she and brian go back and forth about whether her obamacare plan is any good. because she is unemployed, there are enough subsidies to make her plan affordable (though brian adds they wouldn't be able to pay for it without his disability money). but if she gets a good-paying job, she'll have to pay the government back. brian is skeptical and calls it the unaffordable care act. jennifer said she's thankful to former president obama for making this option available, even if it is imperfect.
sagal: that was a commentator on deadline.com celebrating the election of whom as president of france?
everyone's so conservative, and they're like, 'you must be this way,'  says robinson, who has lived in allendale almost all her life. but i don't want to be that way.

the event has loomed large in past republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate donald trump famously criticized the late republican sen. john mccain's military service at the event.

this is our all-animal edition of wait wait... don't tell me.
president donald trump: i defined him. i gave him this term, low energy. i said he's a low-energy individual. we do not need, in this country, low energy.
you fast forward to today in birmingham, and that's reflected in the makeup of a city that's probably the fifth-blackest city in america. that's how you get three-fourths. that's how you get 88 neighborhoods with 11 majority. those 11 neighborhoods are concentrated in the south and southeastern portion of the city. and they backend one of the wealthiest cities, suburban cities in america. mountain brook's probably like - it's in the top 20 most richest cities in america, next to the seat city of the 7th congressional district in alabama, which is the third-poorest u.s. congressional district in america, right? so there's just a massive amount of inequity right here.
davies: this is fresh air, and our guest is jill wine-banks. she's an attorney and legal analyst for msnbc. she was an assistant special prosecutor in the watergate investigation in the early '70s. she has a new memoir called watergate girl: my fight for truth and justice against a criminal president.
hong: a lot of women like a fixer-upper project.
kurtis: finally, consumers without arms, legs or heads can buy a soap that truly represents them.
and part of the trial strategy for cross-examining him was to get him angry and to get him arguing with me because we really felt that if he yelled at me and showed his true personality, it would definitely hurt him much more than if he yelled at rick ben-veniste. and my strategy had worked. he was getting angry. the jury was hating him. and judge sirica stopped him.
hanks: then came bronson. it was on for one year. it starred michael parks as a iconoclastic reporter who gives up everything and rides across the country on a motorcycle. it was like a one-man version of route 66. it was...
totenberg: right. we get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal garland likely would have been. this, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. two of the justices, ruth bader ginsburg and justice anthony kennedy, are over 80. justice breyer is 78.
sagal: how do i know it's not smith burg from landon grove? so where is smithburg, md.?
president obama spoke with npr legal affairs correspondent nina totenberg on thursday about why he selected merrick garland for the supreme court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the senate and the impact obama sees for the u.s. judiciary if that doesn't happen. nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.
saudi journalist jamal khashoggi is still missing, nearly two weeks after he entered the saudi arabian consulate in istanbul. and questions continue to swirl about his disappearance. u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo was dispatched to riyadh, while in istanbul, a team of investigators searched the consulate.
siegel: so how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy?
you know, it's interesting. so you requested those nine tapes. the nixon administration said, no, these are private conversations of the president's, that they're subject to executive privilege. and one of the things you write is that as this unfolded in public, his refusal to supply the tapes hurt his support even with his base of supporters. that's again, a difference from what we're seeing today, isn't it?
davies: you know, one of the things that occurred to me as i read this was the power of being the first to set a narrative in a controversy like this. and in particular, there's this tape on march 21 of 1973 where, in nixon's office, they're talking about raising a million dollars to ensure the loyalty and silence of the watergate burglars.
davies: what was the pat answer when kids asked what your parents did?

klein: neal, where do you rate your special on the netflix and chill scale? like, how chillable (ph) is your special?
well, jill wine-banks, welcome to fresh air. let's talk about your experience in the watergate investigation. you were hired at the age of 30 for the special prosecutor's office. you are an attorney with some experience. you'd done criminal prosecutions for the justice department. you were, i guess, the only woman trial lawyer on the team there. how were you regarded by all of these other men - the attorneys, the agents, others?
douban: so it kind of depends on where you are. i spoke with a woman who is white whose husband is from kenya. and she told me that when they married back in the '90s here in alabama, her grandmother said to her, i'm glad at least that your grandfather has passed away already because this would've killed him.
npr's lulu garcia-navarro asks the bbc's frank gardner why haya bint al-hussein, the wife of dubai's ruler, is said to be in hiding in london.
this is a hell of a lot too much family togetherness for me. ... what i'm saying to my people is: we just lower expectations right now. right? our children are not going to learn what they would have learned in school. you know what they'll learn? they will learn that sometimes things are completely out of our control. and in the end, what matters is how we take care of ourselves and each other. so whatever you need to do to take care of yourself and each other. do it right now.
gross: you're pretty well known now. and probably your most famous film is goodfellas. but people who are young don't necessarily know much about anything except current films. and that's kind of the joke in an episode of modern family that you just guest-starred on. and i want to play a clip from that. it's a really funny episode. and in this episode, the three kids from the family - they want to treat their uncle to a special gift for his birthday. and it's kind of last-minute. so the three teenage dunphy kids decide to buy a map to the stars' homes in hollywood and take their uncle, who loves barbra streisand, to barbra streisand's house. so they take him there. and the uncle's played by jesse tyler ferguson. they take him there. and instead of seeing barbra streisand in front of the house, they see you in the front yard - you, as ray liotta. but only the uncle recognizes you. the kids have no idea who you are. so you're trying to tell the kids who you are by listing some of your biggest films.
douban: '97. yeah. i am one of those damn yankees that stayed. birmingham is just - it's just a town that does that to you. it just draws you in. it's easy to live here.
kurtis: i can't believe president oprah balanced the budget and gave everybody a car.
liotta: yeah, i'm sure maybe personally he did. but i didn't really bring that to the set until - i mean, to be totally honest, my mom passed away in the middle of the movie. and they told me on a particular day during a particular scene that i really had to get home that night because things took a turn for the worse. and, you know, i broke down. i went into my trailer.
gross: tom hanks, it's just been fabulous to talk with you. thank you so much.
liotta: i got into the university of miami. i had no idea what it was that i wanted to do. so i just went - i was just going to take liberal arts. i got to the head of the line, and they said, because you don't know what it is, what you want to do, you're going to have to take math and history. i said, oh, my gosh, there's no way. i don't even want to be in college. i'm not going to take any math and history. right next to the line that i was in was for the drama department. i said, oh, my gosh. that's it. i'll be a drama major.
klein: now, at what point in your stand-up did you start thinking, i got to start adding mics? one mic can't hold everything neal brennan has to offer.
meraji: you were supposed to be here for two years.
gross: and they were getting in his eyes and his nose and his mouth. and he was, like, choking and burning and not really liking...

what she hopes, though doesn't expect to hear from president trump on tuesday, is some humility and an effort to make her feel like she is part of his america.
on meeting her partner abby wambach
liotta: no. i got a call from him after he saw the movie. marty didn't want me to talk to him at all. he just wanted - we're just going to go by the script now 'cause he knew that maybe if i met him, he might embellish or - he didn't know what was going to happen. they just wanted me to just go by the script and not to meet him. i got a phone call that he wanted to meet me at a bowling alley in the valley with his brother. and i said, oh, boy, what the heck is this going to be?
brett cullen: (as thomas wayne) you think this is funny?
so, neal, for people who haven't seen your special yet, tell us - just give us a basic rundown of what the concept of the three mics is.
if i'd gone to a doctor and been given the chance to take the medication that i needed, i probably still would have been very reluctant to do it because i was just too afraid. and i thought that i would be wrecking the rest of my life, that i would never be loved by anyone except for maybe my dog. i thought that i would never have a family, i would never have a job. it seemed like my best life might well cost me my life. i just soldiered on, hoping that it would all get better.

i'll simply say that when i came out as trans, my expectation was that people should be happy for me, and i knew it was asking a lot of people, but i still had the hope that people would understand that i was doing a difficult thing that was necessary that would enable me to survive in the world.
the media generally assist in this, gessen argues, even when serious news organizations fact-check the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. right there, the president has won, gessen says. the lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued.
the trump administration immediately named dana boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban virginia, the interim attorney general. boente, a veteran government lawyer with decades of experience, will serve until trump's nominee, alabama sen. jeff sessions, is confirmed by the senate.
meraji: it's not all horrible if that's what you want to do. and, i mean, another thing is she talked about really caring about what alabama taught her and what she learned here in birmingham. so to me, that sounded like she really cares about this place, and she really cares about the people here. and i feel like if that's the case, and she really wants to maintain these friendships, if someone says something to her that feels off or feels like a microaggression, yes, ask the clarifying question, and then if she still feels like it was a microaggression, explain how to ask this question in a better way - if she feels like doing it - you know, if she wants to maintain these relationships because sometimes people say things, and they have no idea what they're saying. so yeah. if she's open to having these conversation with friends and family here in birmingham, i would say do that.
alqunun's newfound freedom has come at a cost. her family has disowned her simply because i wanted to be independent and escape their abuse, she said. i wanted to be free from oppression and depression. i wanted to be independent. had she stayed in saudi arabia, i wouldn't have been able to marry the person i wanted. i couldn't get a job without permission, she said. alqunun's father has denied physically abusing her or forcing her into an arranged marriage, the associated press reported.

khashoggi, who recently has been living in virginia and writing columns for the washington post, hasn't been seen since oct. 2, when he entered the saudi consulate to handle paperwork for his upcoming marriage.
liotta: (as joey perrini) all right. what about all the craziness, you know, about me being married to an heiress, our fights over money or how to live? you know, if i want to annul that, i have to annul all the good times, too.
tucker: there's been a lot of pop music made about marriage. i'm thinking about richard and linda thompson's corrosive breakup album shoot out the lights, marvin gaye's alimony concept album here, my dear, and the ups and downs charted in the many songs written separately by split spouses loudon wainwright and kate mcgarrigle. this carters album is very much in that tradition with a significant difference - the classics i just listed were about marriages that fail. this one is about a marriage that prevails years on.

strong says the party will donate a total of $70,000. washington senate democrats will also donate their contribution from knight to the campaign to uphold gay marriage. in a statement, the ramtha school says the release of the videos may violate copyright law and it may sue.
rocca: yeah. when macron meets with justin trudeau, i mean, gay twitter is going to explode.
davies: so, you know, you're in the position in the prosecutor's office where you've been gathering all this information. and how are you going to prove whose version is right? you hear there are tapes. and it's interesting how that impacted you. you're - the guy who was head of your team, jim neal, was suspicious of this, right?
sagal: right now, it is time for the wait wait... don't tell me bluff the listener game. call 1-888-wait-wait to play our game on the air. hi. you're on wait wait... don't tell me.
woodfin: right? in housing, in education, in transportation and employment opportunities and on and on and on. one of the things we're doing around racial equity is we want to create an equity tool to assess equity in each department. we then as a - as an administration can be intentional about how we create more equity for the services we deliver for - make sure it touches all 99 neighborhoods, regardless of socioeconomic, regardless of race.
for those people, it is the worst of all worlds — they have the school debt without the higher wages to show for it.
pifer: (laughter) yeah, you can have it - yeah. yeah, he was always very encouraging. but he made it clear that he couldn't be the one encouraging me. i had to find my own voice encouraging. i'm blessed to have been left with that. if i talked back to the number of times i hear him talk to me...
if the saudis do offer this sequence of events, they will need to account for why they have claimed, for the past two weeks, that khashoggi walked out of the consulate.
sam sanders, byline: hi. it's good to be here, although i'm still scratching my head saying, why me for romance and love questions?
turkish officials have told reporters that they believe khashoggi was very likely killed or abducted within hours of his arriving at the consulate. one security official told the new york times that a squad of 15 saudi men arrived in istanbul and killed khashoggi. the official said one of the men had brought along a bone saw for dismembering the body.
the barfields met in what was at the time a booming support group for unemployed people in st. louis. they didn't immediately find jobs, but they did find love.
many writers also took on the response from president trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both democrats and republicans.

two free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the gay liberation movement, the horror of the aids epidemic, as well as the assassinations of mayor george moscone and city supervisor harvey milk and the suicides in guyana of the followers of jim jones, whose peoples temple was an influential presence in the city for years. alia volz's writing has appeared in the best american essays 2017, the new york times and other publications. her new book is home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. like many of you, i'm working from home these days. i spoke to alia volz, who was at her office in san francisco.

alia volz: of course. well, san francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the summer of love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. that was very much over. but all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. the way that i think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. there was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. some of it went horribly awry. and some of it was spectacular.
liotta: (as henry hill) to me, being a gangster was better than being president of the united states. even before i first wandered into the cab stand for an afterschool job, i knew i wanted to be a part of them. it was there that i knew that i belonged. and to me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. they weren't like anybody else. i mean, they did whatever they wanted. they double-parked in front of a hydrant, and nobody ever gave them a ticket. in the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.
what trotter wants to hear: i would like to hear some kind of humbling statement that addresses the elephant in the oval office. i want to hear something that says, you know, 'i do understand the power of my position. i do understand the needs of the american people and that i am working hard to remain connected and do what i can to serve.' you know, to actually serve the people and not run the people ... or dictate the people. but that's a pipe dream. i'm not going to hear that from him.
when i met abby, there was a voice inside of me that i finally recognized as my own. ... and following my love for her was a turning point in my life, but not just because i chose her. it was because i finally honored myself. right? i chose to, for the first time, abandon everyone else's expectations of me instead of abandoning myself. and i think that's what i'm trying to get out of this book, which is this idea that we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.

author and blogger glennon doyle has something to tell all the women out there trying to put a brave face on a terrible situation, juggling home life with all the other expectations placed on them as the world seems like it's falling apart: i think every woman on earth needs to lower her expectations for herself, exponentially. at this point, we're not trying to be amazing. we are just trying to make it through the day. her new book is called untamed, and it details how she found her truest self — ending an unsatisfying marriage, and falling deeply in love with a woman while discovering how to be brave.
fresh air weekend highlights some of the best interviews and reviews from past weeks, and new program elements specially paced for weekends. our weekend show emphasizes interviews with writers, filmmakers, actors and musicians, and often includes excerpts from live in-studio concerts. this week:
sagal: that was derek thompson, a senior editor at the atlantic, writing about dove soap's decision to make their new soap bottles look like what?
liotta: (as matt wozniak) i need to remind you about our understanding, raul?
bill kurtis: translated into cat, that would be (imitating cat meowing).
philpott: that's trump speaking on jimmy kimmel live! in 2016. trump said jeb bush supported illegal immigration because his wife, george p.'s mother, was born in mexico. that didn't stop george p. from endorsing trump after he became the republican presidential nominee. as president trump has rejected much of what the bush family stood for in politics, whether it's on immigration or foreign policy, jillson wonders whether george p. bush can evolve in what's now trump's party.
so i went. and he was there. and i met him for the first time. he had just seen the movie. and basically, he says, yeah, i wanted to meet you. you know, thanks for making me not look like a scumbag, to quote him. and i'm thinking to myself, oh, my gosh, did you really watch the movie? you pretty much were a scumbag. you ratted on your friends...
and then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. but we couldn't. but also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. there were multiple erasures.
hanks: well, here's the deal. jimmy nichols was, you know, a hired hand-drummer in the british music scene. and when the beatles did their asian and australian tour, ringo starr got sick - tonsilitis or something - and he could not make a certain number of dates in australia and japan. so he became the drummer of the beatles for a section of their tour. jimmy nichols, live from the budokan with the beatles.
and at that point the process has broken down. democrats have not been blameless in this process. you cannot point to me a circumstance in which democrats have left a seat open when a republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.
david edelstein, byline: have you ever thought about the idea that in american space-alien-invasion movies, extraterrestrials have no problem mastering the king's english? well, arrival is different. communication between earthlings and aliens doesn't happen at the start. it's the source of the suspense, what the movie builds to, because you can't know what ets want if you can't ask and they can't answer. are they here to exterminate us? to save us? who can interpret their weird burbles? a linguist maybe. her name is dr. louise banks, played by amy adams. the aliens have arrived in vessels that look like titanic, mile-high wedges, which hover in seemingly random spots all over the planet. no one knows their intentions. out of nowhere, forest whitaker as a military colonel descends on louisa's very nice lake house in a very loud chopper and plays her a recording.

volz: sure. and i want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. she believed him, and it turned out that he was right. she began to show. it became obvious. so that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that i grew up with. i don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but i sure had one. my dad, however, was convinced that i was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. and because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.

so during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. nobody thought weed was going to cure aids (laughter). but it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. cannabis was good for that. it helped with insomnia, depression, pain. so people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. and in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. it helped them hang on longer. it became very important.
this fx series isn't just an homage to all that jazz. it plays almost like an expanded director's cut, with verdon's half of the story given equal prominence. but the difference is bob fosse's all that jazz was all bob fosse's vision and voice. and i know how he ended all that jazz - boldly and brilliantly. with fosse/verdon, i still haven't seen anything from the chicago musical or anything else from the later years, yet i'm very eager to see what fosse/verdon presents in its second half because the first handful of episodes, like the musical numbers they recreate, are surging with creativity and excitement. it's showtime.

and butterfield had debated with himself what he would do if he was asked, and he had said if he was asked a direct question, he would give an honest answer. he wasn't going to volunteer the information, but he was asked a direct question. and it was based on a document that had been found that sounded like it could have been a transcription of a conversation. it was not, but it led to the question of whether there was a taping system, and butterfield said, yes, there was.

though no one from cast agreed to be interviewed, one family who sympathizes with the group's views did agree to share its perspective. kim and steve vanderhelm have lived in allendale for 21 years; they have two kids who graduated from allendale public schools a few years ago. the vanderhelms still care a lot about what the district is teaching.

there's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the supreme court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. george washington nominated a couple of supreme court justices in his last year. and obviously george washington had better poll numbers, i'm sure, than i did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, i think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.

code switch alum matt thompson, now executive editor at the atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. the shameless return of white supremacy into america's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, thompson wrote.
brennan: sliding into the dms is when someone on instagram especially direct messages you and it's of a sexual nature, hence the slide. do you understand?

i think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. i think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in washington. i think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.
i think to live in this culture means that you're constantly being influenced by what the culture wants you to be, and if you're a woman, it means you're supposed to be thin. you're supposed to care about how pretty you are. you're supposed to care about a lot of things that maybe you shouldn't care about as much as the culture says you ought. ... there's a way in which i felt: if i want to fit in, if i want to pass in the world, then this is all the junk that i have to do. and it took me a while before i realized, actually, no, you can fight against that stuff. you've gone to all this trouble to become female. why would you become anything less than the person you want to be?

sagal: that was scary good. on tuesday afternoon, the president fired james comey, the head of the fbi. he did this, the white house said, because mr. comey had treated hillary clinton so unfairly. and if there's one thing we know about donald trump, when there's a woman being mistreated, he won't be far away.

curry's reference only to freedom to worship, however, missed the point, according to some religious freedom advocates. they say they want the freedom to exercise their faith every day of the week, wherever they are — even if it means occasionally challenging the principle of absolute equality for all.
volz: not in a very conscious way. although, i think it did affect me. i was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. and i didn't have a lot of friends growing up. as an adult, i look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. at the time, i wasn't very conscious of it. i just - i had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. and i knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that i couldn't talk about.

medicare-for-all would end up as one of the defining issues of the 2020 primary, surfacing in numerous debates. even opponents of the effort, like former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg, framed their own health care proposals on sanders' terms.
what's more, these critics don't trust him because he has been part of the establishment; he is a bushie who grew up in the d.c. suburbs. they believe he is exactly the kind of potential nominee who has disappointed conservatives before.
but sanders would not hold another campaign rally in the 2020 race. on march 10, sanders abruptly cancelled a cleveland rally due to mounting coronavirus concerns. soon, even the news conferences and speeches that sanders and biden started holding instead were seen as dangerous. the primary was suddenly frozen in place.
with the collapse of the republicans' health care bill, we consider the impact on arizona, a state where many have benefited from obamacare, but others have been hard hit by rising insurance premiums.
castro: are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?
he paid his own medical bills and had to refinance his 1,200 acre farm to pay for two colon surgeries.
at times, people of color have tried to argue for greater rights in ways that made that connection between whiteness and real americanness more explicit, even technical. in the first decades of the 20th century, two different supreme court cases, brought just a few years apart by asian-americans — one with roots in india, the other with roots in japan — rested on the plaintiffs' argument that they should be considered caucasoid in accordance with the anthropological understanding at the time, and thus deserving of all the rights and civic protections of americanness enjoyed by white america. (the high court ruled against them both.)
a third potentially problematic element of the original house bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the affordable care act. that provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.
bryce is an army vet, raised by a milwaukee beat cop as a conservative. as an ironworker, he has helped build some of the iconic structures in his original hometown — the ballpark, the harley-davidson museum. but he was politicized by veterans' health issues, then by labor issues and finally by walker and the campaign against unions. he took part in the massive protests that tried to block act 10 in the legislature and he tried to rally organized labor against walker in his subsequent campaigns.
i got laid off and had insurance through my job
but in late night, as elsewhere, the personal is political. kimmel continued the story of his son's health crisis by discussing the broader context of health care in america.
stone: yes, people - the 200,000 people in the marketplace, many of whom can now afford insurance with the tax credits. and then 400,000 plus people in arizona benefited from medicaid expansion. and that was the big concern here when - as the republicans moved to repeal and replace the affordable care act.
allowing insurers to offer non-obamacare-qualified plans. this mirrors an idea that texas sen. ted cruz and utah sen. mike lee had proposed in recent weeks: the senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. as long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of obamacare's title i (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.
trump: also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period - we're going to...

sasse agreed and lamented what he called the absorption of civics by politics, which he said has brought washington to the point where parties' need to win has subsumed a prior consensus about the rules and expectations of governance.
sagal: this week, a district judge ruled that trump's blank commission can ask states for voter data.
kelly: one other thing about his record - which is that pence is an evangelical christian. bernie sanders - senator sanders, who's running for the democratic presidential nominee, he was tweeting trump's plan to deal with all this is to have pence, quote, who wanted to pray away hiv epidemic oversee the response.
block: he smiles and wiggles his 10 fingers. new business has come to kenosha county. a gigantic amazon fulfillment center sprawls alongside the interstate. but those thousand-plus jobs are non-union. and senator wirch has seen wisconsin unions take a pounding. last year, republican governor scott walker signed a bill making wisconsin a right-to-work state. and earlier, he pushed through controversial legislation that ended collective bargaining for public sector workers. wirch says those measures and the decline of industry here have hurt democrats at the ballot box.
solicitor general noel francisco, the government's chief advocate before the supreme court, said in a brief that the other provisions of obamacare are impossible to separate from the individual mandate and that it necessarily follows that the rest of the aca must also fall.
— he is friends with the president of the arizona cardinals, michael bidwell, who was a classmate at georgetown prep.
the elimination of financial help in covered california — even if delayed — would not just cause people to drop coverage and insurers to leave the market, but would force skyrocketing rates for those left in a smaller and sicker insurance pool, said anthony wright of health access california, a statewide consumer advocacy coalition.

detrow: reid points out nevada is the first early state with a significant minority population. latinos, asian americans and pacific islanders make up a big chunk of caucus goers.
a test of that dependency is coming with some southern states now on the brink of reopening.
biden also calls for the creation of a public health jobs corps, which would employ more than 100,000 americans as health care workers in medically underserved communities to work in disease prevention.
— he noted that he was hired at harvard law school by kagan, who was appointed to the high court by obama.
i mean, if you look at all of these programs that are trying to make up for either no work or inadequate paying work as companies outsource their labor costs on us, the taxpayers, booker said, those programs alone are worth billions and billions of dollars.
after listening to conservative groups like the club for growth blast the bill as a warmed-over substitute for government-run health care, ryan went on offense, saying this is just the first step of an ongoing overhaul of the health system.
simon: the three oldest trump children are on this list of transition team members - ivanka, donald, jr., and eric. of course, they also reportedly played a big role in the campaign. do we know what they'll be doing?
block: erin decker is the republican party chair for kenosha county. she's excited about most of trump's promises and shrugs off some of his volatile rhetoric. for example, his signature pledge to build a wall and make mexico pay for it - nah.
benjamin: it sounds to me that there's a communication lack there, where either he doesn't understand his course of care or they've not explained a course of care for him. yeah, it can be very frustrating if you don't really understand what the end goal is for your care.
at the same time, look; i think the other thing that they keep going to last night that was so important is these are details that are, you know, minuscule in comparison to donald trump trying to take away your health care, trying to raise your costs. so i think that's part of why you saw them still feeling like we don't have to totally get in the weeds because the bigger picture is still where they really want the electorate to focus.
kavanaugh is a connected washington insider with roots in politics in the george w. bush white house. he has written almost 300 opinions for the d.c. circuit in 12 years — and he is only 53, which means he could serve on the high court for a very long time.
president trump, in this cruel lawsuit, has shown us who he really is, california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement. he added that they intend to prevail with the facts, the law and the american people on our side.
during the pandemic, biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. at the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay, his campaign plan notes.
trump further complicated budget negotiations on thursday with a series of tweets that suggested he opposed the house stopgap bill. the white house put out a statement later that he did support it, and the president ultimately helped win over reluctant house conservatives to vote for the bill.
washington desk editor arnie seipel contributed to this report.
aside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their medicaid programs. states rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their medicaid programs operating. there are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do, rosenbaum said.

kelly: but bottom line - how relevant is mike pence's experience as governor dealing with health issues in indiana to his ability to handle the coronavirus in 2020?
martin: and what was their response?
kodjak: what can't be reversed that easily - the parts of the law that prevent insurers from discriminating against sick people.
the review pieces also offer up a rare, if crude, example of direct public engagement with white identity politics in (relatively) mainstream american political life. we don't tend to think of white folks' fights to secure government benefits and protections as identity politics, informed by a set of grievances specific to one's racial or ethnic background. we tend to talk about these fights in terms of religion, class and other markers, or simply as politics, without racial or ethnic qualifiers. can mitt romney win over evangelicals? blue-collar workers are feeling the pressures of wage stagnation! the widely understood subtext is that most of the folks in question are also white.
the biden campaign pledges to mobilize 100,000 americans to work with local organizations around the country to perform contact tracing and other services that would help address unmet needs in populations at high risk for covid-19.
if your income has been wiped out with the lost job, you should also check to see whether you qualify for medicaid, the national health insurance program for low-income people that's jointly funded by federal and state governments. medicaid enrollment takes place year-round and is based on monthly income, not annual income, and it's essentially free for people who are eligible. you're more likely to qualify if you live in one of the 37 states and d.c. that expanded medicaid under the affordable care act.
martin: that's awfully big. can you narrow that down? what part of the government strategy are you going to be planning?
pragmatic, but conservative: overall, however, based on some 300 opinions in 12 years on the federal bench, kavanaugh is considered a pragmatic but conservative judge, who believes in textualism and originalism. he also often weighed in against president barack obama's environmental protection agency, including, notably in one case — in which he was in the minority — that said the epa should have considered costs to power plants. scotusblog notes that his argument was a signal to late justice antonin scalia to take the case. the supreme court did, and reversed the d.c. circuit's opinion, quoting kavanaugh's dissent.
cornish: and david brooks of the new york times, welcome back.
gingrich: well, i don't know. i mean, i've been suggesting that you find people like attorney general mukasey who are widely respected and have a panel of, like, five of them who have total access to everything and who are able to say on a regular basis, maybe monthly - you know, don't go over these bounds. this has to be fixed. that can't be done that way.
president-elect donald trump named his transition committee on friday, which contains many familiar names from his campaign, from top surrogates, to his children.
the gop's latest proposal to repeal and replace the affordable care act hews closely to the earlier bill that didn't win enough support among lawmakers to bring to a vote.
kodjak: and so that's the source of frustration. it's not the effectiveness of the medicine. it's not the mris or whether the antibiotic works or whether the surgeons are skillful enough. it's just the system is so complicated and so hard to get around, people get sick of trying to navigate it.
in a blistering critique, covered california's executive director, peter lee, said unitedhealth group inc. made a series of blunders on rates and networks that led to a $475 million loss in 2015 on individual policies across the country. the company estimates a similar exchange-related loss of $500 million in 2016.
biden supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and also supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections. the biden campaign says these initiatives would cost $775 billion over 10 years and would be paid for, in part, by rolling back tax breaks on high earners.
doesn't that make the term full employment misleading?
bernie sanders: we must and will defeat trump.
kurtis: too bad she missed weed. she got seven right. that's a lot.
criticized consumer protection agency: in addition to his writing that a president shouldn't be subjected to litigation or criminal investigation while in office, npr's uri berliner reports, kavanaugh wrote another opinion that will get a lot of attention. it involves the consumer financial protection bureau, and, in it, kavanaugh wrote that the cfpb's structure is unconstitutional, because it is run by a single, unaccountable director — unlike other agencies like the sec or fcc that have multiple commissioners.
if you talk to students, the thing that stands out to them is that she really makes an effort to get to know them, understand them, and help them, says g. marcus cole, dean of the law school.
sanders: medicare for all is the most cost-effective approach.
she is taking a more cautious approach than are neighboring states georgia, tennessee, florida and mississippi, where republican governors have all moved to reopen at least parts of their economies.
worry about obamacare's repeal is not confined to residents who depend on the government for coverage.
ron ellis, 55, another obamacare customer aided by baldwin, says he voted for trump despite his pledge to repeal the law. i didn't like hillary (clinton), he says.
his subsidized monthly premium for his blue cross policy will be $65 next year, up slightly from the $63.30 he paid this year. ellis says he went without health insurance for many years before obamacare. with high blood pressure, arthritis in his knees and a potential need for another hip replacement, he says, it's been great for me.

in one opinion, they argue, he laid the groundwork for upholding the affordable care act as constitutional because he recognized the mandate as a tax. (a law professor from the university of louisville defended kavanaugh to conservatives, writing at the federalist under the headline brett kavanaugh said obamacare was unprecedented and unlawful.)

unemployment in kern and tulare counties runs between 9 percent and nearly 11 percent, twice as high as the state average. about a quarter of residents live in poverty, according to u.s. census data.
the question now is whether this version of the bill could pass the senate. shortly after its release, maine sen. susan collins and kentucky sen. rand paul both said they intend to vote against letting the bill go forward. with two no votes, vice president pence could provide the 51st vote needed for passage. but if three republican senators defect, the bill cannot pass.
the sanders campaign said it would assess its path forward, and sanders instead focused all his efforts on the federal coronavirus response. he held virtual roundtables on the virus, arguing the global pandemic validated his call for a national government-run health care system, as well as massive federal spending to help the out-of-work and struggling.
tolson: well, i think he's done well for jobs. obviously, the statistics out there are showing that jobs are on the rise. i think the border wall - he's getting a lot of opposition there. but i think his stance on trying to move forward with illegal people coming into the country - we see that those statistics are down, so i think he's making progress there. so i think that those two things are definitely part of what he's wanting to move forward. and that seems to be getting support in moving forward.
now, in 2020, if she is confirmed, barrett would likely be a sixth conservative vote on the court, making it plausible that there will be a majority to overturn roe v. wade outright.
while barrett's faith came up in her confirmation hearing for her federal judgeship, democrats steered clear of the topic on monday.
the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions. uninsured rates: the congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher.
paul ryan sells health care bill as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'
eisbrenner: right. she was in between jobs, and instead of having to pay the penalty, she figured she could put those dollars to use and get herself a policy. you know, it helped her out in that situation. you know, for somebody in her age bracket, in her situation, it worked.
bill kurtis: mo and roxanne each have two. adam has three.
physicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. at kaiser permanente in northern california, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said dr. ruma kumar, the hmo's regional medical director of supportive care services.
one whose name may already be familiar is randy bryce, an ironworker who grew up in milwaukee and now lives in the congressional district of paul ryan, the speaker of the house. bryce had been running a long-shot campaign against ryan this year until the speaker decided to retire. now bryce, known as ironstache for his facial hair and social media handle, has at least a chance to go to washington.
this vote should be a no-brainer, mcconnell said friday morning on the senate floor. and it would be, except the democratic leader has convinced his members to filibuster any funding bill that doesn't include legislation they are demanding for people who came into the united states illegally.
and it may be possible to avoid the crowding-out phenomenon, economist conor sen recently argued (sen, to be clear, isn't a proponent of the plans — in fact, he says he feels skepticism about the idea). his idea is to make sure the program's funding is countercyclical — that is, that it shrinks in good times and grows in bad.
the election night map in 2016 brought many surprises, but none more stunning than wisconsin's switch from blue to red — marking its first vote for a republican presidential ticket since 1984.
olsen: we're just kind of hoping that, you know, as crazy as trump is, that maybe he's just got the guts to actually make things happen. we're hoping - but we're hoping it won't go too far the other way and (laughter) make too many people mad.
1. sanders announces his 1st presidential bid
at any given moment in american history, the lives and rights of people who were theoretically american, but not white, centered on where their group could be plotted in relation to whiteness. that relationship could fluctuate over time.
policy analysts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.
voters in maine have easily approved a referendum to expand medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around republican gov. paul lepage, who vetoed the move — a key element of obamacare.
a partial government shutdown now looks inevitable after the senate lacks the votes on a stopgap spending bill late friday night.
garcia-navarro: and rena tolson is from columbia, md., and she's here in the studios with us.
but they need to have the help of pretty wise outsiders who are able, in a dispassionate way, to help them sort through this. i mean, they've never done anything like this before. and i certainly don't expect them, on phase one, to fully appreciate how complicated it is and how dangerous it is for the country. this is a country in which 75 percent of the people believe there's widespread corruption. we have got to go back to re-establishing a sense of trust. that has to be an assignment trump takes personally. and that has to be more than trust me because trust me never works in the long run as a model. it's just - it's not possible.
cornish: yesterday morning, he tweeted, quote, a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that i refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it's beyond description. david, can you talk about - help us understand how the leader of our country is leading us through this moment.
the new version comes after the congressional budget office found that the original bcra would in the next decade increase the uninsured population by 22 million over what it would otherwise be. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had hoped for a vote before july 4, but was forced to delay that because he couldn't garner the 50 votes he needed among the 52 gop senators.
khalid: and so, again, ari, that's kind of an implicit rebuke there of the sanders wing of the party and some of bernie sanders' online supporters, whom, you know, many folks within the democratic party feel have really been causing, you know, divisiveness within the party itself.
davis: two of those senators who did vote for it came out today and said they would not a second time around. that's lisa murkowski of alaska and shelley moore capito of west virginia. so once again, republicans in a familiar place - they don't have the votes.
this story was produced by kaiser health news, which publishes california healthline, a service of the california healthcare foundation.
the purpose of having a limited open enrollment period in the affordable care act is to ensure that people don't only buy health insurance when they get sick, and then drop it when they're healthy. that would make insurance even more expensive.
week in politics: debriefing the 3rd democratic presidential debate
nobody seriously disputes barrett's sparkling intellect and qualifications to serve on the supreme court. rather, it is her work on the 7th circuit court of appeals and her scholarly writing and commentary that have drawn such fervent opposition from the left and support from the right.
the lens widens to take in the struggles of the upper midwest, the hollowing out of small-town america and the complicated ways in which working people sometimes work against their own best interests.
and doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.
then, on a day in which sanders flew from utah to minnesota to vermont, everything changed. buttigieg, who had dropped out the night before, endorsed biden. minnesota sen. amy klobuchar did the same. so did former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who had ended his campaign months earlier.
harper: sure. so pence, as a republican, under obamacare, did expand medicaid. he did it with restrictions. so people who need insurance, many of them need to pay a premium in order to get coverage, and they face getting kicked off or getting bumped down to a lower level of coverage if they don't pay. but that program did bring health insurance to a lot of people who didn't have it before, and that helps with public health issues like addiction.
fewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.
cornish: e.j., last hard minute to you.
cornish: that's e.j. dionne of the washington post and brookings institution. thank you so much.
when problems have arisen, obama has often used his executive authority to try to solve them. and it's this very mechanism trump could use to undermine the law. as president, the republican can just reverse obama's actions in many cases, said nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan who writes about health policy. a president can't undo the basic architecture of the law, but you can throw sand into the gears, he said.
and, she said, policymakers should reconsider allowing the government to offer health insurance in markets where there's little competition.
tolson: i think he handled it pretty well. it seemed pretty diplomatic and step by step, following a process that seemed to already be in place.
jake harper, byline: thanks for having me.
anthem inc., the nation's second-largest health insurer, said last week that its exchange enrollment in california and 13 other states was running about 30 percent below expectations, but the business was still slightly profitable. anthem ended last year with 791,000 exchange members.
how will democrats and republicans in congress react to the signature proposal from the freshman congresswoman from new york, alexandria ocasio-cortez?

sagal: on monday, a new law in washington state made it illegal to hold your blank while driving.
the president has repeatedly said that congress must do something to avoid a health care meltdown.
insurers have complained to burwell that the so-called special enrollment periods are too liberal, and hhs has been working to tighten up the rules. denecke knows this, but may take his chances anyway.
during the pandemic, several governors asked the trump administration to reopen the federal obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period.
kodjak: things like insurance, piles of forms, copayments and deductibles and often running from place to place for tests. it's hard to navigate and pretty frustrating. and benjamin says that's what people hate, trying to navigate the system and trying to figure out how to make clear to your doctors what you need.
cornish: david, do you want to answer that? i know parsing through the twitter feed can take up some time, but - ok. i want to move on to something else then. defense secretary jim mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the u.s.-mexico border. and this is as this caravan of some thousand migrants is traveling north through mexico. the response to this is clearly political right now because no legislation is being passed, right? there's no other kind of movement. david what do you see in how we are talking about immigrants, migrants and asylum-seekers right now? is this a permanent shift?

that is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in may because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the affordable care act, or obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.
on abortion access, biden is in favor of restoring funding for planned parenthood. he does not support the so-called gag rule or the hyde amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortions. biden backed the hyde amendment for a significant portion of his career and only came out against the legislation in july 2019, saying he could no longer support an amendment that makes that right [to an abortion] dependent on someone's zip code.
pete buttigieg: it's original. i'll give you that.
amy klobuchar: bernie wrote the bill. i read the bill. and on page 8...
tolson: i think as a business person, he has a clear vision in terms of the final outcome. i don't know necessarily if the first round is the best solution, but something has to be done. and obamacare, great in its idea - maybe president obama had a vision as well, but we didn't get there.
were this bill to pass the senate, it would then have to be reconciled with the house's attempt to repeal and replace obamacare, known as the american health care act.
for the first time, federal funding for low-income people on medicaid would be limited, resulting in what house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative national review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. it's a longtime goal for many conservatives. we've been dreaming of this since i've been around, ryan said.
but figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to congresswoman ocasio-cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. and deficit spending - obviously something that democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of republicans on in some of their tax cuts.

how will members of congress respond to the green new deal?
i'm going to hope that if i have a health issue, i can go back during the year, not during open enrollment and go onto the marketplace and buy insurance, he said.
democrats have been pointing to a case related to the aca that is set to go before the supreme court on nov. 10, which a newly appointed justice could weigh in on. in a 2017 article in the notre dame law journal, barrett pushed back against the court's ruling on obamacare.
the cases before the supreme court are state of california, et al., v. state of texas, et al. (19-840) and state of texas, et al., v. state of california, et al. (19-1019).
what's emerging on capitol hill today is a portrait of a republican party struggling to find a way to govern. so here's what happened in the last just 24 hours. majority leader mitch mcconnell was hoping to vote on the senate's revised health care bill this week. and then last night, he had to abandon that bill when two senators announced that they wouldn't support it. now his plan is to repeal the affordable care act now and figure out what to replace it with later. but it looks like he doesn't have the votes for that either. npr congressional correspondent susan davis joins us now to talk about the fallout over health care. hello there, sue.
biden also pledges to invest in further health care employment, training 35,000 workers on how to aid americans suffering from opioid addictions and adding tens of thousands of new jobs caring for veterans.
tolson: i think that there's a overanalysis (laughter) of all of that and that he...
rovner: well, i think that's exactly what the administration is most worried about. they want this law to have a sense of inevitability, particularly with the opponents still so very vocal and outspoken. and while all these glitches and delays won't really affect how many people will or won't get health insurance, they do create a perception, first, that things aren't going as well as the administration keeps saying. and second, that there may be other shoes yet to drop.
candidates don't tend to put out sweeping proposals because of economics alone.
but health care advocates in sacramento have sharply criticized mccarthy's remarks, saying his plan could create chaos in california's individual insurance market.
i am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days by voting for a continuing resolution, graham said thursday, though late friday he was pushing for a three-week stopgap measure he said he would be able to support. it's time congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up and act consistent with the values of a great nation, graham also said thursday.
laveist says longstanding policy decisions, and population characteristics in the south already put the region at risk in a health pandemic. he points to high poverty rates, large numbers of uninsured residents, lower minimum wages, and general health and well-being measures.
5. hard stories at health care town halls
so candidates are proposing this just because they think it's the right thing to do?
health care is complicated; it's boring; i don't want to talk about it, kimmel said. the details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. they're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. but they're not taking care of you. they're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. and they want us to do the same thing. they want us to treat it like an itunes service agreement. and this guy, bill cassidy, just lied right to my face.

in this regard, kaufman's work belongs with well-known recent studies such as j.d. vance's hillbilly elegy and arlie russell hochschild's strangers in their own land — examinations of alienation among rural (or until recently rural) americans. kaufman finds much the same core values and deep resentments in the upper midwest that these authors have found elsewhere.
the pandemic is also renewing calls for expanding medicaid coverage. nine of the 14 states that did not expand medicaid under the affordable care act are in the south. of them, texas has the highest number of uninsured residents.
elizabeth lucas contributed to this report. kaiser health news is an editorially independent news service supported by the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.
keeping some obamacare taxes. the first bcra version would have repealed an array of affordable care act taxes, which would have overwhelmingly benefited higher-income americans. this newer version of the bill keeps some in place, including the net investment income tax and a payroll tax that hit higher-income americans.
those rates could be adjusted, but broadly the pricing was set in the absence of full competitive information, pearson says. when open enrollment for 2018 begins next fall, you could see big price increases in regions without competition.
cornish: all right. well, now that congress is back, they are reacting to the major delay we've been talking about, which is this rule for businesses. the administration is postponing the requirement for employers to provide coverage or face a penalty. what have you been hearing from lawmakers?

the coronavirus pandemic is a public health crisis, also an economic crisis. nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in just the last two weeks, and no job often means no health insurance. so what are the coverage options for those newly jobless or for those who never had insurance to begin with? - questions for npr health policy reporter selena simmons-duffin.
schultz provides a pithy analysis of what happened in the fall of 2016, recalling how many of his constituents were attracted to bernie sanders: once [sanders] was out and it was just hillary and donald trump, the anger shifted over and got behind trump because they didn't care. they just wanted to crush the establishment.
there's a lot of frustration at the president, that the - president trump simply didn't do enough to build the public case for why republicans should pass this bill. and there's also a lot of frustration from the grassroots. already one of those groups, the senate conservative fund, announced today they're going to try and find primary challengers for every republican who votes no when mcconnell brings this to the floor.
the budget process republicans are using to avoid a democratic filibuster in the senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. it will be up to the senate parliamentarian, a republican appointee, to make those determinations.
more money for the opioid epidemic. the senate's initial bill offered $2 billion to address the opioid crisis for 2018. this version would offer about $45 billion over 10 years, which is what republicans ohio gop sen. rob portman and west virginia sen. shelley moore capito had requested at one point. however, some experts say that around $4.5 billion a year is nowhere near enough for combating america's massive opioid epidemic, as the new york times reported in june.

as slate's ben mathis-lilley has noted, among others, williamson's essay is remarkable in that it echoes rhetoric long deployed against americans who rely on financial assistance from the government — takers vs. makers, welfare queens — but here, that rhetoric is being weaponized against downscale white folks.

president trump himself has since seemed fixated on his wisconsin win, if fuzzy on the details. last month, while visiting that state, trump claimed to have been the first republican to win there since dwight eisenhower in the 1950s.

your options to get covered if you're one of roughly 28 million americans who were uninsured even before the covid-19 crisis depend on where you live. medicaid may work for you, but the rules for eligibility (including the income cut-off) vary by state. states that have not expanded medicaid — which is how obamacare broadened coverage to 12 million previously uninsured people — have more restrictive rules about who qualifies. according to the kaiser foundation, nearly 6 million adults already qualified for medicaid before covid-19 but were not enrolled.
what about short-term or skinny plans?
the lawsuit was first heard in texas in 2018 by u.s. district judge reed o'connor, who struck down the entire aca as unconstitutional. at the time, the trump administration had not taken that all-or-nothing position but since then has come to support the lawsuit.
tolson: if you really talk to people outside of all of it, they really don't care, and they're turning it off. and what they really care about is the big-picture things and how it affects them, you know, how it affects their day to day. and we're all caught up in - is he contradicting himself? look, we contradict ourselves every day. we say one thing. we do another. the next day comes, and we feel differently about it. and i understand that we put the president in this position where he has to be perfect or be consistent. i understand that. but at some level, we need to be a little bit more gracious.
once i'm insured, what's covered in the time of coronavirus?
alison kodjak, byline: good morning, steve.
insurance markets can't function properly without enough healthy customers paying premiums, which are used to cover expenses incurred by sicker policyholders. the three-month open enrollment period for the federal and state exchanges just ended jan. 31. california extended its deadline to feb. 6 for people who already had begun the sign-up process by sunday.
he also pledged to send $200 drug cards to all americans using medicare in an effort to supplement the cost of prescription drugs — though health experts are skeptical of the plan's long-term benefits for lowering prices. plus the white house's suggested process for paying for the plan remains uncertain.

gingrich: i'm becoming more statesman-like in this interview. but i've noticed on a couple of fronts, like people chanting lock her up, that he's in a different role now. and maybe he feels that as president - you know, as the next president of the united states, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators and swamps.
that idea had created worries of a two-tiered insurance system — one in which older and sicker people would opt into the more comprehensive plans, while younger and healthier people would choose the cheaper plans that covered less, potentially causing a death spiral on the exchanges for those older and sicker people.
inskeep: when you're talking about moderates, help me understand what you're talking about here, domenico. you're saying that - i don't know - texas democrats, who gained some ground in the last election, might be a little worried about signing on to the idea of phasing out fossil fuels. that sort of thing?
joe biden: how are we going to pay for it? i want to hear tonight how that's happening.
it's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have covid, biden said on cbs' 60 minutes. if there's a long lag time, a person may spread the disease unwittingly while waiting for results.
wait. i keep hearing we're near full employment. why put this plan out there now?
trump's approach to handling the pandemic is clear from his record. his administration has delegated much of the authority for the coronavirus response to states, including testing and contact tracing. he's invested heavily in vaccine development. he signed two coronavirus relief packages and has indicated he'd sign another one after the election.
so back when this was happening, i went to austin. and i met a man named kevin polly. and he told me that the very same day he found out he was infected with hiv, another woman asked to share his needle.

repeal the affordable care act and replace it with a new plan, which has not been publicly proposed.

even those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. a trump administration really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing payments to insurers, said rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. there is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including aetna and united healthcare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017.
stone: our members of congress were divided about whether they were going to support this bill or not. we had two members who had said they would vote for the bill. and then we had members in the far-right freedom caucus who said it did not go far enough, and they were going to oppose it.
until tuesday, a republican presidential candidate hadn't won the state of wisconsin since ronald reagan did it back in 1984. donald trump eked out a very narrow victory there, adding to his tally of rust belt states that turned red this year and put him over the top. npr's melissa block went to a traditionally blue wisconsin county to ask why.
congress has required that the cost of coronavirus testing be covered by insurers (though testing is still not always available). what's less clear is how much your treatment will cost you if you get seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for covid-19.

sen. bill cassidy, r-la., touted tuesday on capitol hill that his plan passes the jimmy kimmel test.
still, the clock is ticking. if you've lost coverage because of a job loss, that's what's called a qualifying life event. you can go to healthcare.gov or your state's insurance exchange right now to enroll in a new plan.
the impact of subsidies makes hickman's case pretty typical, says shelli quenga, director of programs for the nonprofit palmetto project, which hires navigators to help enroll people in obamacare.
maine approves medicaid expansion; referendums in new york, ohio fail

biden's health care plan centers around reinforcing and expanding the affordable care act — obamacare — via a public option while also improving access to care.
gingrich: i think that's one of many things they're looking at.
there is no way you could lay this at the feet of the president of the united states, said mick mulvaney, the director of the office of management and budget, in a press conference friday morning.
this all means that the new version doesn't make major changes to one big part of the bcra: medicaid. under the original senate bill, the obamacare medicaid expansion would be rolled back, and medicaid spending would be capped — states would either be allotted a certain amount per capita, or they could get a block grant instead. it also caps medicaid spending growth in the medium-to-long-term. this bill doesn't change any of that.
in political terms, barrett is the dream candidate for conservative republicans and the nightmare candidate for democrats.
how a president trump could derail obamacare by dropping legal appeal
barrett has criticized the supreme court's 5-4 and 6-3 decisions upholding key sections of obamacare. both were written by conservative chief justice john roberts, but in a 2015 interview on npr, barrett opined that in her view the dissenters had the better of the argument.
appointed by: president george w. bush, 2006
tate, who then had a private market plan to cover lucas, credited two provisions of the affordable care act for giving his family security and peace of mind after lucas' initial treatment was over. one was a requirement to cover people with pre-existing conditions. if the aca hadn't been there and i needed another private plan, they would have denied him coverage, tate said.
harper: well, it's pence and his entire health team seem to have gone with him to d.c. so seema verma, who is now the head of centers for medicare and medicaid services, is often referred to as the architect of indiana's medicaid program. health and human services secretary alex azar used to be the head of eli lilly, which is based in indianapolis. and u.s. surgeon general jerome adams, who just joined the white house coronavirus task force, was the state health commissioner here for years.
gingrich: well, look, i'm not advocating it. i'm pointing out that it is within the constitution and that we should be aware of it. but i think there needs to be a re-evaluation of both sides. he has to understand and his family has to understand that there is a public interest which transcends them. at the same time, we have to understand that this is a new situation we've never seen before. and the rules were written for people who were dramatically less successful, who literally do not work.
the state that sent to the senate gaylord nelson, the father of earth day, also elected sen. william proxmire, the maverick known for his golden fleece awards that pilloried government waste. and the state's current brace of senators, republican ron johnson and democrat tammy baldwin, share little in common beyond the state flag.
roberts: i'm going to mispronounce his name. matt groening.
sanders suddenly was the front-runner for the democratic nomination.
inskeep: ok. now, let's talk about that because that in and out in 15 minutes, that's about the efficiency of the system. that's about doctors being pressed to see a lot of people very, very quickly. we're in the midst of implementing obamacare, which is about insuring people but also about cutting down costs in the system. has obamacare made people's experiences any better or worse the last couple of years?

he fires up the opposition: in 2004, sen. chuck schumer said of kavanaugh before his confirmation hearings for the d.c. circuit: brett kavanaugh's nomination to the d.c. circuit is not just a drop of salt in the partisan wounds, it is the whole shaker.

the coronavirus pandemic poses both a public health and an economic crisis. squarely in the middle of those concerns are fears about medical bills and loss of employer-provided health insurance.

unfortunately, surprise bills are still a concern — those are bills that come directly from out-of-network hospitals or doctors who provide your care. nearly 1 in 5 inpatient admissions for pneumonia results in a surprise bill, according to a kff analysis. it's possible members of congress will try to address this in future coronavirus legislation, but until they do, this will remain a way that people could be exposed to high medical bills.
proposals like a job guarantee, medicare for all and tuition-free college have moved from the policy fringe on the left toward the mainstream in the democratic party, embraced by some of those interested in challenging trump as the party tries to give voters a clear, memorable outline of what democrats stand for.
unitedhealth ended last year with about 500,000 customers in the public exchanges, and it expects membership to grow to about 800,000 during the recent open enrollment. it has said it will decide by midyear whether to continue selling in obamacare marketplaces.

social distancing is not a light switch. it is a dial, the biden campaign states in its plan. it would create a national pandemic dashboard to share this information. this is a strategy recommended by a top group of public health experts, who released a framework for assessing community risk.
rovner: that's right. on these exchanges that we've talked about, this got announced last friday, the day after the fourth of july. no coincidence, i think the administration was trying to make this as invisible as possible. and what they said is that, once again, computer problems mean that when people sign up for insurance on the exchanges, if they're eligible for federal subsidies, they won't get their income checked automatically or verified automatically.

the whole fracas reads like a fun house mirror version of john ridley's notorious 2006 esquire essay, the manifesto of ascendancy of the modern american nigger — or even bill cosby's infamous pound cake speech. these were angry, very public screeds by prominent black folks against poorer black folks for their supposed moral shortcomings, manifestos that essentially drew a line in the sand indicating who gets to claim membership in real blackness, and who doesn't.
love the guy, he said of george w. bush: some conservatives have said one of the reasons they don't trust kavanaugh is his closeness to washington, d.c., politics and former president george w. bush. at this year's catholic university law school commencement address, he noted what a fan he is of the former president, as highlighted by the national law journal:
that was true of jon stewart when he hosted the daily show, and polls began to reveal that his show was a principal news source for many young people.
but bentlage, 60, hadn't yet logged on to healthcare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace, to shop for a plan. he did that over the weekend and afterward, he was much happier.
these populists seek to defend what the french call 'acquired rights' — health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people — against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. in the united states, they lean republican because they fear the democrats want to take from them and redistribute to americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving — to 'spread the wealth around,' in candidate barack obama's words to 'joe the plumber' back in 2008. yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart.
kurtis: he got 8 out of 8, 16 more points - total of 19. it almost never happens.
millions of american have lost health insurance during the pandemic. biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of cobra coverage for the duration of the crisis. so when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in and the pandemic, says stef feldman, biden's national policy director.

it was vice president pence's motorcade driving by. he was back on capitol hill for the second time this week, meeting with fellow republicans to talk and pitch the health care bill.
economists have also proposed having the labor department invest in creating jobs in the fields of child care and building infrastructure or setting up arrangements such as community job banks where jobs that can be filled immediately would be posted.
even in richland county, where premium increases exceeded the average rate hike nationwide, individuals and the navigators who help them enroll say they have found good deals — especially for people with lower incomes that make them eligible for subsidies.
stahl: you're going to keep that.
you might be able to keep the same health plan under federal rules known as cobra — if you worked for an employer with 20 employees or more. levitt says one advantage of cobra is it provides the most continuity of coverage, because you stay in exactly the same plan you were in when you were employed — same network of doctors and hospitals, same deductible — everything is identical. but this continuation of your current health coverage can be quite expensive because, at least under normal circumstances, you would have to pay the full monthly premium, without your employer chipping in to make it more affordable. your insurer is required to notify you if you have the cobra option, and you have 60 days to elect to take it. (for those who lost coverage in march, the clock is ticking to elect this option).
i have a story to tell about something that happened to our family last week. that's how jimmy kimmel began an unusually heartfelt monologue on his late-night show monday.
sagal: so how many, then, does adam need to win?
it's worth checking to see whether you can enroll and get an affordable plan — according to kff, more than 4 million people who were uninsured before the coronavirus crisis would have qualified for a subsidized aca health plan that would cost them nothing in monthly insurance premiums.
sanders scored more wins — most notably in michigan and wisconsin that provided (overlooked) warning signs about clinton's strength in those two key swing states.
the last time wisconsin voted for a republican for president was 1984. that all changed on november 8. we go to kenosha county to ask why.
white house officials have pointed to this funding as a reason why a federal special enrollment period may not be necessary. uninsured patients' bills related to covid-19 might be forgiven by doctors and hospitals, the white house suggests. many details about how that federal funding will be dispersed are still up in the air, and it's limited to care and testing related to the coronavirus.
brooks: but it follows three years where he's basically destroyed every norm of common civility and the rules by which we used to do our politics. and so we've entered a world where a lot of people apparently treat politics as a cult, as, like, the most important form of identity, which is asking more of politics than it can bear, and then who think politics is a war to the death between two opposing sides, which is also not true. politics is a competition between two sides with partial truths. and so we've got this catastrophizing view of politics which filters down to disturbed people.
other major insurers have expressed similar concerns about doing business in the public exchanges, albeit with less red ink than unitedhealth.
inskeep: isn't that the political challenge that obamacare has faced all along? it's designed to insure millions more people, which is very important. but there are many, many millions of others who don't necessarily experience a direct change?
sagal: yes, a statue of snooty the manatee.
short downplayed the merits of an even shorter stopgap, arguing that negotiators need more time to reach an immigration deal to determine the fate of the hundreds of thousands of people in the daca program.
instead of saying, 'we screwed up,' they said, 'obamacare is the problem and we may not play anymore,'  lee said in an interview with california healthline. it was giving an excuse to wall street and throwing the affordable care act under the bus.
republicans have also sought to call attention to what they see as hypocrisy from the democratic leadership, who loudly criticized republicans in 2013 when the government last shut down, over affordable care act disagreements.

the house passed the four-week stopgap on thursday, 230-197, with just six democrats voting with republicans. the measure included a six-year renewal of the popular children's health insurance program and further delays of certain taxes under the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.

finney: ...and what i think they were trying to get to and i hope we get to at some point in one of these debates is most people that i talk to in different focus groups, they want to understand, ok, what does that mean for me? what's - so tomorrow morning, i get up in this new system. what happens? do i get to see my same doctor? is it a different doctor? does it cost me more? does it cost me less? where do i go? and so i do worry that as we're talking so much about the system, i think there is still a portion - there's a lot of people in the electorate who are not quite sure, what does that mean for me? and that's the part that scares people, which is part of why i think kamala actually changed her plan to try to respond to what she was hearing from people, which is, what's that transition going to look like?
if you do get a surprise bill from covid-19 treatment, the same advice applies as always (this will be familiar to those who follow npr's bill of the month series): call your hospital or doctor and/or insurance company, and try to negotiate a lower bill. if they won't budge, check with the doctor or hospital to see if they can help you with a payment plan, or forgive the debt, as a part of a charity care program.
shapiro: and what are you hearing from voters that you're talking to?
sagal: all right. excellent. we have flipped a coin. roxanne has elected to go first. here we go. on monday, senator john mccain returned to washington to help republicans start the process of repealing blank.
on top of all that, in good times and bad, some people persistently just can't find work.
in a lecture at jacksonville university in 2016 just days before the election, barrett warned that if hillary clinton were elected, the court would experience a sea change in ideology. but as nan aron, president of the liberal alliance for justice puts it, it is barrett's ideology that now presents a potential sea change.

in his final chapter, kaufman returns to the quotation that begins his book. it is from edward g. ryan, who was wisconsin's chief justice in 1873 and foresaw the protracted struggle of the next century and a half with striking clarity.
four years later, sanders pinpointed the new hampshire victory as the moment when his agenda of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free public college went from too radical, too extreme, to something viewed by many voters as a viable, appealing platform.
the congressional budget office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many senate lawmakers. you can't sugarcoat it, cassidy told fox news when explaining that it's an awful score. the final house bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.
martin: what do you anticipate your role being in the administration going forward?
in early 2016, he shocked the political world by essentially tying clinton in iowa, then he blew her out by 22 percentage points in new hampshire.
but so far, baldwin says, most people are switching to the blue cross plans without complaint. joel caceres, 27, of augusta, said he is pleased that his monthly premium for the same subsidized blue cross plan that he had in 2016 will drop to $40 from $43 and his annual deductible will stay at $250. the pastry chef says subsidized coverage is vital for him because the insulin and other medications he takes will only cost him $15 a month after insurance. having the insurance really helps ends meet, he says after baldwin helped him find a plan.
eisbrenner: and as a side note...
to be a good judge and a good umpire, he said, it's important to have the proper demeanor, really important, i think, to walk in the other's shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the litigants in the case, the other judges, to understand them, to keep our emotions in check, to be calm amidst the storm.
judge barrett's views on precedent, however, appear to be closer to those of justice clarence thomas, who has little regard for precedent and has urged overturning many long-established decisions.
an urban institute report issued last week, however, found that some of unitedhealth's troubles may have been self-inflicted. the company's premiums were substantially higher than its competitors' in many of the largest u.s. markets. the insurer also offered broader provider networks that tend to attract sicker customers who incur big medical bills.
kaufman's overarching point is that this question from 1873 is not asked once and answered. it is a question posed repeatedly in every generation, and every generation must provide its own answer.
affordable care act hits more road bumps
don't be a jerk: during a speech at catholic university's law school in 2015, a speech lots of people will be combing through, kavanaugh spoke a lot about humility (and used a lot of sports metaphors likening judges to referees and umpires and the necessity of being consistent).
in their summary of the bill, senate republicans laid out the major provisions. here are some of those big changes that this new version of the bill would make to the original bcra, and what they would mean:
blue cross plans generally dominated the individual insurance market before the 2010 health law was passed, and they have recaptured their place in many cities and counties, says pearson. that helped them outlast insurers such as unitedhealthcare and humana, which lacked that experience when they began selling individual plans under obamacare in 2014. even so, blue cross plans have withdrawn from nebraska and minnesota for 2017, as well as from densely populated counties in arizona and tennessee.
cleveland.com writes: the proponents hoped to bank on the unpopularity of the drug companies in ohio as well as ill will toward them in general after recent price gouging controversies. the opposition backed by big pharma had nearly unlimited resources, outspending the yes side by three-to-one over the course of the campaign.
rovner: that's right. the law allows insurance companies in these new marketplaces, the exchanges, to charge higher premiums for people who smoke - up to one and a half times the premiums that nonsmokers will be paying. but some insurers had wanted to charge younger smokers a smaller surcharge, if you will, than older smokers. maybe one and a quarter times instead of one and a half times, since they've been smoking less long and are likely to be healthier overall.
the poll of 736 primary care doctors and specialists, including 202 in california, examined their views on advance care planning and end-of-life conversations with patients. among the findings:
these workers would initially help with contact tracing around the country, and would also shore up local health departments to address other pandemic needs, murthy says. we know that people are struggling, he says, and the idea is to empower local communities and local health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing.
that said, there's a lot of education still to be done because health care is very complicated. and so that's where when someone like elizabeth warren, who's just a real master communicator on policy, where she comes in and she explains the for-profit health care system by saying, basically, they profit when they say no to you. that's really helpful. it helps put the whole idea of a government single-payer plan in context. and so i do think the debates are important for giving opportunities for what's not just a democratic primary audience but a general election audience who's also watching the basic facts about what is health care, who pays for it, what it costs.
his critics don't like a piece of another opinion he wrote having to do with an immigrant teenager who wanted to get an abortion. even though he agreed with the minority that she should not be allowed to have the procedure, he did so for not as hard-line a reason as another judge.
but the president is not the only one getting wisconsin wrong. assumptions based on fleeting impressions have long led outsiders to misinterpret what goes on between lake michigan and the mississippi.

i know that that undermines the economics and the premise of the aca, he said. you don't buy car insurance after you have an accident. you buy before it.

you know i try not to get emotional, but it was a scary story, he said, already tearing up. and before i go into it, i want you to know it has a happy ending. ok? so when i'm telling this, don't get too upset. leave that to me.
dionne: well, i think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that president trump clearly sort of focused on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration helps to mobilize his base - the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what democrats stand for. they are constantly accused of being for open borders. and when you look at all of the immigration bills they've voted for, they call for - and with support, i should say, back in the day from some republicans - they all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and tougher border enforcements.
all of the jobs would give people paid family and sick leave, pay that eventually phases up to $15 an hour, and — according to booker's website — health coverage like that enjoyed by members of congress.
and he'd focus on uniting states around some common practices, says ezekiel emanuel, a physician and university of pennsylvania professor who has briefed biden on health policy but has no formal campaign position. instead of different states doing different things, the goal would be to get all the states singing from the same hymnal, emanuel says.

kelly: it is true that vice president mike pence has dealt with public health crises before. when he was governor of indiana, five years ago, his state faced an outbreak of a different kind - a cluster of hiv cases linked to the opioid epidemic. jake harper is an investigative health reporter with wfyi in indianapolis. he covered that outbreak. he joins me now.
with obamacare, we've made this gigantic step ... and then suddenly to just take it away without any rational plan in place seems totally irresponsible, says bill phelps, chief of program services at clinica sierra vista, a network of health care clinics serving 200,000 patients. they're playing chess with the american population.
it's also possible that the federal government, by investing all this money into the labor market, would crowd out the private sector, competing with businesses for labor and stifling growth.
those plans would very likely be cheaper than the policies currently offered on the obamacare exchanges. but for people who would like to purchase plans that cover the essential health benefits mandated by the affordable care act, including mental health coverage, addiction treatment, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, costs could go way up.
some conservatives don't like him: there is some grousing in some conservative circles over kavanaugh. these conservatives, including texas sen. ted cruz, believe he is not sufficiently conservative. they disagree with portions of opinions he has written relating to abortion and the affordable care act, for example.
after low-key lobbying effort, trump says he was 'let down' by senators
detrow: nevada's often the overlooked early state. it isn't in the national campaign narratives much.
but as spring 2015 turned into summer, it became clear that sanders' anti-establishment, anti-billionaire message was taking off. crowds grew and grew, including a rally in madison, wis., that drew more than 10,000 people.
vermont sen. bernie sanders suspended his presidential campaign wednesday.
payment for such discussions was initially included in the affordable care act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.

perhaps the biggest change in the document released thursday is that it leaves in place the affordable care act taxes on wealthy individuals. it uses that money to reduce the number of people left without insurance coverage by the law's changes. this latest version adds $70 billion to a fund for states — bringing the total to $132 billion — to help support coverage of low-income people.
eisbrenner: as far as firing comey, yeah. i'd say that was the right thing to do. that's his prerogative. you know, they keep trying to tie it to this russian collusion.
kodjak: well, most people actually are pretty happy with their own health care. they like their doctors. they think the care they're getting is pretty good. but there are a couple of really big gaps. if you are lower income, you are much more likely to think your care is not good.
meanwhile, voters in new york rejected a measure calling for a constitutional convention on the state's founding document. with most of the state's precincts reporting, the measure was easily defeated.
second, kaufman argues that what's been happening in wisconsin has historical significance because it made the state a model for conservative activists who, with corporate backing, were remarkably successful in reversing the state's deeper tradition of progressive populism that dates from the 1800s.
we were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all, he said. you know, before 2014 if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you'd never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition. you were born with a pre-existing condition and if your parents didn't have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition. if your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make.

for me, it's a big stumbling block still that there's taxpayer money that's being given to insurance companies, paul told reporters in late april. and i'm just not in favor of taxpayer money going to insurance companies.
sanders: what i'd like to do now, if it's ok with you - if anybody would like to come up and do a selfie, we'd love to do it. anybody want to do that?
obamacare is a big failure and it has to be changed, he told reporters tuesday. i'm not going to own it. i can tell you the republicans are not going to own it. we'll let obamacare fail and then the democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say, 'how do we fix it?'
the south's handling of coronavirus could be 'a macabre game of whack-a-mole'
lee, a staunch defender of the health law and a former official in the obama administration, has tangled with unitedhealth in the past. he knocked the company for sitting out the launch of obamacare in 2014, then welcomed unitedhealth into covered california for 2016.
editor's note: a version of this story was first published by kaiser health news on oct. 7.
a case scheduled for mid-november could grant an opportunity for a court with a new conservative majority to fire a torpedo into obamacare, the democrats charged — and barrett herself embodies that weapon.
the thing that this pandemic has really brought home to people is that our health is dependent on our neighbors health more than we like to have thought about in the past, jones says.

cornish: e.j., i want to talk to you about this as well. obviously we do not know right now the motivations of this suspect. but because people are talking about who received these packages, how are you thinking about how this episode has had people talking about divisions in the country?
rovner: absolutely. the administration says that that won't necessarily be a problem. it will go back and audit people's claims and compare what they put on their insurance applications to their tax returns. and if they end up owing money they'll have to pay it back, which will be the case when the computer matching system is in place also, by the way.

he's also pretty healthy and doesn't use much medical care. but his premiums have almost tripled in the past three years. to him it's just too much.
simmons-duffin: so like all things health insurance, it's a bit complicated. it depends on where you live, but there are three big buckets to look at. and the first is cobra; so if you worked for an employer with 20 or more workers, you have access to cobra. it's basically exactly the same coverage that you had before, but it can be really expensive - hundreds of dollars in premiums - and your employer isn't chipping in to defray that.

in a filing with the u.s. supreme court, the trump administration has reaffirmed its position that the affordable care act in its entirety is illegal because congress eliminated the individual tax penalty for failing to purchase medical insurance.
barton and her husband, a contract computer technician, had been uninsured for most of their adult lives. when obamacare expanded medicaid, they were finally able to qualify for the low-income health program. this year, california's version of medicaid, known as medi-cal, paid for surgery to remedy barton's long-standing carpal tunnel syndrome.
the congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher. tax credits: some gop senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. others, however, describe these credits as obamacare lite.
it's a big challenge because tuesday is the first day of open enrollment for obamacare health insurance, and it comes just a week after hhs announced that the prices of policies sold on the exchanges would rise an average 22 percent for 2017.

president donald trump: we must never allow political violence to take root in america - cannot let it happen. and i'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it.
another day, another delay of a piece of the federal health care law known as obamacare. the administration is having trouble setting up some of the new computer systems required by the affordable care act. last week, they announced a year-long delay in the implementation of some of the law's requirements for businesses. today, it's smokers who are affected. critics say this is more evidence that the administration is not ready to roll out the law, which takes effect in october.

i am not willing to pay $930 for coverage and to pay a $3,000 deductible, he said. so he's going to shop around on healthcare.gov for a better deal. but if he doesn't find one, he said he may skip buying insurance and hope for the best.
gingrich: that he was elected by people who believe washington has too much power. the washington bureaucracy is too arrogant and imperial. this was an election that had consequence. it probably rivals the reagan election of '80 and the fdr election of '32 in that sense.
perhaps no one can reconcile all this and establish a single narrative for the wisconsin story. and kaufman does not try to disentangle all the strands of populist versus intellectual progressivism. instead, his account returns repeatedly to the trials of the present moment.
finney: well, maybe. i mean, you know, you never want to say you're going to raise taxes, right? politicians on all sides know that. and i think the argument that both she and bernie are trying to make is that your costs overall will end up sort of balancing out because you might pay a little more in taxes, but you'll be paying less in your health care costs. i think at some point, we're going to have to have that conversation, as i say. and people are going to want to understand that level of detail.

in his monologue, kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.

short-term health insurance plans were originally designed to be used for just several months — to tide people over between the end of schooling and the start of a new job, for instance. since then, the trump administration has promoted these plans, and their more affordable monthly premiums, as good long-term alternatives.
the bigger question, though, is not what trump could do to cripple the health law — it's what he would do. he has addressed the issue only rarely — characterizing the health law as, simply, a disaster — and his plans for it aren't clear. it's one thing to talk about ripping insurance from 20 million people who are newly covered, bagley said. it's another to actually do it.

roots in politics: kavanaugh was a member of lawyers for bush-cheney during the 2000 campaign and was a regional coordinator for the campaign. he also participated in the florida recount and served as a white house counsel to george w. bush and then staff secretary until 2006, when bush appointed him to his current position on the federal bench. (he was originally appointed in 2003, but democrats argued he was too partisan and his nomination was held up for three years.) no one else on the president's current list can rival kavanaugh for washington credentials, scotusblog notes.
trump was also seemingly at odds with his own chief of staff, john kelly, over the president's continued support for building a physical barrier along the u.s.-mexico border. kelly told fox news this week that trump was flexible on the wall, to which trump later tweeted: the wall is the wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it.

another way trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. that requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. but executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward, bagley said. if healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance.
stone: it really depends on who you talk to. the number that was held up repeatedly was an average increase of about 116 percent for the benchmark plan here. the caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the affordable care act. the republican replacement for that would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like arizona. and the question would have been - how would people have afforded premiums?

it also would allow insurance companies to offer health plans without the consumer protections included in the affordable care act, or obamacare. that means insurers could sell stripped-down policies that cover fewer conditions and offer fewer benefits than currently allowed under the law.

less than two weeks later, wikileaks released a trove of hacked and stolen emails revealing that several democratic national committee staffers had a clear preference for clinton over sanders. angry sanders supporters marched through the streets in philadelphia, and disrupted the first day of the party's convention.
the trump administration and several republican-led states are arguing at the supreme court that the affordable care act should now be void — an argument that would end existing protections for those with preexisting conditions.
one thing to note is that congress has put funding in some of its emergency funding bills that may help hospitals and health systems pay for covid-19 care for the uninsured. while people who are uninsured might still receive bills from providers, [these federal funds] will help reduce the burden on patients because the hospitals will be compensated at least partially for their costs, says corlette of georgetown university.
but with just a two-vote margin in the senate, they can't ignore republican senators. so it was notable when arkansas sen. tom cotton tweeted that the house bill won't be able to win a senate majority. to my friends in house: pause, start over. get it right, don't get it fast.
wirch: i was a college kid, came in looking for a job. and the old-timers shook hands with me. and i noticed how many of them were missing fingers. and they said, oh, what job do you want? i said, i think i'll be sweeper.
the bill, drafted by ryan and other house republican leaders, cleared a key hurdle thursday, passing two house committees after marathon markup sessions. but many members from the tea party wing are upset that it keeps too much of the affordable care act in place and effectively replaces the law's signature tax with a heavy surcharge assessed to people who forgo health insurance.
sagal: oh, my gosh. he was throwing trash down the chute. he said, oh, my gosh, i dropped my phone. he leaned in to look for it. and he fell in, fell down. and this is funny. he got stuck. but he also got his phone back. so he called the fire department.
detrow: lately, sanders has been turning rallies into town halls where, instead of asking him questions, people vent about their health insurance problems. in carson city, a man named john weigel told sanders how his bills keep piling up to over $100,000. and this exchange may be disturbing for some listeners.
2. no discrimination based on pre-existing conditions
the bit of good news is that the report also found that the vast majority of those who lost their insurance can remain covered by switching to a spouse's plan, or are eligible to get subsidized health insurance elsewhere — either via medicaid or via a plan on the obamacare insurance exchanges.
montanaro: right. there aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, democrats did win the house on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by republicans previously.
but he, like many people, said the policies are just too expensive otherwise.
more than 80 percent of the nearly 13 million people who enrolled for coverage on the marketplace last year qualified for subsidies, which are pegged to the price of the second-lowest silver premiums. that means that as the cost of the silver plans rise, so do the subsidies.
in the river town of greenville, miss., mayor errick simmons says they're still reeling from record floods last year with some residents still displaced.

but denecke said those rules are easy to get around. he knows from experience.
maine's question 2 passed by about 60 percent. the measure is seen as a bellwether for continuing support of the affordable care act, even as republicans have tried repeatedly to unravel the obama administration's signature health care bill.
montanaro: well, and that this costs trillions and trillions of dollars. i mean, the fact is that people want to know how much their energy bill is going to be each month. and that's, frankly, as you know, the biggest thing that you can think about. it's - well, how it affects your paycheck and your pocketbook. and if you have extra money on hand, that's one thing.
martin: former speaker of the house newt gingrich.
laveist says rural communities in the south are not really resourced to manage an outbreak given the number of rural hospitals that have closed or downsized in recent years.
so now, more than ever, we need to push to expand medicaid, he says. to provide a backstop to our health care coverage for many working people who desperately need it.
8 key moments that helped define bernie sanders' presidential runs
two counties represented by the republican leader are among the most heavily dependent on medi-cal in the state. roughly half of the residents are covered by medi-cal, which added about 212,000 enrollees after obamacare took effect.
wirch: it ain't like it used to be. it used to be thousands of machinists union people and steel workers and uaw. and they could just get them out to vote, and it was a powerful thing.

the new york times reports: the campaign against the constitutional convention drew a diverse collection of opponents, including conservative political groups, major labor groups like the a.f.l.-c.i.o., and liberal stalwarts like the new york branch of planned parenthood and the new york civil liberties union. and while their concerns were often different, the basic logic of the anticonvention forces was similar: such a convention could result in an erosion of protections for everything from collective bargaining rights to free public education.
currently, ryan and other republican leaders don't need democrats to pass the bill. they can afford to ignore schumer.
sagal: in a sign that a community can come together and move on, a petition in florida is calling for a confederate statue to be replaced by blank.
the objections about the affordable care act have nothing to do with barrett or the supreme court, republicans argue — and it's impossible to accept the premise that a judge must be impartial but also ask her to agree to take a certain position before she is confirmed, they said.
sitting with navigator monica baldwin inside a converted storage room just big enough for a desk and two chairs at christ community health services, johnson broke down in tears when told that if she did not enroll, she would owe the irs the higher of $695 or 2 percent of her income under the health law's individual mandate. she and her husband live on $1,400 a month, mostly from his disability check and her part-time job, johnson says. she gets around in a 1994 car and after paying the electric bill, trash, food, gas and car insurance, there is little left.
the point, proponents say, isn't just to keep unemployment from skyrocketing during recessions; it's to correct labor market problems that persist even when unemployment is low. and even people opposed to the idea of job guarantees agree that those problems need fixing.
but it is not a consensus position in the party. some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. in addition, many gop governors took the federal government's offer in the aca of near-complete federal funding to expand medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.
(soundbite of tv show, 60 minutes)
a policy like a job guarantee could help win over the left wing of the party. but it's also the kind of idea that may never be much more than a campaign promise.
scott detrow, byline: the day after the debate, sanders was in carson city. his voice was still hoarse. and he was clearly still thinking about the night before, when several other candidates criticized his plan to entirely do away with private health insurance.
kodjak: well, our poll shows that people think their care hasn't much changed in the last few years. the majority of them say that the law hasn't really affected them directly. they believe that it helps a lot of people. they hear that more people have insurance, but they say that it doesn't really help them specifically.
most campaigns launch with a big rally in the candidate's home state. not this one. sanders walked outside the senate, held a 10-minute news conference with a scrum of reporters, and went back to work. the first words of his political revolution? we don't have an endless amount of time. i've got to get back.
i, personally, as a sense of humor, like the alligator and swamp language. i think it actually - i think it vividly illustrates the problem because all the people in this city who are the alligators are going to hate the swamp being drained. and there's going to be constant fighting over it. but - you know, he is my leader. and if he decides to drop the swamp and the alligator, i will drop the swamp and the alligator.
proponents argue the policy's critics are overstating the potential dangers. for one, they say the program would at least partly pay for itself.
but burwell said changes mandated by the aca — such as the ban on rejecting people who have pre-existing conditions — are now so integrated into the health care system that they aren't going away.
chang: ok, again, that was from abc news. so we never actually hear warren say yes or no to the question, will this raise taxes? she answers by talking about overall costs, about how overall health care costs will go down for people. but is that argument going to work with regular voters, people who just want to know if their taxes will go up, karen?
nearly 29,000 residents have purchased health plans through covered california, the state's insurance exchange, with coverage heavily subsidized by the federal government.
that pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some gop senators. rob portman, r-ohio; bill cassidy, r-la.; and shelley moore capito, r-w.va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the house bill, as has dean heller, r-nev., it's not clear whether any of the house changes have satisfied those senators.
cornish: so is there a real sense of what the impact would be, in terms of what this means for businesses or their workers?
there was ostensibly democratic support for all of those provisions, but the vast majority of democrats oppose the stopgap because of the ongoing inability to reach a bipartisan immigration deal. democrats are also withholding support for a longer-term spending deal until an immigration deal is clinched.
on top of that, even before trump won the presidency, 2016 candidate sen. bernie sanders also showed that voters could be won over by a democratic socialist, as he describes himself, who proposed massive, progressive policy overhauls that opponents also derided as being unfeasible. sanders of vermont is an independent who caucuses with the democrats.

this is health care in the united states now, she said. and so what we need to do now is make sure we're working to make this system and these changes work the best they can.
inskeep: ok. so with the exception of many lower-income people who are disappointed, people broadly approve of the health care they individually are getting. what happened though when you asked the same people about the health care system as a whole?
5 things to watch as gop health bill moves to the senate
dionne: well, first of all, good for law enforcement for finding mr. sayoc so quickly. it shows what's happening on the right side of politics that there were already people saying, oh, this is a false flag operation by liberals. and whatever else we know about mr. sayoc, his van is plastered with pro-trump and anti-liberal messages. as ryan said, his twitter feed suggests he's on the trump side if he's on any side at all.

i'm afraid people can lose their lives without the coverage they need, he added.

1. set consistent, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks
states will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. there are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. for instance, states may need freezers to store their vaccines, and given how many people are hesitant to be vaccinated, they will need public education materials and guidance. currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance.
biden's proposal would work to lower prescription drug prices within medicare, create an independent commission to oversee and regulate the price of new drugs, and get rid of the tax breaks given to pharmaceutical corporations on advertising.

in it, williamson rails at white working-class voters for, in his telling, mooching off the government as their families collapse into disarray and drug addiction. he says their attraction to trump is driven by an undue sense of grievance:
sanders also has a proposal in the works. an outline provided to npr shows the plan would be more sweeping than booker's pilot program by establishing 2,500 job centers nationwide.

cornish: david brooks of the new york times, have a good weekend.
all of which is to say: this is a big policy idea. implementing a job guarantee would make the federal government the employer for potentially millions — or even tens of millions — of americans.
it's not that the u.s. hasn't done a major jobs program before. it has — darity said his job guarantee plan is comparable to the employment programs of the great depression, like the works progress administration. however, he adds that there are key distinctions.
and he contended that the creation of the cfpb is a gross departure from settled historical practice. consumer groups and democrats slammed kavanaugh's opinion as a politically motivated gift to financial companies. and they were relieved in january when a federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of the cfpb. but the agency's legal structure is still being litigated. kavanaugh's blistering attack most likely reflects his broader wariness about the power of the administrative state. and it probably offers insight into how he views financial regulation.
open enrollment for 2017 ends jan. 31, with a few exceptions.
cornish: so we're talking about what seems like minor glitches, right - the smokers thing or some of these other rules. but at some point, does all this sort of combine to create a sense that the rollout of the law is kind of coming off the rails?
karen pollitz: the mandate to have health insurance or pay a penalty, the mandate on employers to provide health benefits and the tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies that make it affordable for people to get health insurance would be repealed.
seventy miles south of columbia, augusta, ga., is also down to just one obamacare insurer after having four in 2016. among those who have signed up for the remaining blue cross blue shield of georgia plan, some are thrilled at low rates and others, not so much.
cornish: npr's sue davis at the capitol. thank you.
i wrote recently about a lot of democrats and a few republicans defending being open, for example, to refugees in a way the trump administration is not. but the way we come together is to solve problems. that's what a candidate like stacey abrams is talking about down in georgia where i was this week, and it seems to be working pretty well for her.
notably, in an era of hotly partisan politics, kavanaugh has said that it's important not to be a partisan when one becomes a judge. check those political allegiances at the door when you become a judge, kavanaugh said in 2015 in a speech at catholic university's law school.
garcia-navarro: kevin, i'm going to ask you a different question. the president has given a lot of interviews this week, and in many, he's contradicted himself. in one with the economist, he claimed to have invented an economic term that was coined in the 19th century. many of his critics say - and even in the economist article it said - that he's erratic and that he lacks knowledge. does that worry you when you look at his words and they don't necessarily match up with other statements that he's given at different times?
almost a third of all counties in the united states have just one insurer in the marketplace for people buying individual coverage for 2017. in 2015, just 7 percent had one insurer, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis. twenty percent of obamacare consumers will choose 2017 plans in counties served by a single insurer, according to the government.

democrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of americans and break the bank for millions more, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y.
sen. chris van hollen, d-md., who runs senate democrats' 2018 campaign operation, told npr's morning edition friday that democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to four days to keep the government running and give negotiators more time to clinch deals in stalled immigration and budget talks.
democrats used their time to tell stories about constituents whom they said had been helped by the aca, including an illinoisan, in durbin's case, who might have had a child's coverage cut off and a rhode islander, in whitehouse's case, who might not have been able to go ahead with a kidney transplant.
sen. sheldon whitehouse, d-r.i., scolded republicans for what he called the screaming-tire 180 they'd pulled since 2016, when they declined to hear president obama's nominee for the court that year until after election day.
that insufficient opportunity he talks about hits some groups particularly hard.
those comments he made [about repeal] just demonstrate how disconnected he is from the people he's supposed to be representing, said edgar aguilar, program manager for community health initiative of kern county, an organization that helps enroll residents in medi-cal and covered california in bakersfield.
and democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the house or the senate to stop the bill or change it.
the question will arise ... which shall rule: wealth or man? which shall lead, money or intellect? who shall fill public stations, educated and patriotic freemen or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?
but i haven't seen anything that shows the exchanges are really in trouble, holahan said. that doesn't mean every insurer is going to make it. some companies don't make it, and that isn't a sign markets are unsustainable.

for instance, european immigrants who settled in the united states in the 19th and 20th centuries were often charged with indolence, moral degeneracy and criminality, and their arrivals flamed anxieties around how these groups might change the fundamental character of america. (sound familiar?) but these sentiments waned over time, as these communities were absorbed into the broader galaxy of american whiteness and therefore granted entry into real americanness.
under the senate's procedural rules, republicans can't repeal all of the affordable care act with a simple majority. it takes at least 60 votes, for example, to repeal the provision requiring insurance companies to cover everyone. leaving that piece in place while doing away with the requirement that all americans have insurance could trigger a sharp spike in premiums.

sagal: good for her. according to police...
in an emotional, 13-minute recounting of events on jimmy kimmel live, kimmel said that last week, his wife gave birth to a son, william billy kimmel, the couple's second child. it was an easy delivery, but a few hours after the birth, a nurse noticed a murmur in the baby's heart. kimmel describes how they started doing some tests to see whether it might just be fluid in the lungs, potentially a minor thing.
i do think it is further to the left than what you've seen from democratic politicians probably since the obamacare debate, said adam jentleson, who served as deputy chief of staff to former senate majority leader harry reid. but that represents where the party is headed and not just where the party is right now, but where democrats think the party is likely to be in the heat of the 2020 campaign.
several plans — one co-designed by darity, a proposal from new jersey sen. cory booker, another outline from sanders — also would provide wages much higher than the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25) and benefits that are unheard of for many current low-wage workers.
his critics have also been circulating an opposition research document trying to tie kavanaugh to alex kozinski, the former federal judge who was accused by several former clerks of sexual harassment. kavanaugh clerked for kozinski from 1990 to 1991 and is not himself accused of any wrongdoing.
kelly: all righty (ph). thanks, selena.
stephanopoulos: both senators warren and sanders want to replace obamacare.
trump has said one of his top priorities as president is to repeal and replace obamacare, but senate democrats could make an outright repeal tough. trump says he'll consider keeping two popular provisions, a requirement that insurers cover people with existing conditions and another that lets children stay on their parents' policies until age 26.
kurtis: fourteen more for a total of sixteen.
gingrich: i think they're going to have to find some system that convinces most reasonable people that they're operating within bounds of integrity and bounds that prevent corruption and prevent misuse of power.
he's young: his age is an advantage. at 53, he is relatively young, and trump has said he wants a nominee who could serve on the high court for decades. at age 41, he was the youngest federal circuit judge at the time of his appointment.
detrow: in a crowded primary field, sanders is relying on the electorate buying into the policies he's embraced for decades. still, here and there, he's showing some adaptation to modern campaigning.
but it's not always easy to figure out what the consumer pays. that's because the approximately 10 million people who buy policies through the affordable care act can qualify for discounts on premiums and out of pocket expenses based on income.
trump is set to take office at a tricky time for the health law, with many americans in both parties complaining about rising premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. the republican-led congress has refused to make changes to the law that would help it work better — such as offering a fix when insurers cancelled policies that individuals thought they would be able to keep. as staunch opponents of the law, they, of course, have little incentive to improve it.
who's in, who's left out with the latest senate health care bill
the house bill, wrote the republican governors of ohio, michigan, arkansas and nevada in a letter to house and senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.
there are thousands of people who would like to receive care in their homes, who are covered by medicaid, explains murthy, but are on a waiting list that is as long as five years. vice president biden would work with states to close that gap and make sure that we have medicaid-funded, home-based care providers to care for our older loved ones, murthy says.
but they're finding it tough to start those conversations. when they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released thursday.
democratic sens. joe manchin, w.va.; joe donnelly, ind.; heidi heitkamp, n.d.; and claire mccaskill, mo. — all four in competitive re-election races in states that trump won — ended up crossing party lines to vote for the bill, along with newly-elected sen. doug jones, d-ala. but four republicans also voted no — sens. lindsey graham, s.c; rand paul, ky.; mike lee, utah; and jeff flake, ariz., meaning that a majority of republicans failed to vote for the measure.
she has to convince millions of people who get their health insurance through the affordable care act exchanges or who have no coverage at all that they should go online and shop for a good deal.
people in columbia, s.c., had their pick of four health insurers last year when they shopped for policies during the affordable care act's open enrollment.
it seems yet another glitch is forcing a delay in a piece of the health law. this time it's how much more insurers can charge smokers. coupled with last week's announcements of other delays, could there be trouble ahead for the law?
chang: all right, those are just some of the more memorable moments from houston last night. we're going to talk about all this and much more in our weekly politics chat with two democratic strategists - karen finney, a longtime senior adviser to hillary clinton and director of communications for the democratic national committee from 2005 to 2009. heather mcghee is a distinguished senior fellow at demos action, a progressive advocacy group. she was also an adviser to senator john edwards' 2008 presidential campaign.
university of texas law professor stephen vladeck says he expects that with barrett's confirmation, the court would be transformed into the most conservative court since the 1930s, a court that is much more aggressive in its conservative agenda.
but while cutting funding for planned parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the house, there are a handful of gop senators, including collins and lisa murkowski, r-alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.
the south is the epicenter for health inequities in this country, laveist says. we call the south the stroke belt — higher rates of all kind of chronic conditions.
republicans already have all but won the battle to confirm judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court thanks to their control of the senate, but used monday's confirmation hearing to stress the importance of a judiciary free from political interference and to defend barrett against attacks on her religion, even as democrats avoided the topic.
corrine bobby: it's amazing that my daughter has this lifesaving care now. but you're going to force me to pay a penalty for something that i can't afford for the rest of us. but that shouldn't be my problem. my problem should be which insurance company i should be getting. that would be my problem.
they would all later face a political balancing act of embracing the measure but also, to varying degrees, distancing themselves from two of its core goals: completely eliminating the private health insurance industry, and increasing taxes to pay for coverage. both warren and harris, especially, ended up twisting themselves in political and policy knots, as sanders unapologetically campaigned for a platform he conceded would raise taxes (but lower health costs overall, he said).
cornish: all right, so this rule for smokers, this was supposed to deal with smokers who would choose to get coverage through the new health insurance exchanges. and they would have faced some surcharges or penalties for that habit, right?
harper: so in early 2015, the state announced that people in austin, ind., were contracting hiv. austin's a small rural town sort of near the kentucky border. it has little more than 4,000 people, but that outbreak eventually grew to more than 200 who were infected with hiv. the virus was spreading through injection drug use. people were taking this painkiller, injecting it. at the same time, they were sharing their needles and spreading hiv.
you're going to actually undermine the private economy that's needed to pay those bills. so it doesn't really add up, he added.
sen. doug jones, d-ala., is behind the bill. he says expanding medicaid would help protect everyone in these uncertain times.
a big unknown is how aggressive trump would remain in going beyond rhetorically opposing obamacare, said thomas miller, a resident fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute. his report card as a presidential candidate reads, 'donald needs to improve his attention, effort, and study habits. he is easily distracted and seems to prefer just picking fights with others.'

this separates it from a job subsidy program, he said, in which the government would help boost the number of jobs — perhaps massively so — but neither create all those jobs itself nor guarantee the jobs to those seeking one.
newt gingrich: well, i think he needs to set a direction that allows people who are deeply opposed to obamacare to realize it's gradually going to be reformed and rethought. a lot of the initial phase, frankly, i suspect - i don't know for a fact - but i suspect that the opening 48 or 72 hours will have so many executive orders repealing obama's executive orders that the average conservative will be giddy with excitement.

the other seven candidates were trying for their own breakout moments, too.
my impression is it may have been the shock effect of trump's election and the recognition that there are a host of policies, projects, that we previously didn't think were imaginable or reasonable that are being considered on the other end of the political spectrum, said william darity, an economist at duke university and a proponent of job guarantee programs.
eliminating the aca would end medical insurance for more than 20 million americans. it would also end widely popular provisions of the law, such as extending parents' coverage to children up to the age of 26 and prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.
garcia-navarro: all right, let's talk about the things that the president promised on the campaign trail - building the border wall, affordable health care, bringing back jobs. there's a lot there, but i'd like to know where you think he's done well and where you'd still like to see him do more. let's start with you, rena.

mcconnell could vote no on the measure for procedural reasons so that he reserves the ability to bring up a substitute bill later. sen. john mccain, r-ariz., was not present for the vote.

reexamining mike pence's record on health care as indiana governor
some of those who favor the law, or rely on it, see a conflict between mccarthy's stated goals as a national leader and the needs of so many of his constituents.
gingrich: well, a large part of his holdings are trump golf clubs, trump hotels. i mean, we have never quite had anyone of this scale to occupy the white house. and it's going to require us to think about - how do you deal with this in a way that's effective and that serves the interests of the country but also meets some kind of practical, common-sense test?
i never imagined i would get involved in something like this, kimmel said. this is not my area of expertise. my area of expertise is eating pizza, and that's really about it. but we can't let them do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us.
davis: you know, i talked to a lot of republicans. the word you hear a lot is they say they're disappointed. they did the best we could. but there's a lot of simmering tensions going on here beneath the surface, audie. there is frustration between the conservative and moderate wings blaming each other for why this went down. there's frustration from some republicans towards mitch mcconnell and how he put this bill together.
collins, who says she did not vote for trump in 2016, has yet to say whether she will support him in 2020.
the department of health and human services expects about 10 million people to be enrolled in federal and state exchanges at the end of 2016. that's far below previous government forecasts.
but that doesn't help the millions of people with higher incomes who don't qualify for subsidies and are facing higher premiums. for them, the loss of insurance competition and higher rates has been a double blow, according to insurance agents. people are getting slammed and having to pay through the nose, says jocelyn boland, an insurance agent in the columbia, s.c., area who is handling about 500 obamacare clients this year. i have a lot of upset people.
and, biden is calling on every american to wear a mask when they are close to people outside their household. he says he'd work with every governor to make this mandatory in their state. many states already have mask mandates, but at a time when research suggests that universal masking could save more than 100,000 lives, there's currently no nationwide coordination or requirement.
richland was one of 74 counties that dropped from at least four insurers in 2016 to just one in 2017, according to a kaiser health news analysis of federal data for the 39 states that enroll people through healthcare.gov. in 66 of those counties, the blue cross and blue shield affiliated plan was the sole survivor.

the presidential candidate, in a nevada campaign stop, pushed back on criticism of his medicare for all plan. instead of asking sanders questions, people have vented about health insurance problems.
eisbrenner: you know, the investigation really starts out with flynn because he could have been compromised as national security adviser, yes. look - they've got to definitely look into that. now, feel free to look into the collusion part, too, but i doubt very much they're going to find anything that affected the election. so - but, hey, if they want to - if the fbi wants to investigate it, go right ahead, you know. i have no problem with that.
kelly: it sounds a little daunting with all of those buckets and so many things to look at and check on. where do i go just to find out what i can get?
so i think we will see our representatives in congress saying we still need to do something about this law, and it needs to be something that works and actually brings down costs. and i'm sure some people here are breathing a sigh of relief because the republican replacement could have forced some tough decisions for things like medicaid here in arizona.
what's different about the job guarantee is that it is universal and it's permanent. so it's an option that would exist not only in times of massive unemployment, but it also would exist in times where the unemployment rate is lower, darity said. but we still have large numbers of bad jobs. it's not just an emergency.
sagal: following a two-day meeting, the federal reserve decided to leave key blank rates unchanged.
one way to take the temperature of the republican party's ongoing tumult this election cycle is to consult the national review, the conservative magazine founded in 1955 by william f. buckley. the magazine has been so opposed to donald trump that it pitched its entire january issue against his candidacy. a number of right-leaning luminaries contributed, warning primary voters that the reality tv mogul's continued rise could doom the conservative project writ large.
sagal: on sunday british cyclist chris froome won his fourth blank title.
some of the fiercest counterattacks on barrett's behalf came from sens. josh hawley of missouri and ben sasse of nebraska, who each, in their turn, faulted what they called the attempt by critics to impose a religious test for the supreme court.
kodjak: yeah, it is. and it - one of the problems is that there actually are a lot of additional benefits from obamacare and people's insurance, but they don't see that directly. you get free mammograms. you get free colonoscopies. you get free birth control. if you had an illness, you can still buy insurance because they can't exclude you for a pre-existing condition. those aren't apparent to most of the people that we surveyed.
bernie sanders: but i was not pleased that vice president biden distorted what medicare for all is and, in fact, simply parroted the line coming from the health care industry.
he went on to praise the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, for bringing access to health care to people who couldn't afford it.
shutdowns are usually the product of divided government, but this likely shutdown would be the first time one occurred when the same party controlled both chambers of congress and the white house.
and that raises another important point — in this era in which trust in politicians, congress, washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.
barrett's critics, for instance, point to her judicial writing in a major gun case. in 2008, the supreme court ruled for the first time that the constitution guarantees the right to own a gun. but justice scalia, writing for the court, listed some exceptions, among them laws barring felons from owning guns. when one of those felon laws came before judge barrett, she dissented, maintaining that the supreme court didn't really mean to exclude gun ownership for felons who aren't dangerous.
harmel says most of his covered california clients earn too much to qualify for the federal subsidies that reduce monthly premiums. he said most are paying more now than they did before the law and didn't need the new rules to be able to buy insurance. a forced coverage system is not the answer, he said.

still, his campaign faced a lot of uncertainties. most notably: how many progressives who backed sanders in the two-candidate 2016 contest would migrate to warren or any of the other two dozen democrats who entered the race?
julian castro: are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?
detrow: sanders and his wife, jane, spoke with weigel after the event. and sanders supporters have since set up an online fundraising effort to help him with those bills. after carson city, it was on to reno in las vegas. nevada is the third state up in the presidential contest. that's due largely to the influence of one man, former senate majority leader harry reid. reid's retired now and battling cancer. but he's still paying close attention, and he's still in touch with the 2020 candidates. so i drove to his house in the las vegas suburbs.

even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. like civil suits, criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. and a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president.

on the other hand, some conservatives in the senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. ted cruz, r-texas; mike lee, r-utah; and rand paul, r-ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the aca, with paul referring to it as obamacare lite. they worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.

patients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.
gingrich: well, i suspect - i don't know this - but i suspect that they got drowned in picking the cabinet. but they're going to have to do it sooner or later. i mean, the longer they wait, the greater the irritation will be and the more concerned people will be. so it's not to their advantage, you know, to get to the inaugural without having sorted this out.

the american enterprise institute's james pethokoukis put it more bluntly: government funds that end up in the hands of likely gop voters (medicare and social security) are considered earned benefits, but those that help likely democratic voters (medicaid, obamacare, income supports) are slapped with the stigmatized welfare label.
then, at the very end of a televised debate, sanders' campaign announced a major endorsement: progressive star rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez. that weekend, she and sanders rallied in front of more than 20,000 people in new york city. suddenly sanders had life again — his campaign contributions shot up, his poll numbers rose, and it was warren, not sanders, who was facing questions about viability.

in a speech on the lawsuit thursday, former vice president joe biden said he was proud of the aca and denounced the administration's position. it's cruel, it's heartless, and it's callous, he said.
kamala harris: but first, i have a few words for donald trump, who we all know is watching.
if trump wanted to seriously damage the aca, he could simply order the appeal dropped, letting the lower court ruling stand, and stop reimbursing insurers who are giving deep discounts to half their customers. that move would wreak havoc, said michael cannon of the libertarian cato institute, a longtime opponent of the health law. the insurers would still have to provide the discounts, as required by law, he said, but they're no longer getting subsidies from the federal government to cover the cost. so they are going to be selling insurance to these people way below the cost of that coverage.

this is all to say, the tug of war over who gets to enjoy the benefits reserved for real americans has always been all tied up with racial politics. people of color were overwhelmingly excluded during the glory days that so many white voters this election cycle look back on as better times. that's why trump's make america great again mantra reads so menacingly to so many — whiteness seems to be a necessary precondition for that nostalgia.
detrow: several of the campaigns say immigration, climate change and affordable housing are key issues in nevada. in las vegas, sanders rolled out a $2.5 trillion plan to expand affordable housing and address homelessness.
these national review offerings help demarcate the widening, well-documented chasm between the republican party's base and, with apologies to williamson, its establishment. what's fascinating is the similarity of the charge on both sides of the fence. the base's ongoing complaint — that the party establishment is out of touch with the concerns of real americans — and williamson's screed essentially send the same message: act right, or risk getting kicked out of the club.
some conservatives, though, question his bona fides, and he is controversial with democrats because of his role investigating president bill clinton as part of the starr investigation in the 1990s. and he now believes that a sitting president should be protected from litigation and criminal investigations because they are time-consuming and distracting.
so why — politically — is this happening now? one explanation is that democrats are trying to rebuild after a devastating election in 2016, which many emerged from thinking the party didn't have a clear message for what it stood for.

trump has attempted to usher through prescription drug reforms via a series of executive orders signed in july and september, though the timeline for seeing these policies implemented remains uncertain. a notable order would lower drug prices for those on medicare parts b and d to comparable costs seen internationally.

that's why the bill does not wipe away all the aca's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.
as republicans have been vowing for years, the house-passed bill would defund planned parenthood, although only for a year. that's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the cbo, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for medicaid. birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.

the senate passed a repeal bill in 2015, but it was vetoed by then-president barack obama. the congressional budget office warned in january that repealing obamacare without a replacement would be highly destabilizing for the individual insurance market, leaving 32 million more americans without health coverage within a decade. (that's significantly more than the uninsured projections for republican house and senate replacement bills.)
health savings accounts will be able to pay for premiums. under irs rules, people with high-deductible plans are eligible for health savings accounts (hsas), accounts into which people can put money for health care expenses tax-free. under this bill, people would for the first time be able to use that money for premiums. americans' deposits in hsas have ballooned over the last decade, according to hsa consulting firm devenir. however, those accounts also tend to benefit higher-income people more than others, as kaiser health news' michelle andrews wrote in december — for example, richer people are more likely to have the extra money to sock away for health expenses.

a central goal of the mainstream conservative establishment (of which the national review is a part) has been to stunt and roll back the size and influence of government, with the welfare state right in the crosshairs. but to the chagrin of the republican brass, trump's vocal support for some types of social safety nets that conservatives are supposed to disdain — claiming, for example, that he would replace obamacare with a single-payer health care system — hasn't repulsed the downscale rank and file.
mccammon: (laughter) nice one there, scott. of course, christie is under a bit of a cloud right now after some of his close aides were recently convicted in that bridgegate scandal. so he put pence - and we don't know for sure if this is why, but these events did follow each other. pence is stepping into the lead, you know, leading the effort to create a cabinet and fill other appointments. we did see some hints of this because christie himself had said that trump was not in the initial transition meeting on wednesday this week, and pence was there, apparently leading things. pence, of course, has experience in both congress and as the governor of indiana - experience that will likely be useful for trump, who, of course, has never held a position in government.
what's more, republicans are trying to push the bill through before the congressional budget office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. prior versions of republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the aca.
simmons-duffin: yeah, it's really a lot of people. so 6 million of that 27 million actually do qualify for medicaid. they just don't know it. so they can go and enroll at any time. beyond that, if you don't qualify for medicaid, then you might be able to go to the obamacare exchanges. a dozen or more states that run their own marketplaces have opened what's called a special enrollment period. so if you live in one of those states, you can shop there. you don't have to prove you just had a job loss or something like that.
kodjak: yeah, and we had a lot of people say they're really frustrated that doctors are in and out in 15 minutes. they don't really hear what the problem is.
just like in the past, the current debate over who gets to be a real american is all tied up with bigger debates about race and immigration. what's so fascinating about the latest iteration of this fight is that many white conservatives — whether downscale or establishment — suddenly see their fellow real americans standing on the wrong side of the line.
she suggests that didn't happen because insurers had to file their initial 2017 rates to regulators earlier this year, before they knew exactly where competitors were dropping out.
will stone, byline: hello. great to be here.
at least four democrats are expected to face off to win their party's nomination in order to face collins in november 2020. collins will enter the race with an $8.6 million reelection war chest, and she is running television ads statewide portraying herself as an independent, bipartisan senator.
bernie 2020 looked very different than bernie 2016 in several ways. among them: a deliberate effort to do fewer mega-rallies — at least in the early months of the race — and instead focus on more intimate town halls where people in the audience shared their struggles with health care access and costs.
martin: is that something you've suggested to the transition team?
sasse said he hopes washington and americans more broadly can recover what he called the importance of civics, which would lower the temperature on disputes like that over barrett's nomination.
in a city that has a 38.6% poverty rate, this covid-19 is exacerbating all of the issues that we're having, simmons says. the acute nature of the pandemic's economic downturn is felt more here than many other places.
dionne: i think that the voters disagree with david, that the - if you look at all of the polling, the top - of the top three issues, health care and economics rank one, two or two, one in where - where the voters come from. i think trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize. and i think national unity does not come simply from defending pluralism, which, by the way, democrats do.
the biden campaign also wants to solve the ppe shortages that have plagued the u.s. health care system since the pandemic began, stating that it would produce more of these critical supplies, rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.
the news that collins, 67, will launch a bid for a fifth term came a day after she told npr that she was undecided on whether to convict trump in a potential senate trial, which could start as soon as next month, over his conduct with ukraine.
ryan's pitch comes at a time when many key trade groups are voicing major concerns about the repeal. the american medical association sent a letter to lawmakers bemoaning an expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.
inskeep: that's npr's domenico montanaro. and he speaks on this day, when some democrats will release a green new deal resolution.
mccammon: things seem to be softening a little bit. his advisers have given mixed messages about the wall with mexico, the ban on muslim immigration and other issues. and here's what he said on 60 minutes about the affordable care act.
mcghee: you know, i think every time democrats talk about health care, they're winning, right? they're comparing themselves to the republicans who want to take away the protections for preexisting conditions, who want to kill obamacare altogether. and it remains the most popular and important and pressing issue for american voters.
mccammon: well, there are a lot of rumors, among them steve bannon, trump's campaign ceo, and rnc chairman reince priebus, who are both on the transition team. there has been speculation that one of them might be a candidate for trump's chief-of-staff. bannon is, of course, the former head of breitbart news, and he has said he would go back there. choosing him, though, would elevate a key figure in the alt-right movement, which has been associated with white nationalism. his website, for instance, has promoted many conspiracy theories that have been debunked. some of the people leading the committee, also, are names we have heard before during the campaign - dr. ben carson, former new york mayor rudy giuliani, former house speaker newt gingrich - and chris christie is still part of the team. there are also some names that are familiar in washington and wall street - you know, two big establishment cities that trump has promised supporters he would tear down the establishment during the campaign.
rocca: she stole a taxi. and then she began charging customers.
but over the course of spring 2016, clinton steadily grew her delegate lead over sanders, winning key blowout victories in southern states with lots of african-american voters. sanders refused to drop out, and campaigned through june. even after clinton clinched the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, sanders still didn't concede until shortly before the democratic national convention.

the idea is that we would then drive bad jobs out of existence, said darity, because no one would be obligated to take those jobs since they would have a superior option.
regionwide, eight of the 10 states with the biggest jumps in unemployment claims are in the south.
and she did, getting the law school to quickly purchase the needed software, says wolk, who would go on to graduate second in her class and serve as a law clerk for justice clarence thomas.
i think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion, she said.
gabe nudo: make america great - that's what we need.
republicans stepped up their attacks on democrats throughout the day friday, blaming them for forcing the standoff. mcconnell, r-ky., accused democrats of using immigration as a bargaining chip in the fight.
kelly: ok. questions also being raised today about the wisdom of putting pence in charge with coronavirus because of his role in slashing the public health budget in indiana when he was governor, which prompts me to ask - did mike pence, as governor, do anything that public health officials liked?
kelly: wow. it's the whole indiana team - upped stakes and moved to d.c.
collins could face a tough reelection. americans remain deeply divided over impeachment and a host of other hot-button political issues. although collins has carried her state's tradition of political independence in the senate, she has been assailed by her constituents in maine for her vote to confirm supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, despite her self-identification as an abortion-rights supporter. critics to her left have also attacked collins for her opposition to the affordable care act, aka obamacare, and for backing the republican-sponsored tax cut, a measure that liberals criticize as a giveaway to the rich.
for those who say kimmel has crossed over and become too political. he had a message for them, too: before you post the nasty facebook message saying i'm politicizing my son's health problems, i want you to know, i am politicizing my son's health problems, because i have to. but my family has health insurance. we don't have to worry about this, but other people do. so you can shove your disgusting comments where your doctor won't be giving you a prostate exam once they take your health care benefits away.
greene: that was my colleague rachel martin talking to newt gingrich.
gillibrand's office tells npr that she has a plan forthcoming, to be released in the next few weeks.
there are only so many things you can do in that bill because of senate floor rules, reconciliation, ryan said. you can't put everything you want in that legislation, because if you did it would be filibustered, and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the senate.
lower the price of prescription drugs and insurance premiums.
trump has also backed an end to surprise billing, which members of congress have sought to take up.
sagal: all right, mo. mo, you are up next. fill in the blank. following a closed-door meeting with senators, president trump's son-in-law blank reasserted that he did not collude with russia.
but kaufman is not satisfied with blaming the people's anger alone for what has happened in wisconsin. he explores other more deliberate and systemic factors that dragged down clinton and other democrats in recent election cycles.
even casual students of history have heard of robert la follette, champion of the common man and longtime statewide hero. the original fighting bob served as governor, senator and presidential candidate in the early 20th century and remains a beacon to progressives today. some also know that milwaukee routinely elected socialist mayors for nearly half a century.
president-elect trump and congress have a couple of options in deciding how to best repeal the affordable care act, each with dramatically different impacts. npr sorts through the options and looks at how existing obamacare insurance plans will be affected.
selena simmons-duffin, byline: hi, mary louise.
martin: does that sit well with you, the idea that president trump could pardon a member of his family or his administration if that person was acting in the best interest of his corporation but not the government?

insofar as we're maintaining an environment in which prices are lower for products because people are poorly paid, i think that that's a real ethical concern for any society, he said.
this investment would be paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthier americans.
garcia-navarro: that's reporter will stone. he's part of a reporting partnership between npr, kaiser health news and member station kjzz.
we will be looking at united as a plan to see if they offer good value for californians. it's to be determined on both ends.
his tax credit more than doubled to $664 a month, and he found a policy that would cost him, after that subsidy, about $150 a month. and his deductible was lower, too.
house majority leader kevin mccarthy wants to repeal the affordable care act first and replace it sometime later. that doesn't sit well with victoria barton, who lives in mccarthy's rural california district.
harper: i don't think so. i think the quote from him was that he was going to go home and pray on the decision of whether to authorize a needle exchange. he ended up authorizing the exchange, but i don't get the sense from reading that quote that he was trying to pray away the problem of hiv.

booker is the only one of these three with a fully fleshed-out proposal out there. his plan, unveiled late in april, would create pilot job guarantee programs in 15 communities where unemployment is particularly high.
in her remarks to supporters, collins acknowledged the political polarization of the moment, presenting herself as a someone who can work to build consensus.

eisbrenner: you know, i think it's a slight improvement. i don't think it's the answer, though. i really don't. i don't think it's going to help everybody across the board - no. and that's why my belief is keep the government out of health care. the government, really, anything they get involved in, for the most part, in my opinion, they don't do a good job at it. you know, my daughter had to go get an obamacare policy, and it saved her bacon, you know, with some things going on. she got a policy. but then, for every story of my daughter, there's 50 where people went the opposite way. it really screwed them over.
that more contemporary story begins as republican scott walker wins the governorship in 2010, the tea party year, running against obamacare and the democratic power structure in madison, the state capital. walker would drive legislation known as act 10 to take down the public employee unions (including their right to collective bargaining). he would then survive a recall, win re-election and push new legislation to make wisconsin a right-to-work state in 2015, breaking a promise he had made to the private sector unions.
on monday, they used it to talk about what they called the real subject of the proceedings this week: the desire by president trump and republicans to sink the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, via a ruling from the high court.
cory booker: we know donald trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage...

just months after that speech, barrett was named to the 7th circuit, where she dissented in an abortion case involving an indiana law barring abortions based on fetal disability or gender. while the dissenters technically did not decide the issue, they made clear their view that what they referred to as an anti-eugenics law should be upheld by the supreme court. had that view prevailed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in indiana because of fetal disability.
she points to a tyranny of policies that leaves families without a living wage or access to health care.
full employment doesn't mean that everyone who wants a job has one. it's a term economists use to describe, roughly speaking, the lowest the unemployment rate can be expected to go at any given time. try to pull it even lower, the idea goes, and inflation would be the result.
montanaro: she's going to have to figure out a political strategy because real change - for example, when president obama was in office, when lbj was in office to enact the great society measures or obamacare - came from having numbers and assembling coalitions. and that's something she's going to have to learn how to do.
mcconnell and other republicans argued they had more than a month to agree to an immigration package before daca is set to expire and called on democrats to back the short-term bill in order to give them more time to negotiate.
a new cbo score on the bill is expected monday or tuesday. by the end of next week, there is likely to be a key procedural vote. that would put things on track for a final vote the following week.
united will be looking at what their prospects are in california, lee said.
this time they have just one: blue cross blue shield of south carolina, which had the most obamacare enrollees in richland county in 2016 due to its low prices.

simon: and what have we learned about the trump agenda over the last couple of days?
he said that as a consultant he was able to claim a change in income that allowed him to buy insurance midyear a couple of years ago, when he got some bad results on a prostate screening.
senator mitch mcconnell: now, i agree it's a terrible law. i understand why people harmed by it would want it changed. in fact, i think we ought to repeal it altogether and opt instead for real reforms that would actually lower costs. but the fact is, for now at least, it is the law. and it's the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law.
in ohio, a measure to limit the price on prescription drugs purchased by the state, which was strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, was defeated. the referendum called for capping what the state pays for pharmaceuticals to the same price paid by the federal department of veterans affairs for the same drugs.
inskeep: oh, so if you have money, you're getting good care. you think so, anyway. if you don't have money, it doesn't feel so good.
amid growing questions over the future of obamacare exchanges, the head of california's marketplace said the nation's largest private health insurer should take responsibility for nearly $1 billion in losses and stop blaming the federal health law.
mcghee: no problem. but basically, he went and ended up sort of blaming, you know, implicitly black families for not doing enough to educate their children at home...
the idea is that the job guarantee program could be what economists call an automatic stabilizer — a program that grows when the economy is in a downturn and shrinks when things are going well.
no major candidates have declared that they're preparing a run against president trump in two years, but whispers are building around potential candidates. a few of them have coalesced around a seriously ambitious policy idea — guaranteeing a job for every american who wants one.
hospital and emergency care are considered essential benefits and must be covered, but patients may still have to meet the annual deductible of their policy and pay things like copays and coinsurance on top of that. some large commercial insurers have pledged to waive these patient costs for covid-19 treatment, and several nonprofit community health plans have as well. the limited availability of diagnostic testing may make it tricky to prove you qualify for these benefits, levitt points out.
but beyond the cost, there are other major potential problems. one is that businesses would have to substantially raise prices in order to compensate their employees competitively with the new government jobs.
senator bernie sanders took a lot of criticism from his fellow candidates in last week's presidential debate over his health care plan. so sanders used a recent campaign trip to nevada to defend his medicare for all proposal. npr's scott detrow was there. and just a quick note, this story has an exchange that some listeners might find disturbing.

garcia-navarro: all right, let's start with this week's banner headline story. how do you think the president handled the firing of james comey? rena, let's start with you.
yet this new variant is the same as its predecessor when it comes to subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. it would mostly reduce subsidies and cause out-of-pocket costs to rise, as the cbo said about the previous bill. it's not yet clear how the state grants would alter that dynamic.
simmons says demand at food pantries and soup kitchens has nearly tripled in the mississippi delta.
mcghee: are you paying a for-profit company, or are you paying, you know, the government yourselves, you know, your community? but i also think that, as karen said, this health care conversation is one where there still needs to be a lot more education, which makes sense, right? the idea of medicare for all, although, you know, millions of americans are already on medicare and already love medicare, the idea of transitioning our entire system is a new one. there are pieces of it that are enormously popular already, but they also need more education and more airing.

this election cycle, there's notably broad, public acknowledgement that the concerns and complaints of many white voters are all tied up with race and racially motivated unease. to understand how those national review pieces grapple with white identity politics — whether they intended to or not — we first have to talk about how membership in the club of whiteness has functioned in american political life over time.

the biden campaign says the goal is to ensure that all americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing. it would work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in next-generation testing including home tests and instant tests.
garcia-navarro: but there are people who have benefited?
burwell agrees. is it an important year to make sure that we're getting more folks in and to make that risk pool better? yes, she said.
trump also spent valuable time on monday at a white house event designed to showcase domestic manufacturing. he posed for pictures behind the wheel of a gleaming fire engine built by pierce manufacturing of wisconsin. by coincidence, the white house had staged a similar photo-op with the president at the end of march, the day before a different obamacare replacement bill died in the house.
medicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.
nudo: originally, i'm from italy. so i'm an immigrant - legal immigrant.
chang: ok, let's start with probably the most divisive topic last night - health care. how much did last night's tussle between, say, sanders and warren on the medicare-for-all side and biden on the obamacare side - how much did last night move the health care conversation forward for you, heather?
davis: right. and, you know, obamacare has embedded itself deeper in the nation since that vote in 2015. i talked to one of those senators who's now ready to vote no, lisa murkowski of alaska. and she is one of these senators who's saying, look, now is the time to find the bipartisan consensus on health care. this is what she said.
in new orleans, there are clusters of cases in predominantly black neighborhoods where people mostly work in the tourism industry.
according to the cbo, the original bcra would have cut medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years, and would have resulted in 15 million fewer medicaid enrollees by 2026 than under current law.
new data seems to agree. a washington post-abc news poll out friday found that 48 percent of americans would blame trump and republicans for a shutdown, compared with 28 percent who would blame democrats. the rest of the participants either blamed both equally or had no opinion. a cnn poll also out friday found similar numbers blaming the president and republicans in congress over democrats, though 56 percent said approving a budget deal was more important than a daca deal, while just over a third said they wanted an immigration compromise included.
sagal: voter fraud. i'll give it to you.
garcia-navarro: ok, rena, just one more question on health care - i'd like to bring it back to president trump. do you think he has a clear vision for what health care reform entails?
it's like they dangled the carrot and now they're taking it away, said barton, 38, of bakersfield, an unpaid photographer and stay-at-home mother of two.
the white house dinner was part of a low-key and ultimately unsuccessful lobbying effort by the president. press secretary sean spicer insists trump was actively working for the bill's passage, even though he spent much of the weekend watching the u.s. women's open golf tournament at his bedminster, n.j., resort.
kumar said kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.
for instance, biden's plan says it would direct the cdc to provide specific guidance — based on the degree of viral spread in a community — for when to open or close businesses and schools, when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-home orders may be called for.
the 2018 midterm primary season is really heating up this week, which means it's time to think about elections — like the 2020 democratic presidential primaries.
that's why republican leaders have now pulled out all the stops in their attempts to get rank-and-file members on board. as schumer and other democrats were blasting the bill outside the senate on thursday morning, they had to raise their voices at one point to speak over sirens.

inskeep: very briefly, what struck your ear, more broadly, as you listened to this lawmaker talking about rediscovering the power of public imagination, as she put it?
democrats on monday executed an old move from the playbook used by a party when it doesn't control the majority during a big hearing: changing the subject.
kodjak: it's not an uncommon problem. cheryl vaun lives in albany, ore. and also responded to our poll. she has a low opinion of her health care and the health care in her state. vaun spent years trying to figure out what was wrong with her daughter. who suddenly fell ill as a teenager. the 16-year-old gained weight, had migraines, and her muscles would seize up. they went from doctor to doctor, lab to lab, repeating the same tests and procedures over and over.
here we are at 4 percent unemployment, and we still have lots of pockets of insufficient opportunity, said jared bernstein, former chief economic adviser to vice president joe biden and a senior fellow at the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities. so we need a jobs program.
biden hopes for some wins in southern states, states that specifically have a large, sizable population of black voters. we saw in south carolina, he seems to have a strength there. his intent is, obviously, to collect delegates in as many states as he can, and he will need to reach a 15% threshold in order to collect any delegates. prior to some of these other candidates getting out of the race, there were some questions about whether he could reach that delegate threshold in a state like california. things are certainly looking much better for him in terms of reaching that 15% viability in a lot more places.

for example, analysts have suggested that the gop replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass byrd rule scrutiny either. that's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.

shopping for obamacare opens to mixed reviews from consumers
his message is twofold. first, he explains that the shock of trump's win in wisconsin in 2016 was misplaced. yes, obama had won there twice, but his wins stood in stark contrast to what was going on in the state during his years in office — a drastic rightward shift in the state's power arrangements from the top statewide jobs to the local precinct level.
the real problem, though, has been the marketplace and how insurers have slowly left. this is having an impact - the high deductibles and the lack of options - on real people. i spoke with a mother, corrine bobby (ph), who lives just north of phoenix. and her daughter was born with a complex congenital heart disease. and so she was thrilled when the aca happened and her daughter could get coverage. but even to this day, she can't afford insurance for the rest of her family.
it's just horrible thinking about those people who are having the worst experience in their life and now they're not going to have anywhere to turn in order to get the coverage they need to get their medical care, aguilar said.
on oct. 1, sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in nevada. in the days following the incident, as the campaign slowly released more details about what had actually happened, there were real questions about whether sanders could continue campaigning. he was off the trail for about two weeks.
instead, trump's ascendance has been fueled less by concern over slashing and destroying entitlements, broadly speaking, than by a desire to protect those entitlements for the right people. mr. trump is a political harbinger here of a new strand of populist republicanism ... in which the 'conservative' position is to defend the existing entitlement programs from a perceived threat posed by a new-style obama coalition of handout seekers that includes the chronically unemployed, students, immigrants, minorities and women, wrote the wall street journal's holman jenkins.

trump's and biden's plans for health care
more than half of people who purchase insurance in the health exchanges get the additional help, which reduces out-of-pocket health spending on deductibles and coinsurance. while that help for consumers is required under the law, the funding was not specifically included. (tax credits for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level to help defray the cost of premiums are a separate program and were permanently funded in the aca.)

mcghee: yeah, i think that biden's moment, which is sort of being seen as the record player moment, was actually a really much more damning moment if you go back and look at the transcript.
kodjak: well, that was a pretty different picture. almost half of those people said that they didn't like the health care system in their state. they like their own doctor, but they didn't like the way the whole system worked. it's a little like people's attitudes toward congress. you know, they like their own congressman. they keep re-electing him. but they say they hate the institution of congress. so we were trying to figure out what's going on there. and so we talked to georges benjamin. he's the head of the american public health association. and here's what he said.

brooks: yeah, i think it's an incredibly stupid idea. donald trump - he's - represents a big change in american foreign policy, a big change in american identity. he plays on cultural and identity issues. it's really a comprehensive critique of where the american establishment has been. and what strikes me is the democrats are not even trying to answer that critique. they go to health care. they say, you know, obamacare gives you protection for insurance for pre-existing conditions, and we want to preserve that.
sagal: according to u.s. officials, within a year, blank could develop a missile that could reach the continental u.s.
the american hospital association urged republican leaders to wait until the congressional budget office analyzes the bill.
and this will be a real test for trump. if trump remains honest and seems like a person who's authentic, he's going to go a long way. if under the pressure of this city he starts dissembling and saying things that aren't true, he'll decay as much as obama did well on that.

the fundamental question i had to ask myself in making my decision was this: in today's polarized political environment, is there still a role for a centrist who believes in getting things done through compromise, collegiality, and bipartisanship? collins said in an email to reporters. i have concluded that the answer to this question is 'yes' and i will, therefore, seek the honor of continuing to serve as maine's united states senator.

john holahan, a health-policy researcher at the urban institute, said the obama administration does need to impose stricter rules for special enrollment. he also said concerns over affordability have hampered enrollment because some middle-class consumers and young, healthy people are put off by high premiums and large deductibles.
let's stop with the nonsense. this isn't football. there are no teams. we are the team. it's the united states. don't let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants. we need to take care of each other.

the next place to look is the insurance exchanges set up under the affordable care act. losing health insurance that you got through your job is considered a qualifying event to enroll in a plan on all the health insurance exchanges. that means you can go to healthcare.gov or your state-run exchange and shop for a new plan. the kaiser family foundation has a handy subsidy calculator so you can see what you might pay in premiums for these plans — remember that your unemployment benefits count as income on the exchanges. again, you only have 60 days to choose this option after losing coverage (unless you live in a state that's created a special enrollment period), so be sure and enroll in that time window.
eisbrenner: you know, that's one - that's why, you know - they say how do you grade him on 1 to 10? and i say maybe 7.5. that's one of the little things there that - you know, that and his twitter, i wish he would stop a little bit of that, you know, the reactionary part and, you know, talk to his advisers because sometimes just shooting from the hip, you end up shooting yourself in the foot.
alison kodjak, byline: democrats who supported the affordable care act could use their filibuster power to block trump and congressional republicans from directly repealing the law. but there is a workaround. for bills related to the budget or taxes, the filibuster doesn't apply. and republicans in congress gave it a test drawn earlier this year.
but that needs to happen within 60 days of losing coverage — and especially for people who lost their employer-based insurance in early march, there's no time to lose. here is a guide to a few of the options available to you if you're one of the millions who've recently lost your job and your health insurance:

mccammon: and here trump has said, you know, he wanted to make sure that people with preexisting conditions were still covered, but that's one of the costliest parts of the health care law. he didn't say whether he would keep in place the mandate for coverage and that helps balance out the equation for insurers. he did tell the wall street journal that he and president obama had discussed the law's provisions in their meeting this week. he said he'd consider the president's concerns and that he wasn't sure whether obamacare would be amended or repealed and replaced. of course, during the campaign, he promised - repeal and replace obamacare.
even rep. mark meadows, r-n.c., who negotiated that amendment that won the backing of conservatives, conceded that it could prove problematic in the senate. there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before we can celebrate and all go home, he said in an interview outside the house chamber.
it could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the committee for a responsible federal budget in a blog post.
cornish: but that's hard to sort of frame in 10 days, right? i mean, this is...
coger: it's gotten worse and worse and worse. and now whenever i get up in the mornings, i have to push myself up to sit down on the bed. and then, whenever i get up, i've got to push myself up and sort of limp and lose my balance everywhere until finally my left side starts working properly.
biden won south carolina big, but sanders kept his focus on super tuesday. all along, his campaign's plan was to build up a massive delegate lead that day in states like california and texas, and never look back. sanders campaigned across the country at a frantic pace, holding massive rallies in massachusetts, virginia, texas and elsewhere.
for people like this, a full repeal of obamacare without a replacement would be devastating, aguilar said.
we democrats are here today to tell our republican friends, turn back. drop this irresponsible plan.
the conflation of americanness with whiteness has also determined, at times, who is seen as deserving of help, and who isn't. to create support for the postwar new deal programs that effectively created the white middle class — the gi bill, social security, etc. — legislators baked in the ability to exclude black folks. at the very moment a wide array of public policies were providing most white americans with valuable tools to gain protection in their old age, good jobs, economic security, assets and middle-class status, black americans were mainly left to fend for themselves, writes ira katnelson, a political scientist at columbia.
senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., traveled friday afternoon to the white house to meet with president trump, and the white house struck an optimistic tone afterward, but ultimately the high-level meeting proved unsuccessful.
gingrich: and somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.
sen. susan collins, the maine republican who is one of the few members of her party willing to buck president trump, announced wednesday she would seek reelection. her announcement comes the same day the u.s. house of representatives began debate on impeaching the president.
i'm sorry he does not understand, cassidy said wednesday morning on cnn about kimmel, adding that under the new bill, more people will have coverage.
so while trump makes a very comprehensive, mostly cultural and identity critique, the democrats come back with a materialist response, which is, we're going to protect your benefits. and that's a decent response in normal times, but in times like this, i think the democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism, in defense of diversity, a big argument against what trump really stands for.
a jobs guarantee program can take different forms, but the basic idea behind any program is the same, according to darity.
rovner: well, that's clearly going to be the subject of a lot of debate. but it appears most likely, particularly in the case of the employer requirement, the administration probably does have the authority. and even if it doesn't, it's not clear who would be able to show enough harm to go to court to stop it.

sagal: bill, did adam do well enough to win?
if you don't qualify for medicaid, next look to the state insurance exchanges that were set up under the aca. the trump administration has decided not to open a special enrollment period for healthcare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. but some states run their own insurance marketplaces and have created a special enrollment period during the coronavirus crisis. in these states — including hard-hit places like california and new york — that means you don't need to have a qualifying event like job-based coverage loss or the birth of a child to newly enroll right now in an obamacare plan.
create a public option health care plan that expands off the affordable care act.
on one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by house leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the affordable care act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. the cbo estimated that under the original version of the house bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.
if there's a time that people particularly need access to good health care and health insurance, it's during a global pandemic.
florida sen. marco rubio voiced similar worries to the new york times. ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell want the bill on president trump's desk by the end of april. i think if that's the approach they take, they won't have the votes in the senate, rubio warned.
kaufman marshals copious data in making his case. but his story comes to life through his profiles of key players in his home state. most are progressive democrats or activists who have been resisting the state's rightward shift for years. these include current and former legislators such as tim cullen and chris taylor and candidates who ran quixotic challenges to entrenched incumbents.
believes presidents should be protected from lawsuits and criminal investigations: the starr report to congress outlined information that potentially constituted grounds for the impeachment of president clinton, as the almanac of the federal judiciary notes. and yet, kavanaugh wrote this in 2009 in the minnesota law review about presidential investigations, which is sure to please president trump:

dorothy johnson, 57, a caterer who lives in a mobile home with her disabled husband, was disappointed that the lowest obamacare premium would still cost her $56 a month, even with a subsidy.
khalid: that's the background noise you probably hear (laughter). i was in dallas last night, where biden got the endorsement of pete buttigieg, amy klobuchar and beto o'rourke. and, you know, when you listen to the former vice president, he kind of seems to speak with a renewed vigor. here's a snippet.
sagal: on thursday, former presidential candidate blank announced the title of her new book would be, quote, what happened.
kodjak: in our poll, coger rated the health care system poor. he injured his back about 15 years ago hauling pipe out of a water well on his property. it didn't seem too bad at first.
inskeep: and just that basic question, is your doctor listening to you? is your doctor talking to you in a way that you understand? really, really important.
but what would biden do? biden's campaign has a seven-point plan to beat covid-19 and other proposals for health care and economic recovery that support that vision. npr asked his advisers for details on his approach, which includes some familiar elements, as well as some less-expected ones.
stone: they were looking at premiums costing the rest of them $400 to $600 a month and deductibles of more than $6,000 per person. and they just decided, you know, it's not worth it.
in november, unitedhealth surprised analysts and health-policy experts with its steep losses and said it might leave the exchanges altogether, just after expanding into new states. the sudden reversal prompted questions about the sustainability of the government-run marketplaces, the linchpin of president obama's signature law.

how trump could repeal several parts of the affordable care act
chang: well, beyond health care - we have just about one minute left. we invited the two of you to this week's chat because you represent different parts of the democratic party. we're hearing so much about the progressive-moderate split among the democratic contenders. where else beyond health care did you see that split last night? karen, let's start with you.
and republicans in the senate have their own internal disagreements, too.
but kimmel said the latest bill doesn't pass the test. he used his late night platform to knock down cassidy's health care plan, which the gop is trying to pass by the end of the month, point by point. he said cassidy, whom kimmel quizzed on his show before the plan came out, lied right to my face.
simmons-duffin: yeah. it's a reminder of the politics here. the very law that expanded medicaid and created these insurance exchanges is the affordable care act - obamacare. so trump feels he was elected in part on his promise to get rid of that law. congress wasn't able to do it back in 2017. the administration is still fighting to strike it down now in court. this fall, the supreme court is planning to hear the trump administration's arguments against the law. so this might all explain the reluctance here to make use of obamacare by making a special enrollment period that could be seen as an admission that the law is helpful during this crisis.
montanaro: well, you know, the - this green new deal is obviously something that democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. they know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.

it costs more to shut down the government than to keep it running. standard & poor's estimated that the 2013 government shutdown, lasting 16 days, cost the economy $24 billion and shaved 0.6 percent off the economic growth for the fourth quarter that year.

in september, a man in carson city, nev., told sanders he was considering suicide because of six-figure medical debt. campaign staffers credited these intense moments — always livestreamed and repackaged on social media by the campaign — as validating and amplifying sanders' push to overhaul the american health care system.
he also spoke at length about the necessity of humility. part of being a good judge, he said, is don't be a jerk.
khalid: and, you know, within that answer, ari, i think there were obviously - there was, obviously, a subtext of bernie sanders. you know, he is somebody who wants to replace obamacare with medicare for all and has these bold promises that joe biden is sort of skeptical of; whether or not he can actually - whether or not any politician could actually implement them. i think what's most notable in terms of the new energy around biden is that we have very quickly seen the establishment - we have seen other moderate candidates in this field coalesce around joe biden as the single alternative to bernie sanders ahead of super tuesday. and that has happened with remarkable speed.
in 2018, sanders told npr that he didn't especially care whether the progressive candidates he was endorsing were winning their primaries. the point, he said, was to push the policies and the platforms more and more into the mainstream. i hope they win, he said in his senate office. maybe they don't. but if you get 45% of the vote now, next time you may well win. you have to start somewhere.
the magazine's warnings have clearly gone unheeded by much of the republican rank and file. but the review is still at it. earlier this month, it published an incendiary essay by kevin williamson, one of its most reliably provocative writers, titled chaos in the family, chaos in the state: the white working class's dysfunction.

perhaps trump's easiest action — and the one that would produce the largest impact — would be to drop the administration's appeal of a lawsuit filed by republican house members in 2014. that suit, house v. burwell, charged that the obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders — those earning between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty line.
the public option would be offered with no premiums to americans who live in states that don't have access to medicaid benefits that they would qualify for in other states.
trump: we're going to very much try and keep that in. adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.
6. aoc helps bernie bounce back
perhaps most important, cato's cannon says, is not whether trump could single-handedly undo the health law, but whether he could undermine it enough to force congress to take action. if trump were to do just enough to cause the insurance exchanges to fail, he said, that would put pressure on congress ... to reopen the law.
cornish: all the reporting on this makes it sound like there's just a ton of infighting. what was the atmosphere on the capitol today?
gingrich: right. that will not last. this is not a country that wanders around trusting people with power. this is a country that wants accountability. they want some sense - now, again, he is unique. and i totally defend him against those who, for example, want him to put his holdings in a blind trust, which is an absurd...

you might view the dust-up over the national review pieces as conservatives fighting over where the line in the sand between real americans and everybody else rightly belongs. the establishment view seems pretty clear: those who reach for government handouts need not apply. but huge swaths of white, working-class americans seem to see things differently this election cycle: real americans — like them — deserve help, and everyone else needs to shape up or ship out.
pollitz: you can't be turned down based on your health status. you can't charge customers more based on their health status.
but where i disagree with david - i think he's trying to generalize it too much in saying, oh, this is all politics. there's a fundamental problem here, which is that president trump's hold on power depends on dividing the nation. it's not just that he's incapable of being a uniter. it's that unity is a dire threat to his political standing. and, you know, at 3:14 this morning, he tweeted an attack on cnn. and then later he sent out a tweet that - complaining that this bomb stuff - that's his phrase - was hurting the republicans in the election. there's something very specific here about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support president trump - is incapable of talking out against him.

look, i have no illusions that under a republican senate and a very right-wing house and an extremely right-wing president of the united states that suddenly we're going to see a medicare-for-all, single-payer passed, sanders told npr at the time. you're not going to see it. that's obvious.
biden also wants to allocate $775 billion toward a plan for child and elder care. a lot of the funding would go toward cutting medicaid waitlists for people needing home and community care, and to provide tax breaks to people who care for older family members.
in april 2015, most democrats saw former secretary of state hillary clinton as the party's inevitable 2016 nominee. president obama was urging vice president joe biden not to mount a bid, and many other prominent democrats, including massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, decided not to run either.
kodjak: georges benjamin of the public health association says coger and his doctors don't seem to have the same goal. they're managing his pain. he wants to get back to work.
clinton was not drawing crowds anywhere near that size, even as she maintained wide polling leads over sanders and often tried to ignore his candidacy.
khalid: well, the rallies are certainly busy. and when i talk to voters - i will say earlier on in iowa and new hampshire, i heard a lot about electability. i continue to hear about electability, but it seems like people are more convinced in their choices for other reasons. yesterday, at a rally in houston, i met pablo fernandez. he's a biden supporter who told me he likes the former vice president's message of unity. he feels like a lot of politics these days is polarizing, and he wants somebody who's going to be a unifier.
sagal: this week, president trump awarded medals of valor to the officers who responded to the shooting at a congressional blank game.
kelly: ok. what about another group of people - people who maybe didn't have coverage to begin with before this pandemic? that's a number - that's, like, 27 million people who didn't have insurance.
it's the senate's turn house passage of the american health care act is just a first step. as this measure moves to the senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. among them: medicaid: the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.
the second provision prohibited insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on most benefits in most plans.
a potential vote to overturn crucial cases
kodjak: all of which make health insurance more expensive. pollitz says this combination would lead healthy people who think insurance is too expensive to drop their policies and sick people to buy. insurance companies will then raise prices to account for their sicker customer base, leaving more people to drop insurance.
sanders will not win the presidency this year. but whether it's next year or at some point in the future, the next democratic president will very likely try to pass a substantial part of the agenda sanders has pushed for over the past five years.

gingrich: sure. the constitution gives the president of the united states an extraordinarily wide grant of authority to use the power of the pardon. i'm not saying he should. i'm not saying he will. it also allows the president, in a national security moment, to say to somebody - go do x, even if it's technically against the law. and i'm - here's your pardon because i'm ordering you as commander in chief to go do this.

john mcdonough: last fall and january of this year, they demonstrated quite convincingly that they could frame a budget reconciliation bill, get it through the house, get it through the senate, get it to the president's desk, which they did. president obama vetoed it. president trump would sign that bill.
[it is a lie] that the white working class that finds itself attracted to trump has been victimized by outside forces. it hasn't. the white middle class may like the idea of trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the cathedral, they may sing hymns to trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about globalists and — odious, stupid term — the establishment, but nobody did this to them. they failed themselves. ... if you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate new york, or eastern kentucky, or my own native west texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy — which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog — you will come to an awful realization. ... the truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die.

kaufman does include in these pages some of the elements of wisconsin history that further cloud its image as a progressive bastion. there were generations of fierce resistance to unionization, strikes that lasted for years, violence that took lives. he even unearths a particularly eye-opening episode in the 1960s, when alabama's segregationist gov. george wallace came to the state and did rather well in the democratic presidential primary – not once but twice.
there will be many people — more than 5 million — who won't have access to insurance they can afford, even with the options mentioned above. if you can't get a health plan for the adults in your family, your children might still be able to get coverage — the rules are different for them, as well as for pregnant women. insurekidsnow.gov is a good place to start to determine if your children may be eligible.
in addition, biden would push to strengthen the affordable care act. that means expanding coverage, murthy says, for instance by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. biden would also push for expansion of medicaid in states that have still yet to do so, his advisers say, and he has proposed making medicare coverage available to americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65).
but the plans often have more limitations in what they cover than aca plans do. they're allowed to restrict enrollment to those without preexisting conditions, for example, and don't have to cover all essential benefits included in all obamacare plans. they might exclude prescription drugs; they might cap how much they'll pay in a hospital, says levitt. so if you look at one of these short-term plans, you really want to read the fine print carefully.
writing for a three-judge panel in 2016, he argued that the watchdog agency, created under the guidance of sen. elizabeth warren after the financial crisis, placed excessive power in the hands of an agency with no congressional oversight and funded by the federal reserve. kavanaugh wrote:
block: here in the industrial midwest, decker says voters heard an economic message that tapped into their fears.
gingrich: it's something i've talked to the transition team about.
then the second thing is obamacare insurance exchanges. losing job-based coverage is a qualifying event, so you can shop for a plan there. the third option is medicaid, so the rules about who qualifies varies from state to state, but it's based on monthly income. you have to make less than $1,400 a month for yourself or $3,000 a month for a family of four in most states to qualify.
that's something democrats are homing in on. look: no one likes this bill, said senate minority leader chuck schumer. hospitals, doctors, governors. conservatives, liberals, nonpartisan groups. and most of all, the people who would no longer have affordable health care.
in late october he was pretty upset because he got a letter from his insurer, anthem blue cross and blue shield, saying his policy was going up about $200 a month. even after his subsidy, he thought he'd be paying $500 a month just for his premium. on top of that he spends about $300 a month on medications to control his diabetes.
kelly: so take me back to 2015. what exactly happened? how did this hiv outbreak begin?
the democrats showed barrett huge photos of the constituents whose stories they told, including with big placards that staff members set up behind sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota and sen. richard blumenthal of connecticut.
but the baby's lungs were fine, kimmel said, which meant his heart wasn't. so now more doctors and nurses and equipment come in. it's — it's a terrifying thing. you know, my wife is back in the recovery room, she has no idea what's going on. and i'm standing in the middle of a lot of very worried-looking people — kind of like right now — who are trying to figure out what the problem is.
one of the most immediate steps vice president biden would be able to take is to reopen open enrollment as needed so people who have lost insurance can sign up for new coverage, feldman says, calling it a basic step that president trump has refused to do.
sarah dash: health care hasn't always been designed with the needs and the efficiency of the patient in mind. it's designed for the various doctors in the health care system.
three quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.
the key thing about this moment is that when it happened, it didn't feel key at all.
likely 2020 democratic candidates want to guarantee a job to every american
week in politics: midterms, suspicious packages and the migrant caravan
williamson's piece predictably raised lots of eyebrows — in right-wing circles and beyond — and david a. french, also at the national review, came to his colleague's defense in a post responding to the backlash. kevin is right, french wrote. if getting a job means renting a u-haul, rent the u-haul. you have nothing to lose but your government check. (french doubled down again this week with a post titled, the great white working-class debate: just because i'm 'nasty' doesn't mean i'm wrong.)
another disturbing trend is the high proportion of coronavirus cases and deaths among african-americans.
mcghee: i agree. i think that, you know, frankly, the american people are paying lots of different people a lot of money for their health care and still not getting the results that they want. and so it is true that people think about, how much, you know, money do i have left at the end of my paycheck? and so i think it makes sense for the warren, you know, sanders wing to talk about it in terms of overall cost.

brooks: i do think it is a permanent shift. if you ask working-class americans why their incomes have stagnated, the two answers they give are immigration and trade. and so a lot more people have come to see immigration not only as a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well.
cornish: david, the democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care. how are you thinking about that?
president trump's nomination of judge amy coney barrett to fill the supreme court seat made vacant by the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg is seen as a home run for conservatives. it is a chance to move the high court in a far more aggressively conservative direction for generations.
let me ask you a question or two. what do you think of your doctor? and what do you think of america's health care system? npr has been posing those questions in a survey that was conducted with the robert wood johnson foundation and the harvard t.h. chan school of public health. we have the results this morning. they'll be presented by npr health policy correspondent alison kodjak, who's in studios. good morning.

republicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the affordable care act. they have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by president obama.
all national security and military personnel deemed essential would continue to report to work, but they wouldn't get paid. that includes active-duty u.s. troops, unless congress passes separate legislation to make sure their paychecks go out. lawmakers, however, face no such threat. members of congress continue to get paid in a government shutdown.
michigan and pennsylvania also ended long democratic streaks that night. but the badger state was the big shock, because barack obama had carried it twice by comfortable margins and hillary clinton had led all through the fall in the most respected statewide poll.
trump called on the senate to change its rules so any bill could be passed with just 51 votes. he neglected to mention that the failed repeal-and-replace measure fell short of that simple majority.
a sea change for the supreme court
stone: this is mostly in the hands of the federal government right now. arizona was not one of the states that set up its own exchange. it participates in the healthcare.gov. and leading up to open enrollment last year, we saw the federal governor making efforts to woo insurers back into the marketplace, even after they were concerned about costs and losing money. the question is - will the trump administration do the same? - and i think that's what a lot of folks who rely on the coverage right now are wondering.
president-elect donald trump said during his trip to washington, d.c., we can't get started fast enough. he has yet to name any cabinet members. there's been a lot of speculation. he did announce his transition team yesterday. those are the people who will help him make those choices. npr's sarah mccammon has been covering the trump campaign and joins us now. thanks for being with us.
the public option plan is described as available to all americans, whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, adding that the option is like medicare — but is not medicare.
inskeep: good to talk with you. she is npr's health policy correspondent. and there's going to be more about this poll online at npr.org. the series continues today on all things considered.
blindsided by the latest collapse of a republican health care bill, president trump took to twitter to voice his frustration. trump complained of being let down by a handful of republican lawmakers. and he insisted that the fight over the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, is not over.
sagal: bill, how did roxanne do on our quiz?

senate democrats stood firm in refusing to vote for a stopgap measure without an agreement for long-term increases in military and domestic spending and a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700,000 immigrants. those are individuals who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children and are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals program established by the obama administration. those protections from deportation are set to begin expiring in march after the trump administration announced it was rescinding daca last year.
house leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent house debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.
cornish: julie, thanks so much for walking us through it.
mccarthy's staff in washington, d.c., said there wasn't anyone available to comment.
as far as higher prices, darity believes that is not a serious argument against a job guarantee.
a company spokesman declined to comment on lee's criticism, and referred to unitedhealth's previous statements on the exchange business.
if biden wins the election, you would see an approach that's driven by science and by scientists, says physician vivek murthy, who is a key adviser to the biden campaign on covid-19.
i have not made up my mind, collins, one of 100 u.s. senators who would serve as jurors in the president's senate trial, told npr. and i think it would be inappropriate for me to have made up my mind before i hear the presentations from both sides.
trump absolutely, through executive action, could have tremendous interference to the point of literally stopping a train on its tracks, said sara rosenbaum, a professor of law and health policy at george washington university in washington, d.c.
sagal: right. she began picking up fares.
davis: you know, there are put up or shut up moments in life, audie, and this is one for the united states senate and republicans in the senate. mcconnell is essentially asking republicans to vote for something they've already voted for. this is a rehash of a 2015 vote in which every republican senator except one - susan collins of maine - voted to essentially repeal all of obamacare and didn't offer much to replace it with. and one advocate of this strategy is kentucky senator rand paul. and this is what he had to say today.
to me that the takeaway from this report is that the affordable care act is serving as the safety net it was intended to be, says sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university. of course, the ultimate irony is it's performing this function at a time when the trump administration is arguing before the supreme court that it should be struck down.
the military would still go to work, they will not get paid. the border will still be patrolled, they will not get paid, said mulvaney, the director of the office of management and budget. folks will still be fighting the fires out west, they will not get paid. parks will be open, people won't get paid.
sagal: after users protested, microsoft announced this week that it would not kill off its blank drawing program.
the new bill makes some big changes from the last bcra draft, but it also leaves some major parts of the original senate proposal intact — it would still repeal the individual and employer mandates, it would still mean cuts to medicaid spending, and it would still allow states to opt out of key parts of obamacare.
harper: critics would say that governor pence responded too slowly. many people were calling for indiana to legalize syringe exchange programs, where someone who uses drugs can bring their used needles and get clean ones. other states allow this, and they help prevent infections. but pence was really resistant to that idea for a while. here he is back in 2015.
dionne: good to be with you.
shortly after the brief appeared on the court's docket late thursday, house speaker nancy pelosi said in a statement: president trump and the republicans' campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the affordable care act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty.
researchers at the kaiser family foundation dispute that ominous picture. they argue the individual insurance market is stabilizing in most parts of the country, although deliberate moves by the administration could undermine that. npr's danielle kurtzleben made the same point in march.
but in the u.s. 33.5 million people so far have had to file for unemployment benefits — and most people in the nation get their health insurance through their jobs. an analysis from the kaiser family foundation published wednesday estimates that 27 million people have recently lost their health coverage.
inskeep: each one of those is for a minority of people, in other words.
pablo fernandez: people call the tea partiers the deplorables, but i really feel that both sides, both extremes are equally deplorable because they're hate-filled. we don't need hate. we need unison.
but mccarthy seems to want a quick repeal. he told reporters that ending the affordable care act is easier and faster than passing an alternative policy, which would require more votes.
sanders campaigned across the country against president trump and congressional republicans' push to repeal obamacare, and then he reintroduced his signature medicare-for-all health care plan.
gingrich: it is big. but on the other hand, you know, as speaker of the house and then later having worked with the bush administration, i've been working on these issues for 58 years. you know, i have - you know, and i've really spent a long time trying to think about - what do we need to do to get this government to be effective?
stahl: you're going to keep that.
sagal: it's groening, but i'll give it to you.
the next day, sanders vowed to stay in the race, but conceded that, while our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability.
simon: vice president-elect pence is going to lead the team. new jersey governor chris christie apparently has been demoted from that role. forgive this, but was he just a bridge too far at this point?
enter dan kaufman, who grew up in wisconsin and now writes for magazines in new york. in the fall of wisconsin: the conservative conquest of a progressive bastion and the future of american politics (norton), he tries to explain what happened in 2016 as part of a far larger story.
— he lists being a lecturer at harvard law (for which he was paid $27,220), the director of the d.c. circuit historical society and an adviser to the american law institute.
yeah, probably. even at full employment, some groups are persistently far more fully employed than others.
she and her husband had been shopping for life insurance, but they've decided they can't afford it as well as health insurance.

earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that subsidies designed to cut the costs in some policies are illegal. that's because congress didn't appropriate money for the payments which go to health insurers. dropping the appeal would leave the court ruling in place.
i think it's important not to prejudge the facts of the case or the evidence that is presented, collins told npr.
i think that health care is just a mess, and he's obviously trying to move something forward on that. and i think that everyone needs to be behind the president and working together to get this taken care of for the people. whether it's eradicating obamacare or making something new, the people are suffering, and we need to be united and be behind the president to help the people. and so i think he's really trying to move that forward. so i'd give him a lot of progress points on that.
the early evidence of that is from louisiana, where the death toll has now surpassed that of hurricane katrina. african-americans make up 56% of reported covid deaths, but just about one-third of the state's population. other southern states show similar disproportionate impacts on african-american residents.
bentlage said he's glad he doesn't have to go without insurance like he did before the affordable care act. at that time he couldn't find coverage because of his diabetes.
in some ways the individual market looks today much like it did before the aca, from a competitive standpoint, pearson says.
sagal: on wednesday, president trump announced plans to nominate kansas governor blank as ambassador of religious freedom.
health policy analysts on both sides of the aisle also still question where health care fits on trump's priority list.

rovner: well, here was senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, one of many who were complaining about these rules.
trump is against keeping the affordable care act, but he hasn't proposed a detailed alternative. during an abc town hall last month, trump was unable to explain his campaign's proposed alternative other than saying the current law is too expensive. he also did not outline a plan in the first presidential debate against biden.
thanks so much for being with us.
a job for everyone sounds great. what could go wrong?
sagal: this week, forbes announced that blank had dethroned bill gates to become the world's richest person for a moment.
though the 78-year-old did not emerge as the democratic nominee in either of his two presidential bids, his campaigns have reshaped the party's politics and policy in significant ways. here's a look back at several key moments from the past five years:
as kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. those groans revealed something else — the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c.
i've done it before, he said. and my broker helped me. and the great thing was we got an answer within two minutes.
so from my view here, the aca was a good thing to get people with pre-existing conditions health insurance, he said.
mcghee: he was asked, what can americans do, what responsibility...
sagal: this week, a woman in philadelphia was arrested for stealing a taxi and then blanking.
uncertainty surrounds the future of the exchanges after the trump administration and republican-led congress take power. worries about the future of obamacare may be spurring a burst in enrollments, which were up by 400,000 to 6.4 million from nov. 1 to dec. 19, compared with the same period last year, the government reported.
some analysts have suggested that the house amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the senate's byrd rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.
as gop hails barrett, democrats convene a parallel hearing: about health care
the president has been an erratic negotiator in recent days, throwing already-contentious talks into disarray. after initially suggesting he would support any bipartisan proposal lawmakers could come up with, trump rejected a proposal authored by graham, a republican, and senate minority whip dick durbin, d-ill., on the advice of more conservative lawmakers and his own top white house aides.
mccammon: you know, trump has said they will be running his business while he's president, and he's promised it would be in a blind trust. and that's intended to shield him from conflicts of interest. but, of course, these are his children, and it's clear that they're continuing to take an active role in the transition to a trump administration. we know that they've been in and out of meetings at trump tower in new york this week. and it's not clear exactly what their role will be, but federal law prohibits federal employees - and that includes the president - from hiring immediate family members to agencies that they control, which is a lot of agencies if you're the president. and that also would include his son-in-law jared kushner, who's played an important role in the campaign and was seen taking a walk this week with white house chief-of-staff denis mcdonough.
democrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. as the republicans reached a majority for the bill, democrats on the house floor began chanting, na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. they say republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.
npr white house reporter ayesha rascoe and political correspondent asma khalid contributed to this report.
kodjak: as in killing the insurance market. an even faster way for a president trump to deal a blow to obamacare would be to drop an obama administration appeal of a court ruling against the law.
some gop senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. others, however, describe these credits as obamacare lite. planned parenthood funding: the house would defund this reproductive health organization for a year — a step that draws opposition from a handful of senate republicans.
on the other hand, constituents like barton worry about the consequences of repealing the health law without an immediate replacement. they fear losing all or part of their health coverage, or losing jobs in the health care industry.
what's her biggest challenge? helping people focus on what the consumer pays because that's the most important thing, burwell said in an interview with npr on oct. 26, and that's what consumers actually care about.
i think that we could be heading for a macabre game of whack-a-mole, says thomas laveist, dean of the school of public health and tropical medicine at tulane university in new orleans. he worries that louisiana — an early hot spot for covid-19 — could see a resurgence in cases as surrounding states ease restrictions.
perhaps the one issue that recurs most often in kaufman's diagnosis is the near extinction of unions as a political force. private sector union participation was down to 8 percent by 2016, he says, and those who remained were not nearly numerous or generous enough to compete with the gop's coffers.

this idea of place in our system of government is critical. ours is a government of separated powers. the power to make, enforce, and interpret the law isn't centralized in one person or one branch of government, said sen. chuck grassley of iowa, a top member of the panel.
read details of biden's plans below.
whatever your party, whatever you believe, whoever you support, we need to make sure that the people who are supposed to represent us, people who are meeting about this right now in washington, understand that very clearly, kimmel said.
aron says president trump has made clear his two qualifications for a supreme court justice: she must be opposed to roe v. wade, and the candidate has to, like trump, do whatever she can to overturn the affordable care act. aron, and others, contend that barrett's record fits the bill on both counts, and much more.
for seven years, i've been hearing repeal and replace from congress, trump said. and then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it. so that's disappointing.
sanders gained more and more momentum in november, december and january. he won new hampshire and nevada, while essentially tying buttigieg atop the muddled iowa caucuses.
martin: so what does that look like?
garcia-navarro: ok. kevin, do you think he did the right thing?
denecke, 63, is a self-employed urban planning consultant in portland, ore. he makes too much money to quality for financial assistance.
garcia-navarro: well, kevin, do you think that the gop health care bill, as passed, really does the best for the majority of americans?
in terms of lowering costs on the individual health insurance marketplace, his proposal would do away with the income cap — which currently stands at 400% of the federal poverty line — that enables eligibility to receive a tax credit to help pay for premiums. the plan also would ensure that no household is putting more than 8.5% of their earnings (instead of the current 9.86%) into health insurance plans.
under the conditions of a federal job guarantee, everybody would be assured of getting to work if they were seeking work. so in effect, the unemployment rate would be zero, said darity. in an ideal world, if i lost my job in the morning, i could walk over to what we would now truly call an employment office and have new work by the afternoon.
mcghee: ...health care, which is what the republicans want to do.
nearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they're required to use don't have a place to include patients' end-of-life preferences. even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn't access its actual contents.
though not explicitly mentioned in his proposal, biden has said that undocumented immigrants would be able to buy into the public option plan and receive unsubsidized coverage — an option currently not allowed under the affordable care act.

so it's not surprising that a popular — formerly fairly apolitical — late night host with a compelling personal storyline to draw on could have a broader effect than other traditional influencers.
still, some in mccarthy's district will be glad to see obamacare go, and as soon as possible. this whole system has been a disaster from day 1, said rodger harmel, an insurance agent in bakersfield. rates have been at an all-time high.
for many, fewer obamacare choices doesn't mean higher prices
brooks: well, he could have been worse in the last couple days.
president trump has chosen brett kavanaugh, a conservative judge from the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit — often thought of as the second-most-powerful court in the country — to replace justice anthony kennedy on the supreme court.
but it turns out the computer system being developed for the exchanges won't be able to process that, at least not for the first year. so it turns out the smoking surcharges will pretty much have to be the same percentage for all smokers, regardless of age, at least for 2014.
the cbo's estimate makes clear that trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of american families, said schumer. tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.
the survey was commissioned by the john a. hartford foundation, the california health care foundation and cambia health foundation. (california healthline is an editorially independent publication of the california health care foundation.)
now, to dig into this more and the politics of the week, i want to bring in e.j. dionne of the washington post and brookings institution. hey there, e.j.
dionne: well, right, but they - the - i think what they are doing - what they have to do is say, we're not for open borders, and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics, to health care and to the issues that a lot of voters are voting on to the point where republicans have had to essentially mislead - that's a terrible word - about where they stand on health care. and i think they are doing that quite effectively in a lot of local races, governors' races and i think in a great many house races, too.
kelly: so for the millions of people who have just filed for unemployment, what are their coverage options?
i want to make sure it gets done right, he said of replacing obamacare in an interview with the washington post.
kimmel laid out four points that cassidy had said he wanted in a health care bill:
burwell would like to see some changes to the law that might help lower premiums for consumers and health costs overall.
politico adds that voters hope to bypass state legislators hostile to the obamacare program that sank past efforts. that dynamic has also squashed medicaid expansion efforts in tennessee, wyoming and south dakota, where gop governors tried and failed to get legislative backing for expansion plans. in kansas, the gop-controlled legislature passed legislation earlier this year only to see it vetoed by gov. sam brownback.
extra stabilization money, in part for high-risk customers. the original version of the bcra provided $112 billion that would have allowed states to stabilize their markets or help high-risk customers in a wide variety of ways. in this version, that is bumped up to $182 billion. one function of this money is to mitigate some of the two-tier issues created by new, nonqualified plans. if an insurer offers a plan that meets the obamacare criteria, that insurer would be eligible for money to help high-risk customers.
while trump made limited use of the defense production act to increase ventilator production, biden says he'd use it to increase production of masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment so that supply exceeds demand.
health care is such an integral part of the economy, said phelps, adding that he hopes mccarthy will look into the details before scrapping obamacare. you just can't turn off the switch.
kodjak: coger's a carpenter by trade, but now he's on disability and medicaid. our new poll shows that lower-income people like coger are more likely to be dissatisfied with their health care. he sees doctors at a local clinic but says they don't take his back trouble seriously. they recommend exercise and offer ibuprofen but refuse to offer an mri. he thinks surgery could help him. but they won't talk about it.
sanders came out of 2016 as a national leader in the party he still hadn't joined. top democrats embraced him and sought his validation — even when it was awkward.

california exchange chief rips unitedhealth for obamacare excuses
a lack of competition is bad for the insurance market in the long term, but in counties that have only one plan it hasn't proven to be catastrophic for consumers for 2017, says caroline pearson, a senior vice president with avalere. we expected to see the biggest price hikes in areas without competition.
obama, by the way, had a similar election but couldn't sustain it, partly because he kept lying.

but then, there are people working part time who want full-time work, and there are discouraged workers who have stopped looking for work. those people are not counted in the headline unemployment rate. but count all of them, and by its broadest definition, unemployment stands at around 7.8 percent.
on the bench, to put it in the vernacular, don't be a jerk. i think that's important. to be a good umpire and a good judge, don't be a jerk. and in your opinions, to demonstrate civility; i think that's important as well. to show, to help display that you're trying to make a decision impartially and dispassionately, based on the law and not based on your emotions.

obamacare must 'fall,' trump administration tells supreme court
in response to industry criticism, the obama administration is taking steps to prevent the misuse of special enrollment so people can't wait to sign up until they need care. special enrollment is designed for people who lose coverage or need to make a change because of an event in their life, such as moving, getting married or having a child.
but there's a surprising bottom line: although prices are going up in almost all areas, they're not significantly higher than they are for people living in areas served by multiple insurers, according to data reviewed by consulting firm avalere health.
who is brett kavanaugh, president trump's pick for the supreme court?
in april, federal district court judge rosemary collyer ruled in favor of the house republicans. such an appropriation cannot be inferred, she wrote of the payments, and insurer reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the constitution. however, collyer declined to enforce her decision, pending an appeal to a higher court. that appeal was filed in july and is still months away from resolution.
then ryan applied some public pressure. we as republicans have been waiting seven years to do this. we as republicans, who fought the creation of [obamacare], and accurately predicted it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, on a promise that if given the ability we would repeal and replace this law.
garcia-navarro: you think this is all inside-the-beltway obsession. it's just the journalists and the pundits talking to each other and the...
sagal: that rivals the cubs' big comeback.
the black unemployment rate is always twice that of the white rate, he added. and i gotta tell you, that's not written in the good book somewhere. that's the outcome of a persistent market failure that's very much leavened by racial discrimination.
most notably: booker, new york democratic sen. kirsten gillibrand and sanders. in addition, the intercept recently reported that massachusetts democratic sen. elizabeth warren has begun looking closely at the idea.
harry reid: it's my house. i can put my hat on if i want, right?
let's chat now with one of president-elect donald trump's most high-profile advisers. it's former house speaker newt gingrich who, like trump, led a political upheaval. that was 1994. gingrich helped republicans take control of both houses of congress for the first time in decades on a set of promises called the contract with america. gingrich spoke with our morning edition colleague rachel martin. rachel began by asking what he thinks trump needs to do in the first hundred days to satisfy those who voted him into office.
it's more than that, though. barrett is willing to go the extra mile when necessary — for instance, going to bat for laura wolk, a blind student who upon entering the law school, found the school computer software didn't allow her to access law books and other legal material in a format she needed to read for her classes. as wolk recounts, when she told barrett about it, barrett replied, this is one i absolutely can take off your plate.
barrett closely identifies with the justice she once clerked for, the late antonin scalia, who more than any other justice popularized the idea of originalism, meaning that the court should interpret the constitution as it was originally intended by the founders. but scalia, at the same time, often referred to himself as a faint-hearted originalist because he also embraced one of the other building blocks of legal interpretation, namely, adhering to precedent, even when, in his view, some of those precedents conflicted with what the founding fathers thought when they ratified the constitution.
there are currently several home test kits that give quick results without being sent to a laboratory in development, but none are yet fda-approved. while there has been a significant expansion in testing, we're still encountering shortages, murthy says. testing is still not available and affordable to all people across the country, he says.
not only did he fail the 'jimmy kimmel test,'  kimmel said, it failed the 'bill cassidy test.'
the nonpartisan congressional budget office hasn't yet analyzed the new bill. it weighed in on the earlier senate bill, saying that proposal would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage in the next 10 years, compared with under the affordable care act. of those, 15 million would lose medicaid coverage. that version was projected to lower the deficit by billions over 10 years — but that may have changed as the latest version offers billions more for state grants and also doesn't repeal as many of the obamacare taxes.
the complexities of repealing obamacare are laid bare in the 23rd congressional district that mccarthy represents, highlighting what other republican politicians from less affluent areas may face.
thank you so much for your time.
